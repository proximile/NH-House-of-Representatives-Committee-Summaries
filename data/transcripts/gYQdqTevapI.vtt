committee I supported the board of
 
00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
realtors concerns initially a motion was
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%

that failed another motion was made to
 
00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:41.700 align:start position:0%
not recommend future legislation that
 
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
passed by a vote of three to two for
 
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
this session I make a motion that this
 
00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:49.620 align:start position:0%

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.130 align:start position:0%

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
I think I've said uh what I'd like to
 
00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:25.580 align:start position:0%
say on Mr chairman thank you of
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:36.780 align:start position:0%
my chair recognizes uh representative uh
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
spank thank you very much
 
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
um I was on the subcommittee and
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
um it seemed to me that the conversation
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
happening on the subcommittee was
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
counter to the final recommendation
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
um I think that everybody in the
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee recognized that this was a
 
00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
serious problem
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
um there was a little bit of discussion
 
00:23:05.289 --> 00:23:05.299 align:start position:0%
about whether the way the bill actually
 
00:23:09.289 --> 00:23:09.299 align:start position:0%
uh proposed to solve the problem was the
 
00:23:12.409 --> 00:23:12.419 align:start position:0%
right approach but as we know it's not
 
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
the bill that we're talking about it's
 
00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
whether there is a problem that needs to
 
00:23:21.289 --> 00:23:21.299 align:start position:0%
be solved there was some conversation
 
00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
about how it might be better if it were
 
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
solved if a bill were put forward that
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
recommended that it'd be more of a
 
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
locally controlled thing
 
00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:33.900 align:start position:0%
so it occurred to I was surprised by the
 
00:23:36.169 --> 00:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
vote because it seemed to me that the
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
subcommittee had felt there was a
 
00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
problem had felt that there was a
 
00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
solution that could be explored
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
um and I I so I would strongly recommend
 
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:49.980 align:start position:0%
that we change the committee's
 
00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:54.419 align:start position:0%
recommendation to take on this very
 
00:23:58.610 --> 00:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
serious problem and keep working on it
 
00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.649 align:start position:0%
serious problem and keep working on it
um

00:23:59.649 --> 00:23:59.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey bolio suggested it
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
needed more study but this bill came out
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
of a very thorough two-year commission
 
00:24:12.049 --> 00:24:12.059 align:start position:0%
that studied it I don't think another
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
commission is necessary but if another
 
00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
bill is put forward where alternative
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
Solutions can be explored I think that
 
00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:24.539 align:start position:0%
that would be adequate and badly needed
 
00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:28.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.529 --> 00:24:30.539 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else on the committee
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
every representative yes yes thank you
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I would agree with
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
representative Spang I think that one of
 
00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559 align:start position:0%
the things you have to take a look at is
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
that there is a problem out there having
 
00:24:47.289 --> 00:24:47.299 align:start position:0%
been a town planner in a Lakes Community
 
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
uh you know we have serious problems
 
00:24:51.649 --> 00:24:51.659 align:start position:0%
with Shoreline septic systems there was
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
a two-year commission that addressed
 
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
this issue and studied it in depth and
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
the recommendations that they came up
 
00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
with are pretty much what you have here
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
in this bill and to study it further
 
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
really solves no problem
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe some minor amendments
 
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
to this thing to take in some of the
 
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
concerns that some of the members have
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
here would be in order but this is this
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
bill came out of a two-year study to a
 
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
direct address a problem that we here in
 
00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:18.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire spend millions of dollars
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
on both at the state and local levels we
 
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
spend a tremendous amount of money to to
 
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
keep our Waters clean
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
and if we just sit there and say we're
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
going to do nothing
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
we're not addressing the issue and we're
 
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
really letting our constituents down
 
00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
um you know New Hampshire is successful
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
because we have such a great environment
 
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
here and to just let it go we're going
 
00:25:42.529 --> 00:25:42.539 align:start position:0%
to destroy that and we're going to lose
 
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
that advantage that we have
 
00:25:46.909 --> 00:25:46.919 align:start position:0%
I think this is a bill that that really
 
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
should have further consideration and a
 
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
bill should be introduced as an
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
accession to to address this issue
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
um and I would be happy to work with any
 
00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
members of the committee that are
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
interested in furthering a bill for the
 
00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:04.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh just let me let me first decide first
 
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
see if anyone else wishes to speak does
 
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
representative Smith then representative
 
00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
all are aware that there are issues with
 
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
non-point source pollution which is in
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
many cases septic systems and we all you
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
know I don't know of anyone who doesn't
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
want our Lakes to be clean and you know
 
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
which supports tourism which supports
 
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
healthy lives there is E coli in some
 
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.330 align:start position:0%
healthy lives there is E coli in some
Lakes

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
Lakes
 
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:49.140 align:start position:0%
um that is preventing people from
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
swimming and causing a health hazard so
 
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
although I agree that this bill itself
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
as written is causing problems I do
 
00:27:00.649 --> 00:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
think there is a solution that all sides
 
00:27:03.169 --> 00:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
can agree on and so I would say future
 
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
legislation could try to bring those
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
stakeholders together to find a way to
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
get to yes and in which case
 
00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
um future legislation not the one that
 
00:27:16.669 --> 00:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
house bill 426 is definitely an order
 
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative Spang
 
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
just quickly I wanted to address the
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
concern that uh representative Harr
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
brought forward
 
00:27:30.529 --> 00:27:30.539 align:start position:0%
to the real
 
00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
and the Realtors have told us
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
after the original hearing and then
 
00:27:39.049 --> 00:27:39.059 align:start position:0%
after this hearing that they're very
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
anxious to work with us to solve this
 
00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
problem so I think that that indicates
 
00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
that probably there is a good uh
 
00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to come together with
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
the Realtors to solve the problem if we
 
00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
continue to study it
 
00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.810 align:start position:0%
continue to study it
okay

00:27:59.810 --> 00:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:28:03.169 --> 00:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:05.700 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative Vale thank you Mr chair
 
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to be voting against the um
 
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
motion to not recommend the bill and I
 
00:28:18.529 --> 00:28:18.539 align:start position:0%
just wanted to reiterate that we're very
 
00:28:21.169 --> 00:28:21.179 align:start position:0%
aware of these issues and at this point
 
00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
I think we have a an important
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility to protect clean water
 
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
and we've spent the last two years
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
finding ways to try to keep our water
 
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
safer and make it safer and this one is
 
00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
clearly indicated
 
00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.850 align:start position:0%
clearly indicated
um

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
and so we do need to stop our declining
 
00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
water come water quality
 
00:28:45.789 --> 00:28:45.799 align:start position:0%
and I do think that future legislation
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
should be addressing that thank you
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
well I just have one thing to to say I
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
want to assure people that due to the
 
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh structure of the interim study uh
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
procedures they're
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
there are minority reports are not
 
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.610 align:start position:0%
there are minority reports are not
allowed

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
so representative Smith and myself we've
 
00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
talked and we have come to an agreement
 
00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:27.020 align:start position:0%
that the any do any this uh any minority
 
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
minority thoughts on issues will be
 
00:29:33.889 --> 00:29:33.899 align:start position:0%
mentioned in any final
 
00:29:33.899 --> 00:29:35.409 align:start position:0%
mentioned in any final
report

00:29:35.409 --> 00:29:35.419 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:29:38.289 --> 00:29:38.299 align:start position:0%
just so that all
 
00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
all ideas are will be will be presented
 
00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:46.740 align:start position:0%
so uh you know it isn't that uh it's
 
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
gonna it's not gonna be just one way
 
00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
so the report but uh but only only the
 
00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
all we're going to be voting on is the
 
00:29:58.450 --> 00:29:58.460 align:start position:0%
the motion right now uh is
 
00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
representative uh Creighton
 
00:30:03.769 --> 00:30:03.779 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair just a question
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
on procedure
 
00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.470 align:start position:0%
on procedure
um

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
this vote if we say okay this bill is
 
00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:11.649 align:start position:0%
this vote if we say okay this bill is
uh

00:30:11.649 --> 00:30:11.659 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:14.039 align:start position:0%
it does the right thing in terms of
 
00:30:15.649 --> 00:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
protecting water but it does it in a
 
00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
wrong way
 
00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:19.140 align:start position:0%
and we say okay this is this bill it
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense from that perspective
 
00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
that does not preclude another bill from
 
00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:25.740 align:start position:0%
coming in saying we're going to protect
 
00:30:27.769 --> 00:30:27.779 align:start position:0%
water in a different way maybe one that
 
00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:31.140 align:start position:0%
the Realtors would have input into
 
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm just I'm trying to understand
 
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
the exact procedure
 
00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:40.740 align:start position:0%
uh in actuality in in reality
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
what we say hear and do here does not
 
00:30:48.529 --> 00:30:48.539 align:start position:0%
affect future legislation whatsoever
 
00:30:52.669 --> 00:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
uh somewhat all it is it's a I have in
 
00:30:54.289 --> 00:30:54.299 align:start position:0%
my time here
 
00:30:54.299 --> 00:30:56.389 align:start position:0%
my time here
which

00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:31:00.769 --> 00:31:00.779 align:start position:0%
is not as considerable as some but uh
 
00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:03.539 align:start position:0%
it is fairly considerable I don't
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
believe I've heard
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
ever any testimony that oh this bill was
 
00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:16.700 align:start position:0%
not uh it was not recommended for
 
00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
for future studies so you really can't
 
00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:22.740 align:start position:0%
study it now uh or if you for future
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
action so you for so we as a legend a
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
future legislature could could couldn't
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
do anything what we want we can do what
 
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
we wanted with it so uh
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
it so the actual outcome
 
00:31:41.389 --> 00:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
of the of what we
 
00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
of what we were going to going to put
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
out we're going to our of our work
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
product will probably be a
 
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
go into a file somewhere
 
00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
for reality
 
00:31:58.370 --> 00:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:03.899 align:start position:0%

get some of your guidance and help us on
 
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
making our final decision decision great
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for the record my
 
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
name is Ted deers I am the assistant
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
Water Division director for the New
 
00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
Services and it is a tremendous pleasure
 
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
to be in front of you today
 
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
um so uh as you recall from uh previous
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
testimony Des was not supportive of this
 
00:35:13.849 --> 00:35:13.859 align:start position:0%
bill largely there was some technical
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
difficulties but also the the primary
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
reason is that we are in the process of
 
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
creating the very thing that this bill
 
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
would have us do which is to create
 
00:35:26.089 --> 00:35:26.099 align:start position:0%
surface water quality standards for pfas
 
00:35:28.609 --> 00:35:28.619 align:start position:0%
compounds where we are in that process
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
which has been long and tortured I will
 
00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
assure assure you from my side
 
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
um is that we are within uh I think
 
00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:40.140 align:start position:0%
probably a week of having a draft of
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
that out on the streets a red line draft
 
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
of our 1700 rules that will include the
 
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
four pfas compounds that have mcls URL
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
become painfully familiar with that
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
those will now be included as water
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
quality standards will apply to Waters
 
00:36:02.089 --> 00:36:02.099 align:start position:0%
20 miles Upstream of surface water
 
00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:06.900 align:start position:0%
intakes so this is on its way we gave a
 
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
uh an update to our commissioner
 
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.690 align:start position:0%
uh an update to our commissioner
yesterday

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:10.700 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
we are finalizing that red line draft
 
00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:16.740 align:start position:0%
and we will be scheduling uh some
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
stakeholder meetings to occur on that
 
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
over the next month we anticipate being
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
in rule making by the beginning of the
 
00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.210 align:start position:0%
in rule making by the beginning of the
year

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:26.220 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
which would have these rules come into
 
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
effect sometime in 20 or mid first half
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
of 2023. so that is the intent
 
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
um that is where we were headed this
 
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
will go through the rulemaking process
 
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
you all will have an opportunity through
 
00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
GL car to see it again and
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
um uh you know we are looking forward to
 
00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
getting this uh in the in the can
 
00:36:53.329 --> 00:36:53.339 align:start position:0%
so um if there's any other questions
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
about that I am very happy to uh include
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
you all on that red line version uh when
 
00:37:02.569 --> 00:37:02.579 align:start position:0%
we uh when we have it out that will be a
 
00:37:04.609 --> 00:37:04.619 align:start position:0%
non uh that sort of non-formal
 
00:37:07.609 --> 00:37:07.619 align:start position:0%
rulemaking version that is a draft but
 
00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
it will be one that has been pretty well
 
00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:12.180 align:start position:0%
vetted over the past couple years
 
00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
through a variety of different
 
00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
stakeholder opportunities so
 
00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
um at this point there really shouldn't
 
00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
be any surprises
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
okay just then as a follow-up just to be
 
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
be certain you would not you would not
 
00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:28.740 align:start position:0%
have any heartburn if we did not
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
recommend this bill for future
 
00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.510 align:start position:0%
recommend this bill for future
legislation

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:37:34.849 --> 00:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question we are uh
 
00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
like I said I think that we are have
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
this well in hand uh as a department we
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
take this seriously
 
00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:42.839 align:start position:0%
um the number of bills that have been
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
recommending this is a testament to the
 
00:37:47.329 --> 00:37:47.339 align:start position:0%
seriousness by which You all take it and
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
so uh we do not think that additional
 
00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
regulation is necessary we've gotten the
 
00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:52.670 align:start position:0%
regulation is necessary we've gotten the
message

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
message
 
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
um and uh and and the product will be
 
00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.750 align:start position:0%
um and uh and and the product will be
delivered

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
delivered
 
00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
okay thank you guys any other questions
 
00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:02.780 align:start position:0%
of uh Mr dears
 
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
deers for um taking my question which is
 
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
uh one is um when will there be public
 
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.230 align:start position:0%
uh one is um when will there be public
hearings

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question
 
00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
um we anticipate a public hearing will
 
00:38:21.359 --> 00:38:22.609 align:start position:0%
um we anticipate a public hearing will
happen

00:38:22.609 --> 00:38:22.619 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:26.099 align:start position:0%
I would expect it would be in January or
 
00:38:28.609 --> 00:38:28.619 align:start position:0%
February at this point that would be
 
00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:31.619 align:start position:0%
when we first published the uh the
 
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
proposed rulemaking so we would very
 
00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
soon thereafter within probably it has
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
to be you know within
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
60 days or so I believe is the rules so
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
we would have that hearing I'm us I'm
 
00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
thinking it's going to be January maybe
 
00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
early february-ish
 
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
um and so that will occur so we will
 
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing on this but
 
00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.630 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing on this but
additionally

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
um a long-standing water quality
 
00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
standards advisory committee which has
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
some has hundreds of people who receive
 
00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:09.300 align:start position:0%
the emails on that
 
00:39:11.569 --> 00:39:11.579 align:start position:0%
um generally those folks who work in
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
your communities uh the they put people
 
00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
who run wastewater treatment plants and
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
water treatment
 
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
so um as well as their Consultants all
 
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
sit on uh you know receive those emails
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
receive that information those are
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
widely that call is widely widely
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
attended and has opportunities for
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
virtual attendance as well so we'll um
 
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
you know send an opportunity out for you
 
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
all to see that and that'll be that'll
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
be an opportunity for the experts in
 
00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:43.740 align:start position:0%
water quality and the implications of
 
00:39:46.849 --> 00:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
water quality to be able to um to let us
 
00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
know what they're thinking in an
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
informal way prior to the formal
 
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process which includes that
 
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
public hearing okay follow-up Mr chair
 
00:39:58.490 --> 00:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up so I did I hear that you
 
00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:05.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely no I I would absolutely love
 
00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
to have uh this committee um it is an
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity for you all to learn
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
um all about uh the excruciating detail
 
00:40:19.849 --> 00:40:19.859 align:start position:0%
of water quality standards uh in this
 
00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
Fair State okay and then one more
 
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
follow-up for a follow-up thank you
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
um you testified that EPA is kind of
 
00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:30.300 align:start position:0%
going in a good direction as far as
 
00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:32.900 align:start position:0%
setting uh pfas water quality standards
 
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
do you is that moving along at all I
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
would don't know that I have
 
00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
characterized it as a good direction but
 
00:40:41.569 --> 00:40:41.579 align:start position:0%
I would definitely say that they are
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
going in a direction uh so what we
 
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
anticipate happening is that we
 
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
anticipate that EPA is also going to
 
00:40:52.609 --> 00:40:52.619 align:start position:0%
start a rulemaking process on mcls that
 
00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
is for drinking water recall uh that New
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is light years ahead of many
 
00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
other states in the country on this
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
issue so these rules are really being
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
focused the the effort is being focused
 
00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
on the rest of of the nation uh where
 
00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:13.740 align:start position:0%
this hasn't gotten the attention that it
 
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
has here
 
00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:20.220 align:start position:0%
so we're not sure where that's going to
 
00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:23.220 align:start position:0%
end up we do anticipate that but if if
 
00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
we think that the state rulemaking
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
process is uh is tortured uh try try the
 
00:41:32.329 --> 00:41:32.339 align:start position:0%
federal rulemaking process so we think
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
that that will be a long effort uh
 
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
before those mcls become Rule and we
 
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
don't know what those numbers are going
 
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
to look like they have not yet released
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
those but there will be we do know that
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
that will be happening sometime around
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the year okay thank you
 
00:41:49.079 --> 00:41:50.810 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the year okay thank you
you

00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
 
00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:57.829 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
committee

00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:02.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:05.569 --> 00:42:05.579 align:start position:0%
representative Smith do you have a
 
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
motion yeah I make a motion to not
 
00:42:11.089 --> 00:42:11.099 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation uh at
 
00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
least this year anyway because DS seems
 
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
to be doing their job
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
for a second
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:25.849 --> 00:42:25.859 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion uh
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
I think we uh yes thank you Mr chair
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
um I think we all understand the
 
00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:38.220 align:start position:0%
importance of um mcls and rules getting
 
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
passed regarding surface water I know
 
00:42:44.329 --> 00:42:44.339 align:start position:0%
that um in my district Plymouth the
 
00:42:47.089 --> 00:42:47.099 align:start position:0%
water and sewer company was very upset
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
when these bills were introduced because
 
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
they just felt like things were it was
 
00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
going to be a really bad situation for
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
Plymouth so I think that allowing this
 
00:42:59.569 --> 00:42:59.579 align:start position:0%
process to play itself out and I'm
 
00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:02.339 align:start position:0%
assuming that the people from all the
 
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
different water and sewer districts are
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
going to be are in the stakeholders
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
group so I think this is a good
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
anyone else with a wish to comment on
 
00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:16.980 align:start position:0%
the bill well representative Cohen did
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your second I'm
 
00:43:20.569 --> 00:43:20.579 align:start position:0%
sorry oh yes I think uh Mr deers gave us
 
00:43:22.609 --> 00:43:22.619 align:start position:0%
an excellent excellent explanation
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
what's going on and that the intent of
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
the bill was being met and that at this
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
point we don't need legislation to put
 
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
that effort in motion it's well under
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
control right now
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
okay is there anyone else who wishes to
 
00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.890 align:start position:0%
okay is there anyone else who wishes to
speak

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:39.900 align:start position:0%

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:08.690 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
14 40 relative to surface water quality
 
00:45:16.319 --> 00:45:17.990 align:start position:0%
14 40 relative to surface water quality
standards

00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
for perfluorinated chemicals
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
don't go away
 
00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
Mr deers
 
00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh 1440 we provided testimony
 
00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:35.220 align:start position:0%
um about this bill uh we provided
 
00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:36.660 align:start position:0%
testimony that we were opposed to this
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
and largely the reasons are there are
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
technical defaults uh technical uh
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
challenges within this bill uh the way
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
that it uh addresses this especially the
 
00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
way in which things are um
 
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
added together
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
um and so and again the way that this
 
00:45:59.089 --> 00:45:59.099 align:start position:0%
will ultimately come together is through
 
00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
our water quality standards which I just
 
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
spoke about so
 
00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
the one other point I would just make is
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
that um EPA this this refers to uh one
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
of the parts of this bill is that it
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
refers to the effect of pfas on aquatic
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
organisms I will also report that EPA
 
00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
has now told us and told the states that
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
they are working on uh guidance for the
 
00:46:25.849 --> 00:46:25.859 align:start position:0%
states on setting pfas standards for
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
Critters so that is going on and will
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
progress this is an effort that will
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
eventually get published as something
 
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
called 304 a guidance three or four a
 
00:46:41.809 --> 00:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
guidance become part of what every three
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
years the state we go and look at our
 
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
water quality standards if there is new
 
00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
304 a guidance from EPA we are obligated
 
00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
to use that as part of setting our water
 
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
quality standards and if we don't want
 
00:46:58.970 --> 00:46:58.980 align:start position:0%
to use that we have to have very good
 
00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
scientific rationale for not using that
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
so it is an extraordinarily large
 
00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:08.220 align:start position:0%
project of national implication to look
 
00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:10.380 align:start position:0%
across all of this and it in New
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would never have the capacity
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
to actually do all of the science
 
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
necessary to look at what is the effect
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
of pfas on all of our aquatic organisms
 
00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
so it is important that EPA take this on
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
and as we've heard now that they intend
 
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
to over the next year or so develop
 
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
these criteria for aquatic organisms and
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
then at like I mentioned as part of our
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
federal process with EPA we would be
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
obliged to bring those into our water
 
00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:42.900 align:start position:0%
quality standards so this bill is
 
00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:44.450 align:start position:0%
quality standards so this bill is
essentially

00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
um it's saying to do what is already
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
being done uh and so we don't think that
 
00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
it needs additional regulation uh this
 
00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:53.220 align:start position:0%
is something that I think one could look
 
00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:55.079 align:start position:0%
at um you know in the next session to
 
00:47:56.930 --> 00:47:56.940 align:start position:0%
see what the progress is is happening on
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
this but this is something that is in
 
00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
the works
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions of Mr
 
00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:10.190 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions of Mr
deers

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:12.300 align:start position:0%
representative grassy
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
um yes Mr cheers I think you you
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
basically brought up one of the
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
contentions I have this you're saying
 
00:48:20.089 --> 00:48:20.099 align:start position:0%
that we could look at next session
 
00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
possibly or later on in the second year
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
but if this bill was available to you uh
 
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
in January for an amendment to maybe
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
address some of the things that are
 
00:48:31.849 --> 00:48:31.859 align:start position:0%
coming down from the federal government
 
00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:35.220 align:start position:0%
as well wouldn't there be value in that
 
00:48:37.309 --> 00:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much for the question
 
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
the the challenges is that nothing is
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
going to be sort of ready for prime time
 
00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
from the federal government in January
 
00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
we're a year out from that because even
 
00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
the mcls that they're developing will be
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
draft so those won't be adopted there
 
00:48:53.329 --> 00:48:53.339 align:start position:0%
won't be a thing yet and it's in terms
 
00:48:55.609 --> 00:48:55.619 align:start position:0%
of the 304a guidance for aquatic
 
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
creatures again we won't even see a
 
00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
draft of that for another year so
 
00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:02.420 align:start position:0%
there's really nothing
 
00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
the only thing that we would be
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
certainly I think happy to do and we
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
will be doing with the committee you're
 
00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
going to have a lot of new members in
 
00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
the committee uh next year and one of
 
00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:13.740 align:start position:0%
the things that I've recommended to the
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
chair and offered to the chair is that
 
00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:17.460 align:start position:0%
we would be happy to come in and talk
 
00:49:20.109 --> 00:49:20.119 align:start position:0%
about where all of these things sit
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
across these different efforts there's
 
00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
been a whole plethora of bills that have
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
looked at these issues there's lots of
 
00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
moving parts to this and there's lots of
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
different activities going on between
 
00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
the state government the federal
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
government great uh there's a great
 
00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:37.740 align:start position:0%
article in on HPR this morning about
 
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
about soil standards soil remediation
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
standards again there's progress being
 
00:49:44.569 --> 00:49:44.579 align:start position:0%
made across all those activities I don't
 
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
think that a bill is necessary to do
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
that but I certainly hope we'll have the
 
00:49:50.089 --> 00:49:50.099 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address the committee in
 
00:49:52.609 --> 00:49:52.619 align:start position:0%
the next session to give an update on
 
00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
representative harb would you I'll ask
 
00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:12.180 align:start position:0%
you for a motion
 
00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
based upon Our Testimony I would
 
00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
recommend not recommended for future
 
00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:21.650 align:start position:0%
recommend not recommended for future
legislation

00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
not recommended
 
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:36.609 --> 00:50:36.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:39.140 align:start position:0%
representative harb do you wish to
 
00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
speak any more on your motion
 
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:45.060 align:start position:0%
now just to reiterate based upon what we
 
00:50:47.329 --> 00:50:47.339 align:start position:0%
heard during our initial testimony and
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
hearing and what we heard today from Mr
 
00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:50.990 align:start position:0%
hearing and what we heard today from Mr
deers

00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
deers
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
um I suggest it's not ready for prime
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
time and that we just say not
 
00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation let
 
00:51:00.109 --> 00:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
the job be done thank you
 
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak on your second
 
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative grassy
 
00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
yes Mr Mr chairman after the testimony
 
00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:15.180 align:start position:0%
of Mr deers I would also recommend that
 
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
we not recommend this I have introduced
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
this as an LSR but I will be going down
 
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
and taking it out I introduced LSR just
 
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
in case there was you know the state
 
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
hadn't gone any further on this I think
 
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
we're making efficient progress on this
 
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:34.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:34.260 align:start position:0%

1452 I was built I was Bill 1452.
 
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
renaming the Department of Environmental
 
00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:19.020 align:start position:0%

and assigning the department oversight

00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
you know I'd like to hear from the yes
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
yes uh morning all for the record Mark
 
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
seeonborn assistant commissioner New
 
00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:39.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:40.450 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
Services

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:40.460 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh just uh following up on previous
 
00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.069 align:start position:0%
uh just uh following up on previous
testimony

00:53:45.069 --> 00:53:45.079 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:53:48.589 --> 00:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
uh Des the commissioner and I are very
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
much opposed to this bill despite I'm
 
00:53:54.130 --> 00:53:54.140 align:start position:0%
sure well intentioned by the sponsors
 
00:53:57.849 --> 00:53:57.859 align:start position:0%
the two elements of it the renaming
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
has a cost associated with it
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
um that is unnecessary not to mention we
 
00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
believe the current name is much more in
 
00:54:09.309 --> 00:54:09.319 align:start position:0%
the spirit of the New Hampshire approach
 
00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
to these issues versus the proposed for
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
the other element as stated previously
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
um we this is uh this is a language in
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
search of a problem that doesn't exist
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
we have all ability we need to access
 
00:54:32.329 --> 00:54:32.339 align:start position:0%
area is if we need to test we have never
 
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
had a problem
 
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
and we don't feel we need this authority
 
00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
to make sure we are doing our proper
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
regulatory responsibilities so again
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
while well-intentioned we would uh
 
00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
sincerely hope that you all would move
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
not no need for future legislation on
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:02.650 align:start position:0%
 
being

00:55:02.650 --> 00:55:02.660 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative Smith you have a motion
 
00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
um I make a motion to not recommend for
 
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:21.900 align:start position:0%
by representative Harvey bolia
 
00:55:24.349 --> 00:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
uh do you wish to speak on your motion
 
00:55:26.089 --> 00:55:26.099 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:55:29.569 --> 00:55:29.579 align:start position:0%
well of course thank you Mr chair
 
00:55:29.579 --> 00:55:31.130 align:start position:0%
well of course thank you Mr chair
um

00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:31.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
I'm not even going to speak to the name
 
00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
change because I think that we heard
 
00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
enough about that and the cost and it's
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
it's completely different than the rest
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
of the bill which is more of more
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
interest I mean I think it's really
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
important that people get their Wells
 
00:55:54.349 --> 00:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
tested but I do believe that people have
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
that option and if we were to pass
 
00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
legislation uh requiring Des to
 
00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
inspect and test private Wells we would
 
00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:07.380 align:start position:0%
be giving them policing Authority or
 
00:56:08.809 --> 00:56:08.819 align:start position:0%
they would have to call in the town
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
compliance officer every time they
 
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to do that and it's not just like
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
checking the Wellhead it's going into
 
00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:19.020 align:start position:0%
their homes to check the faucets in the
 
00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
kitchen and the bathroom and stuff so
 
00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:26.220 align:start position:0%
that's not good and also the cost of
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
doing uh wait I had some other notes
 
00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:32.460 align:start position:0%
where are they
 
00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
right now people can have their water
 
00:56:38.329 --> 00:56:38.339 align:start position:0%
tested and if they're in areas that has
 
00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:40.980 align:start position:0%
been noted for pfas I believe that in a
 
00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
lot of times that is paid for by the
 
00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:43.849 align:start position:0%
lot of times that is paid for by the
state

00:56:43.849 --> 00:56:43.859 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:56:47.329 --> 00:56:47.339 align:start position:0%
and the other thing I wanted to bring up
 
00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
is that and I think representative
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
renzullo can say more about that is that
 
00:56:55.730 --> 00:56:55.740 align:start position:0%
we did pass legislation that became law
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
to La this past session to open up the
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity for private homeowners or
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
private well owners to get grants or
 
00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:07.930 align:start position:0%
private well owners to get grants or
loans

00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:07.940 align:start position:0%
loans
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
for remediation if their water tests
 
00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
positive for pfest so I think that you
 
00:57:17.329 --> 00:57:17.339 align:start position:0%
know doing it on a voluntary basis and
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
as we heard from Des during the initial
 
00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:22.140 align:start position:0%
testimony people want to know what's in
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
their water they want to know if their
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
well is contaminated with pfas and so
 
00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:30.839 align:start position:0%
those maybe few people who do not want
 
00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:33.059 align:start position:0%
their water tested
 
00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
that's their right but otherwise most
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
people the majority of people are taking
 
00:57:41.089 --> 00:57:41.099 align:start position:0%
taking it on to have they want their
 
00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:43.140 align:start position:0%
water tested so
 
00:57:44.809 --> 00:57:44.819 align:start position:0%
so I don't think this needs future
 
00:57:44.819 --> 00:57:47.390 align:start position:0%
so I don't think this needs future
legislation

00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else wish this uh wish
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:56.690 --> 00:57:56.700 align:start position:0%
yeah I would I I would like to like to
 
00:57:59.390 --> 00:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
like to say that there is a program
 
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
going on now where homeowners can
 
00:58:07.849 --> 00:58:07.859 align:start position:0%
uh if if pfas is found in their in their
 
00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
Wells uh at a in a out of compliance
 
00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
that they the state does and will
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh offer offers you a uh basically a
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
loan and uh it's not actually it's not
 
00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
alone it's a grant and it's uh it's uh
 
00:58:30.530 --> 00:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
you know I know I'm taking advantage of
 
00:58:32.690 --> 00:58:32.700 align:start position:0%
it myself right now I was surprised to
 
00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:37.380 align:start position:0%
find recently that uh I uh my name
 
00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:39.660 align:start position:0%
neighbor who was selling this uh home
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
had to do have to have a pfest I had to
 
00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:46.140 align:start position:0%
have water testing which is normal for
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
sales and turns out
 
00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
uh he had pfas in his wealth which
 
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
nobody knew nowhere near anything any
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
other issue any other uh area where
 
00:59:02.569 --> 00:59:02.579 align:start position:0%
there's uh pfast
 
00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh so we were notified by the state
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
because we were within five was it 500
 
00:59:14.329 --> 00:59:14.339 align:start position:0%
feet of his well and my well had a uh we
 
00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
had pfas in it as well uh most most of
 
00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:20.700 align:start position:0%
it there was one that was out of out of
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
compliance and so
 
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
good uh so we had the water test tested
 
00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:32.220 align:start position:0%
and that's what it came out and
 
00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:35.940 align:start position:0%
lo and behold we found out that there
 
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
was this this program
 
00:59:43.549 --> 00:59:43.559 align:start position:0%
and I'm saying wow so uh it and other P
 
00:59:45.289 --> 00:59:45.299 align:start position:0%
I make certain I've made certain other
 
00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:48.180 align:start position:0%
people in my town I've even broadcasted
 
00:59:51.789 --> 00:59:51.799 align:start position:0%
on the uh on the uh
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
Pub on the public our public channel
 
00:59:57.410 --> 00:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
that this is available and people are
 
01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
wanting to know about it I'm getting
 
01:00:02.809 --> 01:00:02.819 align:start position:0%
uh people want people who have nowhere
 
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:05.700 align:start position:0%
near where I live I want to have their
 
01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:07.980 align:start position:0%
Wells tested so there's no there's not
 
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
there's nobody saying no we don't want
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
our well tested there are people who
 
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
want their well-tested so and should get
 
01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:17.940 align:start position:0%
it so uh you know and you're looking at
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%

01:03:02.339 --> 01:03:04.309 align:start position:0%
Water Division director at New Hampshire
Des

01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
Des
 
01:03:04.319 --> 01:03:05.589 align:start position:0%
Des
um

01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:14.460 align:start position:0%
we did we we certainly uh agree with the
 
01:03:18.049 --> 01:03:18.059 align:start position:0%
the the intent of this which is to make
 
01:03:20.809 --> 01:03:20.819 align:start position:0%
sure that people uh in daycare uh
 
01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:22.380 align:start position:0%
schools and licensed child care
 
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
facilities are are drinking good water I
 
01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:26.579 align:start position:0%
mean that's I think that that goes
 
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
without saying uh there are some major
 
01:03:33.890 --> 01:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
problems with this uh this bill and
 
01:03:35.809 --> 01:03:35.819 align:start position:0%
um this really had to do with the fact
 
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
that and this is now I I believe that
 
01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
there's actually some negotiations in
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
the work in the works on some future
 
01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
legislation that will come up that's
 
01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
already on a different track but that
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
the problem is is that most of the a lot
 
01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
of the the facilities that look at
 
01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.089 align:start position:0%
of the the facilities that look at
um

01:03:56.089 --> 01:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
uh child care and schools are on are
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
already on
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
Public Water Supplies
 
01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:07.380 align:start position:0%
so so this idea that somehow we would
 
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
the public water supply is already under
 
01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
the MCL requirements so the water that's
 
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
coming out of the Taps is already being
 
01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
tested at schools and day cares for that
 
01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
purpose so that is already going on
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
um at uh because of the programs that we
 
01:04:26.809 --> 01:04:26.819 align:start position:0%
already have
 
01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
so that really is the challenge to that
 
01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
was the primary challenge to this bill
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
um it is important to uh
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
to only test the source of the water and
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
not the the actual uh and not the actual
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
Taps and and the other issue with that
 
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
is that it's not like it's lead where
 
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's coming out of the pipes where it's
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
coming out of the the spigots so there's
 
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:55.799 align:start position:0%
really no reason to go and test actual
 
01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
you know the delivered water it's really
 
01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
um and so the other uh issue is that it
 
01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
really we should only be testing those
 
01:05:09.410 --> 01:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
facilities that do not get water from
 
01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
Public Water Supplies so and that is now
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
ongoing and I think that we reported you
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
got a report uh in uh from this from Des
 
01:05:20.329 --> 01:05:20.339 align:start position:0%
in June this committee got a sent a
 
01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
report on our testing results from
 
01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:26.220 align:start position:0%
across the state so you you I think are
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
well aware that this is already underway
 
01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:35.780 align:start position:0%
um and finally the actual regulation of
 
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
pfas or any other compound for schools
 
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
and day cares is not a des
 
01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility it's actually a DHHS
 
01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.010 align:start position:0%
responsibility it's actually a DHHS
responsibility

01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:48.839 align:start position:0%
so this bill would dramatically change
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
would have dramatically changed the
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
entire structure of how those day cares
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
and schools are being regulated for
 
01:05:59.210 --> 01:05:59.220 align:start position:0%
their Public Health not just what the
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
children are drinking but everything
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
else about the whole public school
 
01:06:06.109 --> 01:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
system and the safety of that for our
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
children is currently in the hands of
 
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
the public health officials Des is an
 
01:06:13.609 --> 01:06:13.619 align:start position:0%
environmental agency and we do some
 
01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
Public Health they are a public health
 
01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
agency and so it is much better to have
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
that there we advise DHHS on their
 
01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
practices they use the numbers that come
 
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
out of what we do but changing the
 
01:06:31.069 --> 01:06:31.079 align:start position:0%
entire structure of the way that we
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
handle public health for for our most
 
01:06:37.549 --> 01:06:37.559 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations that is a that is
 
01:06:40.849 --> 01:06:40.859 align:start position:0%
a very very big change which this bill I
 
01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
don't and the testimony to which really
 
01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
didn't take into consideration the
 
01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
enormity of of that change so there are
 
01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
efforts now afoot to be able to work on
 
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
that issue this is not going to go away
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
because it is an important issue but in
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
terms of this bill and the current
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
effort there is not a need to move this
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
forward so that's my take on it and I'm
 
01:07:07.609 --> 01:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
representative grassief yes uh Mr deers
 
01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
um if without this bill do you have the
 
01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
ability to test private schools and
 
01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
child care centers
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
representative I think that as as uh
 
01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:25.740 align:start position:0%
representative uh renzulo noted and as
 
01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
the previous testimony just noted we
 
01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
have no shortage of ability to go test
 
01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:32.990 align:start position:0%
have no shortage of ability to go test
things

01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:07:35.569 --> 01:07:35.579 align:start position:0%
um if we have if you're within 500 feet
 
01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:38.700 align:start position:0%
of a known pfas source or pfas detection
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
we go and test those Wells so there is
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
not a problem with us getting in and
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
testing uh daycares if there's a reason
 
01:07:51.049 --> 01:07:51.059 align:start position:0%
to do so so this is something that is
 
01:07:54.349 --> 01:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
ongoing and you've also seen that we've
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
tested now thousands and thousands of
 
01:07:58.079 --> 01:07:58.870 align:start position:0%
tested now thousands and thousands of
wells

01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
wells
 
01:08:01.069 --> 01:08:01.079 align:start position:0%
and we are PR those have been
 
01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
prioritized based on where where we know
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
sources and where we have detections as
 
01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
we get those detections we draw those
 
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
circles those circles you know start to
 
01:08:11.569 --> 01:08:11.579 align:start position:0%
intersect we start to have a better
 
01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
understanding of where we're headed so
 
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
um so so we will continue to be doing
 
01:08:19.610 --> 01:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
that there's no shortage of either
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
ability we have no shortage of dollars
 
01:08:24.829 --> 01:08:24.839 align:start position:0%
to do that at this point which is really
 
01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
fun to say and we uh and there's no you
 
01:08:31.729 --> 01:08:31.739 align:start position:0%
know shortage of of personnel or or or
 
01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
other desire to do that so again that's
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
going to continue on a pace I don't
 
01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
think I don't think that this is an
 
01:08:42.289 --> 01:08:42.299 align:start position:0%
issue that that is is right now uh one
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
that we need to to deal with from a
 
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.289 --> 01:08:51.299 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the democracy
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
no no question
 
01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:59.689 --> 01:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you Mr chair
 
01:08:59.699 --> 01:09:00.530 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you Mr chair
um

01:09:00.530 --> 01:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:02.630 align:start position:0%
um
when

01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
BS Bill uh the discussion of
 
01:09:10.689 --> 01:09:10.699 align:start position:0%
requiring Des to inspect private Wells
 
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
our homes with private Wells
 
01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:17.510 align:start position:0%
our homes with private Wells
um

01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
I thought that we need you needed
 
01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:22.329 align:start position:0%
I thought that we need you needed
um

01:09:22.329 --> 01:09:22.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
policing authority to to do that testing
 
01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
if people
 
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
hadn't asked for it is it different for
 
01:09:34.729 --> 01:09:34.739 align:start position:0%
private schools
 
01:09:36.349 --> 01:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
um because we don't regulate all the
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
private school public health stuff I'm
 
01:09:43.249 --> 01:09:43.259 align:start position:0%
not sure that no the precise answer but
 
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding is is that DHHS has the
 
01:09:48.769 --> 01:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
authority to require any kind of testing
 
01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
that is needed for those those
 
01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
um you know day care and and uh in
 
01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
schools you know I think this is really
 
01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:00.260 align:start position:0%
important question because
 
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
oftentimes that you know a daycare can
 
01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:04.140 align:start position:0%
be everything from the Boys and Girls
 
01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:05.390 align:start position:0%
be everything from the Boys and Girls
Club

01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
Club
 
01:10:09.229 --> 01:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
to you know uh basically an in-home uh
 
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
daycare system so it's really important
 
01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
that that DHHS is the one who tracks all
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
of that otherwise we were just we would
 
01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
be in the realm of just somebody's
 
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
private well so there is in fact a whole
 
01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
regulatory structure for those in fact
 
01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
um just personally my son was a private
 
01:10:32.689 --> 01:10:32.699 align:start position:0%
school teacher a daycare teacher a big
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
six foot one Burly guy with a beard who
 
01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
was taking care of the babies uh the
 
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
baby section
 
01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
um so anyway he was it was pretty funny
 
01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:45.980 align:start position:0%
but um they were visited very frequently
 
01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
by DHHS and by other agencies to look at
 
01:10:53.689 --> 01:10:53.699 align:start position:0%
their facilities and we're very
 
01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:56.460 align:start position:0%
constantly under supervision from those
 
01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:57.950 align:start position:0%
constantly under supervision from those
agencies

01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:10:59.570 --> 01:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:02.169 align:start position:0%
thank you
Chris

01:11:02.169 --> 01:11:02.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
representative uh yeah now you basically
 
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
what you said was here is that they get
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
inspected by DHHS and I'm quite familiar
 
01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
with that my wife having run daycares in
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
his child care centers for if I say
 
01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
daycare since she gets mad at me but
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
child care centers for a number of years
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
and still still doing that as well but
 
01:11:23.209 --> 01:11:23.219 align:start position:0%
DHHS doesn't test their water and I'm
 
01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
not aware of any requirement that they
 
01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
would be in testing their water for that
 
01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:29.460 align:start position:0%
should this bill maybe be amended to
 
01:11:32.570 --> 01:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
direct instead of having Des do the work
 
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
having DHHS do the work
 
01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:37.250 align:start position:0%
having DHHS do the work
instead

01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
instead
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
um because you know so that it's in part
 
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
of what's included in their requirements
 
01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
for licensing
 
01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
um I understand the the complications I
 
01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't want to take the
 
01:11:48.050 --> 01:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
public health issues out for other
 
01:11:49.610 --> 01:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
issues that they do but getting into
 
01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
water quality isn't something that DHHS
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
has the expertise at doing but maybe
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
this bill could be utilized to to take
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
so so
 
01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:01.669 align:start position:0%
so so
um

01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that there's a
 
01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
representative from DHHS here behind me
 
01:12:09.490 --> 01:12:09.500 align:start position:0%
so I I Hazard to speak on their behalf
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
what I would just say is that I think
 
01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
what you've noted is that this probably
 
01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a Department of
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services responsibility I
 
01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
also understand
 
01:12:21.169 --> 01:12:21.179 align:start position:0%
because I know that we're actually
 
01:12:23.810 --> 01:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
writing a fiscal note right now for an
 
01:12:27.709 --> 01:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
LSR that there is an LSR on this already
 
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
so I know that there's already work
 
01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
going on and that's one of the key
 
01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
pieces of that um of the LSR that I know
 
01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
that we've already received the request
 
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
for a physical note for so my suggestion
 
01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
is is that
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
um we're that this is already well
 
01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:49.130 align:start position:0%
 
there

01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:49.140 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:12:52.810 --> 01:12:52.820 align:start position:0%
I was under the impression and this that
 
01:12:56.410 --> 01:12:56.420 align:start position:0%
if uh that that
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
daycares had to have their water tested
 
01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:04.140 align:start position:0%
at a periodic basis and if not that was
 
01:13:07.130 --> 01:13:07.140 align:start position:0%
if they did not do that that that had to
 
01:13:10.490 --> 01:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
be it is that had to be uh they had to
 
01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
notify their uh clients or their
 
01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
customers that that fact is that
 
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
again I don't have a wealth of
 
01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
experience in the that that part of it
 
01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:25.980 align:start position:0%
so maybe potentially representative
 
01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
grassy knows the answer to that but I
 
01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
can certainly find that out and get that
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
to you it was my assumption that
 
01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:35.470 align:start position:0%
to you it was my assumption that
um

01:13:35.470 --> 01:13:35.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:43.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
well let me just look at my notes Here
 
01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
so the department this is what I had
 
01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
from our notes and what we testified on
 
01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
last year over the course of this
 
01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
session is that DHHS is actually working
 
01:14:18.890 --> 01:14:18.900 align:start position:0%
on this right now this is something
 
01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
that's where I think the nature of the
 
01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
of the the the the the fiscal note that
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
I just mentioned to you is that there
 
01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
are already
 
01:14:29.410 --> 01:14:29.420 align:start position:0%
um uh there are already
 
01:14:31.729 --> 01:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
resources and being put towards this
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if I may just address that
 
01:14:38.689 --> 01:14:38.699 align:start position:0%
as well I know that they we have been
 
01:14:41.450 --> 01:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
doing they are doing lead testing and
 
01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
that's been something that that the
 
01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services has
 
01:14:45.229 --> 01:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
been doing but that is the only
 
01:14:46.669 --> 01:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
requirement that I'm aware of that they
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
actually go out and test at the waters
 
01:14:51.050 --> 01:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
when we pass the bill for lead testing
 
01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
and there were a lot of I got a lot of
 
01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:54.900 align:start position:0%
complaints from My Wife and others that
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
are involved in the and because it's
 
01:14:58.250 --> 01:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
just an additional requirement they have
 
01:14:59.810 --> 01:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
but they they have been doing that for
 
01:15:14.450 --> 01:15:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:16.370 --> 01:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
 
01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:18.890 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
committee

01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none of Representative grassy are
 
01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:25.140 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
looking you you would like to have is it
 
01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
your uh contention that you would like
 
01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:32.030 align:start position:0%
your uh contention that you would like
to

01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:34.090 align:start position:0%
to
uh

01:15:34.090 --> 01:15:34.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:36.890 --> 01:15:36.900 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I I would like to see this
 
01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
bill uh recommended for further
 
01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
legislation and what uh I think that
 
01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
there is a problem that exists out there
 
01:15:44.209 --> 01:15:44.219 align:start position:0%
and it's something that we shouldn't
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
address uh the form that I think uh Mr
 
01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
deers had said is that there's another
 
01:15:51.410 --> 01:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
bill out there someplace and I think
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
that this would just be in support of
 
01:15:54.890 --> 01:15:54.900 align:start position:0%
that if if need be
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
um I know I have resubmitted the LSR and
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
I think that there are certainly some
 
01:16:01.850 --> 01:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
changes which uh Mr deers has
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
recommended that I will be looking at
 
01:16:06.050 --> 01:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
introducing into that bill
 
01:16:09.050 --> 01:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
um so I I would certainly recommend uh
 
01:16:14.030 --> 01:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
further uh further legislation
 
01:16:18.770 --> 01:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
yeah that that puts you know puts us in
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
an interesting
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
conundrum in that
 
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
recommending a bill that we would have
 
01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
no the the
 
01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:33.530 align:start position:0%
no the the
uh

01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
the subject of which would we would have
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
no uh interest in
 
01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
other words we'd be strictly a DHHS
 
01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:43.310 align:start position:0%
other words we'd be strictly a DHHS
issue

01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:45.649 align:start position:0%
issue
uh

01:16:45.649 --> 01:16:45.659 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
nice ex
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative Smith yeah well Mr chair
 
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
anything involving pfas and clean water
 
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh should be of interest to the
 
01:16:58.490 --> 01:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
committee whether or not the bill comes
 
01:17:02.209 --> 01:17:02.219 align:start position:0%
to us or not that would be my thoughts
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's just what I really meant decisions
 
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
to say was that the the our function
 
01:17:15.169 --> 01:17:15.179 align:start position:0%
would uh does not would such that it
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
would not be something that we would be
 
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
taking a uh
 
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:23.820 align:start position:0%
an interest or a
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
or our function was does not require us
 
01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:29.570 align:start position:0%
or our function was does not require us
to

01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh legis to examine that legislation
 
01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
so uh so we would be we would be uh if
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
we went ahead and recommended future
 
01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
legislation we would be recommending it
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
for somebody else
 
01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
uh if we
 
01:17:53.570 --> 01:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
uh that so it's one that I've never
 
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
faced this is a somebody must have faced
 
01:17:59.450 --> 01:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
this before some committee but uh we
 
01:18:01.850 --> 01:18:01.860 align:start position:0%
haven't I'm just throwing it out for uh
 
01:18:04.669 --> 01:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
discussion uh represent representative
 
01:18:07.370 --> 01:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
grassy yeah Mr chairman I think that you
 
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
know one of the things is the corundum
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
that we have here is that we never know
 
01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
where the bill is going to go I mean
 
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
we've gotten some strange bills here
 
01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:15.659 align:start position:0%
that we said why are they here and it's
 
01:18:17.209 --> 01:18:17.219 align:start position:0%
up to leadership to where they send
 
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
particular bills I mean this could be a
 
01:18:22.370 --> 01:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
pfas bill and if it is a dealing bill
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
with pfas and testing of water quality
 
01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
in child care centers and schools
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
private schools that it certainly could
 
01:18:32.410 --> 01:18:32.420 align:start position:0%
be a bill that came here but then again
 
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
it could be a bill that goes to another
 
01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
committee for some reason it could end
 
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
up in education it was a major bill that
 
01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
we had this last year uh dealing with
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
lead testing that ended up in education
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
and it was uh you know interesting thing
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
but we talked about it and uh and we
 
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
ended up talking about it in our
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
community here at the end of the year
 
01:18:52.850 --> 01:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
but you never know where these bills are
 
01:18:55.010 --> 01:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
going to go and I so I think that us
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
making a recommendation wherever that
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
bill happens to show up it shows that
 
01:19:01.790 --> 01:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
this committee is supportive of
 
01:19:07.490 --> 01:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh any other discussion on this on this
 
01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:16.970 align:start position:0%
uh any other discussion on this on this
bill

01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chairman yes I'd have to speak
 
01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:21.550 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chairman yes I'd have to speak
against

01:19:21.550 --> 01:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
recommending future legislation based
 
01:19:25.850 --> 01:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
upon what we've heard and the fact that
 
01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:28.860 align:start position:0%
this is a two-part Bill about renaming
 
01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
and the other part of wrong Bill no it's
 
01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:33.729 align:start position:0%
and the other part of wrong Bill no it's
not

01:19:33.729 --> 01:19:33.739 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:36.300 align:start position:0%
can we skip that one
 
01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
no it's
 
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
we voted we voted that we already killed
 
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
that one well based upon what Mr deer
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
says I I don't think it really should be
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
um recommended since there are already
 
01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
other legislation pending and fiscal
 
01:19:52.610 --> 01:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
notes being written uh I would not
 
01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
support uh recommendation for future
 
01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:59.209 align:start position:0%
support uh recommendation for future
legislation

01:19:59.209 --> 01:19:59.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
do anyone else wish this uh is
 
01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
is is that emotion
 
01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
do you make are you just speaking to
 
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
that or is that emotion
 
01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
I wasn't sure if we had a motion no
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:20:19.130 --> 01:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
so I'll make my Roshan my motion not to
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
recommend future legislation for this
 
01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:28.370 --> 01:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
is there a seconds in a motion
 
01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
and you've already really you've already
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
spoken on your motion I haven't no need
 
01:20:40.370 --> 01:20:40.380 align:start position:0%

all right uh it's just going moving on
 
01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
adding several
 
01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:38.930 align:start position:0%
adding several
well

01:22:38.930 --> 01:22:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
adding several perfluorinated chemicals
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
to the list of per and polyfluoroalkyl
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
substances with maximum contaminant
 
01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
levels and establishes a cumulative
 
01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
total for the maximum contaminant level
 
01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
of per and
 
01:23:02.209 --> 01:23:02.219 align:start position:0%
polyfluoro alkyl substances Mr deers
 
01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh Mr chair the um
 
01:23:07.729 --> 01:23:07.739 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:23:07.739 --> 01:23:08.270 align:start position:0%
the department
um

01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
was uh was not supportive of this bill
 
01:23:13.970 --> 01:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons uh some of
 
01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
which are very technical
 
01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
um the fact that this adds two chemicals
 
01:23:23.709 --> 01:23:23.719 align:start position:0%
one is pfba and one is pfbs
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
the problem with this is that the number
 
01:23:31.010 --> 01:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
that was recommended for pfba is several
 
01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:33.719 align:start position:0%
at least two orders of magnitude lower
 
01:23:37.850 --> 01:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
than what the toxological uh in uh the
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
toxicological evidence would suggest it
 
01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
should be so that seems to fly in the
 
01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
face of making good science-informed
 
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
public policy secondly for pfbs the
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
number is very high which is probably
 
01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
means that um there's going to be if
 
01:23:58.490 --> 01:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
there if we would ever find this it
 
01:23:59.870 --> 01:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
would already there would be some other
 
01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
pfas compound that would be so much
 
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
lower that this would be irrelevant so
 
01:24:07.010 --> 01:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
that one again is one that we don't have
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
also very much toxological evidence for
 
01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
it all and so we would be making a
 
01:24:13.790 --> 01:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
number which is at this point
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
essentially a screening number which is
 
01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
really not what mcls are supposed to be
 
01:24:19.610 --> 01:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
these are all things that are being
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
looked at by EPA as part of its current
 
01:24:24.169 --> 01:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
science effort and so we'll get informed
 
01:24:25.250 --> 01:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
by that
 
01:24:27.169 --> 01:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
the final thing and we've testified on
 
01:24:28.850 --> 01:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
this many times is the department is
 
01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
very uncomfortable with setting a
 
01:24:33.169 --> 01:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
combined pfas limit
 
01:24:35.450 --> 01:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
and while at the face of it it sounds
 
01:24:37.490 --> 01:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
reasonable the problem is is that each
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
of these different pfas compounds for
 
01:24:42.649 --> 01:24:42.659 align:start position:0%
which we have mcls have different kinds
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
of toxological effects so some affect
 
01:24:47.330 --> 01:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
one part of the system of your of your
 
01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
body others affect other parts of your
 
01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
system adding them to together is not
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
really understanding the toxicity by
 
01:24:57.709 --> 01:24:57.719 align:start position:0%
which they're actually looking at how
 
01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
they affect the human body and so we
 
01:25:01.850 --> 01:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
think that this again flies in the face
 
01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
of having uh I think a very good science
 
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
informed public policy for these
 
01:25:09.239 --> 01:25:10.490 align:start position:0%
informed public policy for these
compounds

01:25:10.490 --> 01:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
compounds
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
and this is something in particular that
 
01:25:14.630 --> 01:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
the science the National Science Academy
 
01:25:17.209 --> 01:25:17.219 align:start position:0%
is looking at and we will see additional
 
01:25:20.689 --> 01:25:20.699 align:start position:0%
reports based on the combined uh effect
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
of pfas compounds in the next reports
 
01:25:26.810 --> 01:25:26.820 align:start position:0%
that are released when MCL when EPA
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
releases its draft mcls so all of that
 
01:25:31.729 --> 01:25:31.739 align:start position:0%
is going to be happening all that's
 
01:25:33.290 --> 01:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
going to be coming out we'll see some
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
better information the department is
 
01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
certainly open to any of that
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
information as it makes recommendations
 
01:25:42.169 --> 01:25:42.179 align:start position:0%
to the future of how we're going to
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.709 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
committee

01:25:51.709 --> 01:25:51.719 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:25:53.870 --> 01:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
01:25:56.330 --> 01:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and
 
01:25:58.970 --> 01:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
so dears for taking my question and this
 
01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
does not talk about well my question is
 
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
not about this bill in particular but I
 
01:26:06.290 --> 01:26:06.300 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify
 
01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
um the bill that set the MC the law that
 
01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
may set the mcl's uh for the force pfas
 
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
substances did that bill also author or
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
was there another bill that authorized
 
01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
Des to uh or mandated whatever the word
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
would be to set mcls for things that
 
01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
science came out and said were dangerous
 
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
to health
 
01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
you know to to if they found other
 
01:26:39.770 --> 01:26:39.780 align:start position:0%
prefast substances that were a problem
 
01:26:41.689 --> 01:26:41.699 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that you would be
 
01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
charged with setting levels for them or
 
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
doing the research on that with the
 
01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:48.169 align:start position:0%
doing the research on that with the
toxicologists

01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:48.179 align:start position:0%
toxicologists
 
01:26:50.209 --> 01:26:50.219 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question the one of
 
01:26:51.709 --> 01:26:51.719 align:start position:0%
the things that's a requirement is that
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
we are we are doing periodic reports to
 
01:26:58.370 --> 01:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
the legislature on pfas issue and that
 
01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
is one of the things that we look at all
 
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
the time so as new research is coming
 
01:27:06.649 --> 01:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
out our state our toxicologists
 
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
um uh John patalia who I believe has
 
01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
been in front of this committee uh
 
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
previously he is always in contact with
 
01:27:17.689 --> 01:27:17.699 align:start position:0%
uh both a regional group as well as
 
01:27:20.570 --> 01:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
National groups that are looking at the
 
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
science as it emerges so as we learn
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
about these compounds for example Gen X
 
01:27:28.669 --> 01:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
is under there's a significant amount of
 
01:27:30.610 --> 01:27:30.620 align:start position:0%
research going on about that
 
01:27:34.129 --> 01:27:34.139 align:start position:0%
and so as those compounds are understood
 
01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
better as we have the the scientific
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
rationale to back those up we will be
 
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
making recommendations for future mcls
 
01:27:46.010 --> 01:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
there are thousands of pfas compounds we
 
01:27:49.250 --> 01:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
know a bit about a half dozen or or
 
01:27:51.890 --> 01:27:51.900 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe 20 or 30 that we know
 
01:27:53.290 --> 01:27:53.300 align:start position:0%
something about
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
understanding The Chronic these are
 
01:27:57.290 --> 01:27:57.300 align:start position:0%
generally chronic
 
01:28:00.050 --> 01:28:00.060 align:start position:0%
effects they're not acute effects that
 
01:28:03.229 --> 01:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
makes it very very hard to study so to
 
01:28:06.050 --> 01:28:06.060 align:start position:0%
the extent that we have other biological
 
01:28:09.229 --> 01:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
models that are looking at these
 
01:28:10.490 --> 01:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
um they're you know looking at the
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
effects on different
 
01:28:15.169 --> 01:28:15.179 align:start position:0%
um species and the how those can
 
01:28:17.090 --> 01:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
actually be then ramped up to the human
 
01:28:20.209 --> 01:28:20.219 align:start position:0%
effects is work that is is still ongoing
 
01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
and we'll see a lot more of that this is
 
01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of funding going on to pfas
 
01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
science right now so I expect that we'll
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
see that more of that but the answer is
 
01:28:32.570 --> 01:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
yes we are required under various
 
01:28:33.890 --> 01:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
different pieces of legislation in the
 
01:28:35.930 --> 01:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
past to report back to the legislature
 
01:28:38.450 --> 01:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
on what's going on in the the world of
 
01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:45.010 align:start position:0%
on what's going on in the the world of
pfas

01:28:45.010 --> 01:28:45.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
 
01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:53.169 align:start position:0%

committee

01:28:53.169 --> 01:28:53.179 align:start position:0%

get represents the deer is out of here
 
01:31:03.410 --> 01:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible as he can uh how's
 
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
Bill 16 20. you know uh I'm going to
 
01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
speak on that identifying part of the
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
Merrimack River as a protected River
 
01:31:14.689 --> 01:31:14.699 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to that
 
01:31:16.370 --> 01:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the opportunity
 
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
to speak on this bill
 
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
um this is 1620 this would have added
 
01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
the middle section of the Merrimack
 
01:31:26.090 --> 01:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
River by uh by statutory
 
01:31:29.570 --> 01:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
um uh vote rather than going through the
 
01:31:32.930 --> 01:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
actual nominations process that is laid
 
01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
out in statute so uh the department
 
01:31:38.810 --> 01:31:38.820 align:start position:0%
suggested that maybe that we had a
 
01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
process in place for this to happen and
 
01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
if the good folks uh through Manchester
 
01:31:45.050 --> 01:31:45.060 align:start position:0%
wished to go through that um that that
 
01:31:47.570 --> 01:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
was afforded to them and that there are
 
01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
reasons and I think you heard testimony
 
01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
here by many people that there were real
 
01:31:53.629 --> 01:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
good reasons for going through that
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
process to vet all the different uh
 
01:31:58.490 --> 01:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
people who might be affected by it and
 
01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
allow them a voice in that process and
 
01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
that is essentially both a local state
 
01:32:05.930 --> 01:32:05.940 align:start position:0%
and both a local and state process that
 
01:32:07.490 --> 01:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
includes both the department and
 
01:32:09.649 --> 01:32:09.659 align:start position:0%
ultimately this committee and the
 
01:32:12.649 --> 01:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
legislature so that approach
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
um when we heard that the community
 
01:32:17.570 --> 01:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
entities themselves while they weren't
 
01:32:20.090 --> 01:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
necessarily opposed to the idea they had
 
01:32:21.649 --> 01:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
not gone through this process they
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
haven't had the ability to hear from
 
01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
their stakeholders either and so the
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
idea was is that if people really do
 
01:32:29.209 --> 01:32:29.219 align:start position:0%
want to go through that on the middle
 
01:32:32.689 --> 01:32:32.699 align:start position:0%
part of the the Merrimack that there
 
01:32:34.669 --> 01:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
should be an approach to do so that
 
01:32:37.850 --> 01:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
followed the normal statutory process
 
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
that said there were also elements of
 
01:32:45.530 --> 01:32:45.540 align:start position:0%
the statute as it was approved in 1990
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
um that how were potentially problematic
 
01:32:51.890 --> 01:32:51.900 align:start position:0%
today so while the department and I
 
01:32:53.390 --> 01:32:53.400 align:start position:0%
think many people testified that we
 
01:32:55.790 --> 01:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
should keep the designations of the
 
01:32:58.010 --> 01:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
Merrimack the way that they are there
 
01:33:00.610 --> 01:33:00.620 align:start position:0%
was some language in the existing law
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
that talked about limiting withdrawals
 
01:33:06.890 --> 01:33:06.900 align:start position:0%
for pennichuck water works as well as
 
01:33:08.689 --> 01:33:08.699 align:start position:0%
some other language that was put in
 
01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
which is really sort of archaic
 
01:33:14.810 --> 01:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
um it today if in 1990 when people were
 
01:33:16.370 --> 01:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
thinking about this was a brand new
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
program that was brought forth by some
 
01:33:23.570 --> 01:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
Extraordinary People to build a a
 
01:33:25.970 --> 01:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
program that says hey if communities
 
01:33:27.770 --> 01:33:27.780 align:start position:0%
really think that they have a special
 
01:33:29.810 --> 01:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
resource there should be additional
 
01:33:32.830 --> 01:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
additional protections additional
 
01:33:35.209 --> 01:33:35.219 align:start position:0%
opportunities to protect that River in
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
the future and we have 19 rivers that
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
have gone through through that process
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
and so these designated Rivers have that
 
01:33:44.270 --> 01:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
ability but at the time in 1990 there
 
01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
was a great deal of fear about what this
 
01:33:48.410 --> 01:33:48.420 align:start position:0%
would do to Future development about
 
01:33:50.689 --> 01:33:50.699 align:start position:0%
what this would do to other aspects
 
01:33:50.699 --> 01:33:52.310 align:start position:0%
what this would do to other aspects
including

01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
including
 
01:33:54.169 --> 01:33:54.179 align:start position:0%
um you know sort of water withdrawals
 
01:33:55.610 --> 01:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
for drinking water that we would you
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
know be drying up the Merrimack River
 
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
we now today fast forward you know 30
 
01:34:05.930 --> 01:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
years we have great programs in place to
 
01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:08.219 align:start position:0%
protect water quality we've gone through
 
01:34:10.129 --> 01:34:10.139 align:start position:0%
30 years of this program that's been
 
01:34:11.930 --> 01:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
highly successful people believe that
 
01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
they have a voice that no one is sort of
 
01:34:17.090 --> 01:34:17.100 align:start position:0%
trying to do something that is untoward
 
01:34:19.129 --> 01:34:19.139 align:start position:0%
to the communities that sit around these
 
01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
Rivers so we think that there's an
 
01:34:24.530 --> 01:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
opportunity here to remove some of that
 
01:34:27.169 --> 01:34:27.179 align:start position:0%
archaic language to
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
um and and the primary reason for that
 
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
is really about comes back to the pfas
 
01:34:34.330 --> 01:34:34.340 align:start position:0%
issue that we've just been talking about
 
01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
and Water Supplies in the southern part
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
this is really critically important time
 
01:34:42.770 --> 01:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
right now because of the loss of Water
 
01:34:45.050 --> 01:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
Supplies to pfas and because of the
 
01:34:47.330 --> 01:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
general pressure on the southern part of
 
01:34:50.689 --> 01:34:50.699 align:start position:0%
the state places like Salomon and and
 
01:34:54.770 --> 01:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
plastow and Windham and Atkinson and
 
01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
Hampstead places which we would refer to
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
as having unfortunate geology those
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
places that don't have enough water to
 
01:35:04.010 --> 01:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
support the the really important
 
01:35:05.450 --> 01:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
development that occurs in the southern
 
01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
part of our state
 
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
it's important to build the flexibility
 
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
into that moving forward so we would
 
01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:11.990 align:start position:0%
into that moving forward so we would
suggest

01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
01:35:14.090 --> 01:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
um that potentially this might be a bill
 
01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
that you might want to recommend to move
 
01:35:19.129 --> 01:35:19.139 align:start position:0%
forward for future legislation not to
 
01:35:21.050 --> 01:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
address the middle part of the Merrimack
 
01:35:23.629 --> 01:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
and its designation as a designated
 
01:35:27.169 --> 01:35:27.179 align:start position:0%
River but rather to address the language
 
01:35:29.930 --> 01:35:29.940 align:start position:0%
uh in the in the existing language in
 
01:35:32.030 --> 01:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
the bill and potentially remove that
 
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
language so that there's a lot more
 
01:35:36.709 --> 01:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
flexibility related to dealing with
 
01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
future water supply problems in the
 
01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state
 
01:35:42.530 --> 01:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
that's all I got to say about that as
 
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
Forrest Gump would say
 
01:35:48.169 --> 01:35:48.179 align:start position:0%
anyone wish to ask a question
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you Mr chair
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr deers for taking my
 
01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:53.870 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr deers for taking my
question

01:35:53.870 --> 01:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
um you refer to the different uh cities
 
01:35:58.490 --> 01:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
and towns such as Salem Hampstead
 
01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
Wyndham and I am aware that uh through
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
the drinking and groundwater trust fund
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
when I served on that we
 
01:36:07.679 --> 01:36:09.350 align:start position:0%
when I served on that we
um

01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
there was an agreement made that they
 
01:36:14.930 --> 01:36:14.940 align:start position:0%
those towns would get well either have
 
01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
build new wells or get water from the
 
01:36:21.129 --> 01:36:21.139 align:start position:0%
pennichuck water work works I believe
 
01:36:24.350 --> 01:36:24.360 align:start position:0%
and so has that been affected by this
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
statue that is archaic
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
is that is that prevented that from
 
01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:32.390 align:start position:0%
is that is that prevented that from
happening

01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question the
 
01:36:36.110 --> 01:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
answer is not yet
 
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
okay so the answer is that as we look to
 
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
this and and there are currently
 
01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
discussions afoot to talk about bringing
 
01:36:46.610 --> 01:36:46.620 align:start position:0%
additional pipes under the Merrimack
 
01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:47.750 align:start position:0%
additional pipes under the Merrimack
River

01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
River
 
01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
um and looking at those service areas
 
01:36:51.229 --> 01:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
and who's going to service which Which
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
towns in the future you know where the
 
01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
different franchise areas and all of
 
01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:55.850 align:start position:0%
different franchise areas and all of
that

01:36:55.850 --> 01:36:55.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
if you ask pennichuck today and I think
 
01:37:01.129 --> 01:37:01.139 align:start position:0%
Don Ware or maybe it was um uh Boyd
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
Smith uh talked about this during the
 
01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
the testimony on this particular bill
 
01:37:08.209 --> 01:37:08.219 align:start position:0%
they have not yet run up against that
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
that problem
 
01:37:13.729 --> 01:37:13.739 align:start position:0%
but they may in the future and so that
 
01:37:15.649 --> 01:37:15.659 align:start position:0%
is the reason why um this been
 
01:37:18.169 --> 01:37:18.179 align:start position:0%
recommended both by uh the Water
 
01:37:20.450 --> 01:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
suppliers as well as by other folks
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
who've been involved that we go ahead
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
and take care of that uh before we
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
actually get to a point where there's a
 
01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:30.470 align:start position:0%
actually get to a point where there's a
problem

01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
we this bill as written which focuses
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
specifically on a section of the
 
01:37:53.209 --> 01:37:53.219 align:start position:0%
Merrimack River real uh
 
01:37:53.219 --> 01:37:54.350 align:start position:0%
Merrimack River real uh
is

01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:37:56.930 --> 01:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
not ready for prime time and
 
01:37:58.910 --> 01:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
the way it was put together it should be
 
01:38:02.450 --> 01:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
it would it would not be recommended
 
01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:04.129 align:start position:0%
it would it would not be recommended
uh

01:38:04.129 --> 01:38:04.139 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
my concern is that the chain the what
 
01:38:10.990 --> 01:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:16.510 --> 01:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
why why does it need to be in
 
01:38:19.550 --> 01:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
what what value is it putting it in
 
01:38:22.189 --> 01:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
putting this requests or changing
 
01:38:22.199 --> 01:38:23.750 align:start position:0%
putting this requests or changing
changing

01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
changing
 
01:38:26.510 --> 01:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
what you're wanting to put what you want
 
01:38:30.110 --> 01:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
into this uh into this
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
interim study how does that affect
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
you're getting
 
01:38:37.610 --> 01:38:37.620 align:start position:0%
what you want is which one is a bill
 
01:38:39.790 --> 01:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
well just ask me
 
01:38:44.689 --> 01:38:44.699 align:start position:0%
or ask somebody else on here that's
 
01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
that was in fact going to be my response
 
01:38:49.129 --> 01:38:49.139 align:start position:0%
to you is that um I don't think it's
 
01:38:51.649 --> 01:38:51.659 align:start position:0%
necessary to use the same structure of
 
01:38:54.290 --> 01:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
this bill to move this issue forward
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
um and if there's anyone amongst you who
 
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
would like to uh create an LSR I have
 
01:39:02.510 --> 01:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
some language in my back pocket that I
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
would be happy to give you
 
01:39:06.649 --> 01:39:06.659 align:start position:0%
it says
 
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
someone wish to do that
 
01:39:12.649 --> 01:39:12.659 align:start position:0%
um no I well you know you'd volunteer
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
for him but uh I mean
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
01:39:26.570 --> 01:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh there's there will be somebody on
 
01:39:31.310 --> 01:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
this committee who will will be
 
01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:32.270 align:start position:0%
this committee who will will be
available

01:39:32.270 --> 01:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:39:34.970 --> 01:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that and so um again I will
 
01:39:36.530 --> 01:39:36.540 align:start position:0%
I will suggest that we have language
 
01:39:38.930 --> 01:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
that we've uh that we have prepared and
 
01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to send it to anybody who's
 
01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
interested so um I I will at the
 
01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
at the at the at the permission of the
 
01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:47.639 align:start position:0%
chair I'd be happy to send it to the
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole if you'd like yes
 
01:39:53.689 --> 01:39:53.699 align:start position:0%
uh why don't you and do that and
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%

I'll just add it to my list of 10 10 000
 
01:40:07.070 --> 01:40:07.080 align:start position:0%

01:40:19.010 --> 01:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%

1620
 
01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:49.970 align:start position:0%
1620
uh

01:40:49.970 --> 01:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
represent representative Smith for a
 
01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
motion no I'm not making a motion I'm
 
01:40:57.290 --> 01:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
making a company oh okay
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
definitely I was thinking uh that
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
we would recommend for future
 
01:41:07.729 --> 01:41:07.739 align:start position:0%
legislation and sub and put in uh the uh
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
LSR or you know the recommend the
 
01:41:13.490 --> 01:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
legislation that uh Mr deers is
 
01:41:15.890 --> 01:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
recommending but
 
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
um upon real you know I am really
 
01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
concerned that if we vote to have future
 
01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:23.990 align:start position:0%
concerned that if we vote to have future
legislation

01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:41:27.110 --> 01:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
um it will open up it will make people
 
01:41:29.330 --> 01:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
start thinking about changing the
 
01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
process of designating any River as a
 
01:41:34.430 --> 01:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
protected River and I really do not want
 
01:41:37.370 --> 01:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
that to change the process to change I
 
01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
think it has worked well so um whoever
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
makes a motion for not recommend I would
 
01:41:49.070 --> 01:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:51.229 --> 01:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
does anyone wish to make a motion
 
01:41:52.970 --> 01:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
or your question

the committee report
 
01:44:12.890 --> 01:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair we did have a
 
01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:15.719 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this uh representative
 
01:44:17.570 --> 01:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
Healy supported local control
 
01:44:20.510 --> 01:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey bolia spoke about
 
01:44:22.910 --> 01:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
the Dover pilot program representative
 
01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
Spang supported local control and spoke
 
01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
about a few difficulties with the bill
 
01:44:31.250 --> 01:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
as written representative gottlene
 
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
supported the concept and I supported
 
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
future discussion regarding nitrogen and
 
01:44:39.770 --> 01:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
Logan control the vote of the
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
subcommittee was 5-0 recommend for
 
01:44:45.950 --> 01:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
future legislation and I make that
 
01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:49.370 align:start position:0%
future legislation and I make that
motion

01:44:49.370 --> 01:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
01:44:55.390 --> 01:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the motion after I
 
01:44:57.770 --> 01:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
recognize you for the most I recognize
 
01:44:59.930 --> 01:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
you for the motion after I SP uh we hear
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
from uh Mr dears
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the opportunity
 
01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:05.639 align:start position:0%
to speak on this uh I think that
 
01:45:08.209 --> 01:45:08.219 align:start position:0%
representative harp uh summed up the the
 
01:45:10.970 --> 01:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
committee discussion perfectly uh it was
 
01:45:12.890 --> 01:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
I think it was a very healthy discussion
 
01:45:16.189 --> 01:45:16.199 align:start position:0%
and uh what this bill would do would be
 
01:45:19.070 --> 01:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
to provide enabling legislation that
 
01:45:21.890 --> 01:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
would allow for uh communities to
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
include septic systems as part of either
 
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
storm water or their Wastewater utility
 
01:45:29.930 --> 01:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
the idea of course that this has
 
01:45:33.290 --> 01:45:33.300 align:start position:0%
multiple different kinds of effects or
 
01:45:34.910 --> 01:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
or might be used in different ways one
 
01:45:37.370 --> 01:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
could imagine an area around a lake
 
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
that's not amenable to say sewering to
 
01:45:42.109 --> 01:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
putting in a sewer system but could have
 
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
that group of of people and say a
 
01:45:45.770 --> 01:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
Housing Development around a lake that
 
01:45:47.570 --> 01:45:47.580 align:start position:0%
could join together and create a septic
 
01:45:50.090 --> 01:45:50.100 align:start position:0%
utility that would provide the ability
 
01:45:53.149 --> 01:45:53.159 align:start position:0%
to have a common pumping schedule to
 
01:45:55.370 --> 01:45:55.380 align:start position:0%
have a common replacement schedule to
 
01:45:57.530 --> 01:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
have a very predictable cost associated
 
01:46:00.410 --> 01:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
with it so that's one way in which you
 
01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
could see something like this we talked
 
01:46:03.770 --> 01:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
about the nitrogen issues around Great
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
Bay that there may be certain
 
01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
communities that want to include that as
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
part of their all of the above
 
01:46:10.910 --> 01:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
approaches to reduce nitrogen pollution
 
01:46:13.729 --> 01:46:13.739 align:start position:0%
in the Great Bay Estuary and we also
 
01:46:13.739 --> 01:46:14.629 align:start position:0%
in the Great Bay Estuary and we also
heard

01:46:14.629 --> 01:46:14.639 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:46:16.970 --> 01:46:16.980 align:start position:0%
um you know about low-income folks who
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
might be benefited by having their
 
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
communities with the ability to be able
 
01:46:25.189 --> 01:46:25.199 align:start position:0%
to serve up grants and loans that would
 
01:46:28.129 --> 01:46:28.139 align:start position:0%
be unavailable to individuals but could
 
01:46:30.590 --> 01:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
be available through a community to be
 
01:46:32.810 --> 01:46:32.820 align:start position:0%
able to help low-income individuals that
 
01:46:35.330 --> 01:46:35.340 align:start position:0%
have failing septic systems these are
 
01:46:39.169 --> 01:46:39.179 align:start position:0%
all possibilities that could come out of
 
01:46:42.890 --> 01:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
adopting a a septic utility as part of
 
01:46:45.070 --> 01:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
some other utility within your community
 
01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
so I think that that was the the nature
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
of it but as representative harb so
 
01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
clearly identified there are some
 
01:46:56.090 --> 01:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
problems with the language as it as it
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
exists today in the bill but most of
 
01:47:00.290 --> 01:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
those problems appear to be rectifiable
 
01:47:02.870 --> 01:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
so I think that that uh the committee
 
01:47:04.910 --> 01:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
had a again a healthy discussion about
 
01:47:06.649 --> 01:47:06.659 align:start position:0%
that and and I think that we agree that
 
01:47:11.090 --> 01:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:13.970 --> 01:47:13.980 align:start position:0%
any questions from members of the
 
01:47:13.980 --> 01:47:17.090 align:start position:0%
any questions from members of the
committee

01:47:17.090 --> 01:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:20.770 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:47:20.770 --> 01:47:20.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:24.530 --> 01:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
yeah we haven't I have a desk for a
 
01:47:26.330 --> 01:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
motion yet
 
01:47:29.570 --> 01:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
uh I just is only taught speaking on
 
01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:32.330 align:start position:0%
uh I just is only taught speaking on
Mike

01:47:32.330 --> 01:47:32.340 align:start position:0%
Mike
 
01:47:34.810 --> 01:47:34.820 align:start position:0%
I am
 
01:47:40.189 --> 01:47:40.199 align:start position:0%
concerned about the amount of power
 
01:47:42.649 --> 01:47:42.659 align:start position:0%
this bill might give
 
01:47:45.169 --> 01:47:45.179 align:start position:0%
to certain
 
01:47:45.179 --> 01:47:46.550 align:start position:0%
to certain
well

01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:47:49.250 --> 01:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
to Lo till we are not well let me
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
explain this way we are not a a local
 
01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.550 align:start position:0%
explain this way we are not a a local
control

01:47:55.550 --> 01:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
control
 
01:47:57.890 --> 01:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
State we're
 
01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
we're the the
 
01:48:04.010 --> 01:48:04.020 align:start position:0%
municipalities are the are an offshoot
 
01:48:07.070 --> 01:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
of to the basically the the children of
 
01:48:08.570 --> 01:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:48:13.370 --> 01:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
we local local control can get
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
if not carefully Managed IT get us into
 
01:48:20.050 --> 01:48:20.060 align:start position:0%
situations where uh
 
01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
more Authority is
 
01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:24.169 align:start position:0%
more Authority is
taken

01:48:24.169 --> 01:48:24.179 align:start position:0%
taken
 
01:48:27.530 --> 01:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
by those and at the local level than we
 
01:48:29.330 --> 01:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
really intended
 
01:48:32.330 --> 01:48:32.340 align:start position:0%
I think we've seen that in
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
in recent times at least at least I feel
 
01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
we've that's what's happened in recent
 
01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
we've that's what's happened in recent
times

01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:38.350 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:48:38.350 --> 01:48:38.930 align:start position:0%
times
[Music]

01:48:38.930 --> 01:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:40.450 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:48:40.450 --> 01:48:40.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:44.209 --> 01:48:44.219 align:start position:0%
also on the issue of the Great Bay we
 
01:48:47.390 --> 01:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
have the uh the EPA has
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
fallen into a lot of money lately I
 
01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
think if I'm not mistaken you correct me
 
01:48:53.870 --> 01:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong I think if as I read the
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
recent legislation they have uh I think
 
01:49:01.550 --> 01:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
is it tripled or quadruple the amount of
 
01:49:07.729 --> 01:49:07.739 align:start position:0%
money that's been uh given to the EPA to
 
01:49:11.570 --> 01:49:11.580 align:start position:0%
basically around projects and so there's
 
01:49:13.270 --> 01:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of money out there
 
01:49:17.590 --> 01:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
well if I remember the the Estuary issue
 
01:49:20.990 --> 01:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
you you gave us this pie chart where all
 
01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
of the things that were going into that
 
01:49:24.770 --> 01:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
into the bay and all the things that
 
01:49:26.629 --> 01:49:26.639 align:start position:0%
were causing the problems and the only
 
01:49:29.930 --> 01:49:29.940 align:start position:0%
one near uh the the EPA was saying to go
 
01:49:32.450 --> 01:49:32.460 align:start position:0%
after was this little section kind of
 
01:49:35.570 --> 01:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
con concerning septic systems and not
 
01:49:37.790 --> 01:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
about anything else
 
01:49:41.090 --> 01:49:41.100 align:start position:0%
so maybe the if the EPA wants it done
 
01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
well they should be able to kick up some
 
01:49:45.410 --> 01:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
more money
 
01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
and hopefully they will be able to they
 
01:49:50.090 --> 01:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
have a lot more to give out
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
let's see if our if our
 
01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:53.810 align:start position:0%
let's see if our if our
uh

01:49:53.810 --> 01:49:53.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:49:56.450 --> 01:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
whoever they whoever they may be our
 
01:49:59.090 --> 01:49:59.100 align:start position:0%
representatives in at the federal level
 
01:50:02.030 --> 01:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
should be looking to get something for
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
the estuary
 
01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:05.209 align:start position:0%
the estuary
uh

01:50:05.209 --> 01:50:05.219 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:13.609 --> 01:50:13.619 align:start position:0%
looking at about a recommendation to
 
01:50:17.090 --> 01:50:17.100 align:start position:0%
move forward on this uh but however I'm
 
01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:17.990 align:start position:0%
move forward on this uh but however I'm
not

01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:50:20.870 --> 01:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
putting pressure on anyone this is
 
01:50:24.050 --> 01:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
missed me by my myself
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
so vote your conscience but I will be
 
01:50:31.250 --> 01:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:33.169 --> 01:50:33.179 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
01:50:37.609 --> 01:50:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:39.530 --> 01:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair
 
01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:40.550 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair
um

01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:44.629 --> 01:50:44.639 align:start position:0%
the I know that generally New Hampshire
 
01:50:47.629 --> 01:50:47.639 align:start position:0%
is not a local control State and we do
 
01:50:52.669 --> 01:50:52.679 align:start position:0%
have some uh items that are uh state has
 
01:50:54.530 --> 01:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
preemption over like the use of
 
01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
pesticides and fertilizers towns can't
 
01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
regulate them but that is because more
 
01:51:03.410 --> 01:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
so because landscapers or people who
 
01:51:05.810 --> 01:51:05.820 align:start position:0%
work on projects where those items are
 
01:51:08.689 --> 01:51:08.699 align:start position:0%
used uh cross lines and are going in all
 
01:51:10.250 --> 01:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
different towns and then there's
 
01:51:12.590 --> 01:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
different rules for each town and that
 
01:51:14.810 --> 01:51:14.820 align:start position:0%
could be problematic but this one
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
enables towns municipalities to set up a
 
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
program for their town
 
01:51:27.229 --> 01:51:27.239 align:start position:0%
and develop a uh a residential
 
01:51:30.229 --> 01:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
program a program for the town which
 
01:51:33.050 --> 01:51:33.060 align:start position:0%
would then help the town to better deal
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
with this situation and Mr deers just
 
01:51:39.050 --> 01:51:39.060 align:start position:0%
testified that
 
01:51:41.570 --> 01:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
low-income people could there could be a
 
01:51:43.850 --> 01:51:43.860 align:start position:0%
fund developed to help the low-income
 
01:51:46.010 --> 01:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
people so it was not overwhelmingly
 
01:51:49.129 --> 01:51:49.139 align:start position:0%
expensive for them and
 
01:51:51.590 --> 01:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
um the EPA although you know we always
 
01:51:54.410 --> 01:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
would like more money from them much of
 
01:51:56.330 --> 01:51:56.340 align:start position:0%
the wastewater treatment plants that are
 
01:51:58.490 --> 01:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
getting funding this year and last year
 
01:52:00.590 --> 01:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
it has come from the federal government
 
01:52:04.490 --> 01:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
so it's in not the state so that's been
 
01:52:06.530 --> 01:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
we are getting money from the federal
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
government but I would I believe agree
 
01:52:11.209 --> 01:52:11.219 align:start position:0%
with representative renzuelo that we
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
need to do something and that we should
 
01:52:14.750 --> 01:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
have some future legislation although
 
01:52:16.609 --> 01:52:16.619 align:start position:0%
this bill is not it I think that's what
 
01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:20.639 align:start position:0%
you said is it probably yeah but I mean
 
01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak on the motion
 
01:52:32.209 --> 01:52:32.219 align:start position:0%
well there is no motion but anywhere
 
01:52:35.209 --> 01:52:35.219 align:start position:0%
else we should speak on the issue
 
01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:38.639 align:start position:0%
then grassy yes Mr chairman thank you
 
01:52:40.850 --> 01:52:40.860 align:start position:0%
um I think what you're looking at here
 
01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
is a bill and particularly after
 
01:52:45.050 --> 01:52:45.060 align:start position:0%
listening to the testimony from Mr deers
 
01:52:46.669 --> 01:52:46.679 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
even though we are not a local
 
01:52:49.970 --> 01:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
controlled state
 
01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
when you're dealing with
 
01:52:54.830 --> 01:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
this type of an incident with with you
 
01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
know pollution in the communities each
 
01:52:58.970 --> 01:52:58.980 align:start position:0%
Community deals with it differently
 
01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
trying to have regulations across the
 
01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
state that you know one size fits all is
 
01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:06.109 align:start position:0%
state that you know one size fits all is
impossible

01:53:06.109 --> 01:53:06.119 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
01:53:08.330 --> 01:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
and and doesn't always work and
 
01:53:09.649 --> 01:53:09.659 align:start position:0%
particularly when you're taking a look
 
01:53:12.530 --> 01:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
at communities that have water bodies
 
01:53:14.930 --> 01:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
next to them or Coastal communities or
 
01:53:17.810 --> 01:53:17.820 align:start position:0%
river communities communities need to
 
01:53:19.790 --> 01:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
take a look at how they deal with
 
01:53:22.850 --> 01:53:22.860 align:start position:0%
contaminations differently
 
01:53:25.490 --> 01:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
um and I'm looking at my community of
 
01:53:27.709 --> 01:53:27.719 align:start position:0%
Rochester now Rochester may or may not
 
01:53:29.870 --> 01:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
take advantage of this but if we did it
 
01:53:31.370 --> 01:53:31.380 align:start position:0%
may be a way that we could help reduce
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
some of the costs that's being inflicted
 
01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
upon the ratepayers of of because of of
 
01:53:39.709 --> 01:53:39.719 align:start position:0%
discharges into the uh kachiko river
 
01:53:42.109 --> 01:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
which go into gray Bay a lot of the
 
01:53:44.330 --> 01:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
Seacoast communities are being charged a
 
01:53:46.129 --> 01:53:46.139 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of money are being
 
01:53:48.410 --> 01:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
forced to do tremendous improvements to
 
01:53:50.030 --> 01:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
their wastewater treatment facilities
 
01:53:51.530 --> 01:53:51.540 align:start position:0%
because of contaminants that are going
 
01:53:52.850 --> 01:53:52.860 align:start position:0%
into their Rivers which end up in Great
 
01:53:55.370 --> 01:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
Bay by doing this it would give each
 
01:53:57.169 --> 01:53:57.179 align:start position:0%
individual Community the ability to deal
 
01:54:00.109 --> 01:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
with it the way it sees fit so yeah we
 
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
we're on a local controlled state but
 
01:54:04.729 --> 01:54:04.739 align:start position:0%
but we also all talk about local control
 
01:54:07.310 --> 01:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
that it's nice thing to be able to do
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
things at the local level instead of
 
01:54:10.729 --> 01:54:10.739 align:start position:0%
instead of having the state mandate
 
01:54:12.649 --> 01:54:12.659 align:start position:0%
things to them this is something that
 
01:54:15.770 --> 01:54:15.780 align:start position:0%
allows communities the options and
 
01:54:18.250 --> 01:54:18.260 align:start position:0%
another option in dealing with
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
pollution of of their water supplies and
 
01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
also the environment
 
01:54:26.209 --> 01:54:26.219 align:start position:0%
um you know these discharges whether it
 
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
be into an aquifer or
 
01:54:31.129 --> 01:54:31.139 align:start position:0%
you know a river or something that ends
 
01:54:32.810 --> 01:54:32.820 align:start position:0%
up in Great Bay
 
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
um communities need to be able to have
 
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
some flexibility in how they deal with
 
01:54:38.030 --> 01:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
the problem it's not just a mandate that
 
01:54:39.649 --> 01:54:39.659 align:start position:0%
comes down from the EPA and says you
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
shall do
 
01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
let the communities have some
 
01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility and this is one way we can
 
01:54:46.189 --> 01:54:46.199 align:start position:0%
give them flexibility and as was
 
01:54:48.169 --> 01:54:48.179 align:start position:0%
mentioned by Mr deersen and also
 
01:54:49.550 --> 01:54:49.560 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
01:54:51.709 --> 01:54:51.719 align:start position:0%
this allows communities also to work
 
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
with those people who are less fortunate
 
01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
who are unable to maybe replace the
 
01:54:58.910 --> 01:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
septic system by providing resources for
 
01:55:02.330 --> 01:55:02.340 align:start position:0%
them through grants or loans and I think
 
01:55:03.590 --> 01:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
this is something that we should
 
01:55:05.209 --> 01:55:05.219 align:start position:0%
recommend further legislation on this
 
01:55:05.219 --> 01:55:13.609 align:start position:0%
recommend further legislation on this
bill

01:55:13.609 --> 01:55:13.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:17.090 --> 01:55:17.100 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um I did vote to
 
01:55:19.129 --> 01:55:19.139 align:start position:0%
recommend this in the subcommittee I'm
 
01:55:22.669 --> 01:55:22.679 align:start position:0%
conf I'm somewhat unsure of uh what
 
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
those designations mean but I will be
 
01:55:28.490 --> 01:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
voting against I will be voting not to
 
01:55:32.450 --> 01:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
recommend it uh just because of the tax
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
when it when we heard the hearing you
 
01:55:36.590 --> 01:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
know when we had the hearing it was
 
01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the intent was to set up
 
01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:41.330 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the intent was to set up
attacks

01:55:41.330 --> 01:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
attacks
 
01:55:45.530 --> 01:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
for nitrogen on property owners based
 
01:55:49.010 --> 01:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
upon square footage of of impervious
 
01:55:52.250 --> 01:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
service surface of the of the particular
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
properties and I believe this is sounds
 
01:55:59.450 --> 01:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
like it's going to be very costly to uh
 
01:56:02.350 --> 01:56:02.360 align:start position:0%
to homeowners it's it's vague
 
01:56:05.390 --> 01:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
and so those are my concerns I I realize
 
01:56:08.510 --> 01:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
there's a nitrogen issue but having such
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
a large portion of the nitrogen coming
 
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
from rainfall
 
01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:14.450 align:start position:0%
from rainfall
um

01:56:14.450 --> 01:56:14.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:19.149 --> 01:56:19.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:23.330 --> 01:56:23.340 align:start position:0%
representative Spang thank you um
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
I regret or that or this is not my bill
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
but I think it's too bad that it got
 
01:56:33.310 --> 01:56:33.320 align:start position:0%
tied in with the stormwater utility
 
01:56:36.229 --> 01:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
storm I was the chair of the commission
 
01:56:38.750 --> 01:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
that looked at storm water and came up
 
01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
with this is the ideal uh solution
 
01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
but I think that it has Led Led our
 
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
committee to confuse what's happening
 
01:56:54.590 --> 01:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
here with the way a storm water utility
 
01:56:58.570 --> 01:56:58.580 align:start position:0%
is set up to work first of all
 
01:57:01.609 --> 01:57:01.619 align:start position:0%
no storm water utilities have been
 
01:57:05.090 --> 01:57:05.100 align:start position:0%
approved for any municipality in the
 
01:57:07.209 --> 01:57:07.219 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire yet
 
01:57:12.169 --> 01:57:12.179 align:start position:0%
so I think if this were to to
 
01:57:14.810 --> 01:57:14.820 align:start position:0%
were to be implemented it would depend
 
01:57:18.350 --> 01:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
upon the stormwater utility I think what
 
01:57:22.010 --> 01:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
Mr deers has says is saying that there
 
01:57:23.629 --> 01:57:23.639 align:start position:0%
are a lot of other things that could
 
01:57:27.950 --> 01:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
come out of this type of approach that
 
01:57:30.169 --> 01:57:30.179 align:start position:0%
would have nothing to do with the
 
01:57:32.270 --> 01:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
stormwater utility it would have nothing
 
01:57:34.370 --> 01:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
to do with attacks
 
01:57:37.370 --> 01:57:37.380 align:start position:0%
at all it would have nothing to do with
 
01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
the amount of square footage of
 
01:57:41.689 --> 01:57:41.699 align:start position:0%
impervious that all relates to the
 
01:57:45.430 --> 01:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
stormwater utility which I think
 
01:57:48.589 --> 01:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
uh obviously needs to be struck out of
 
01:57:50.990 --> 01:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
this approach
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
what Mr dears is pointing out is that
 
01:57:56.450 --> 01:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to be explored in terms of
 
01:58:00.229 --> 01:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
how we're going to deal with these uh
 
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
failing septic systems or particularly I
 
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
think someone was mentioning at the
 
01:58:08.089 --> 01:58:08.099 align:start position:0%
hearing about little neighborhoods where
 
01:58:09.950 --> 01:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
the whole neighborhood
 
01:58:12.970 --> 01:58:12.980 align:start position:0%
has failing systems
 
01:58:15.109 --> 01:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
and something needs to be done
 
01:58:17.570 --> 01:58:17.580 align:start position:0%
collectively perhaps but it has nothing
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
to do with setting up a stormwater
 
01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:23.050 align:start position:0%
to do with setting up a stormwater
utility

01:58:23.050 --> 01:58:23.060 align:start position:0%
utility
 
01:58:26.629 --> 01:58:26.639 align:start position:0%
also just setting up if an organization
 
01:58:28.129 --> 01:58:28.139 align:start position:0%
was set up
 
01:58:28.139 --> 01:58:29.330 align:start position:0%
was set up
um

01:58:29.330 --> 01:58:29.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:32.390 --> 01:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
might be called a utility but I don't
 
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
see any reason why it should be where it
 
01:58:38.810 --> 01:58:38.820 align:start position:0%
would be a structure where money could
 
01:58:40.669 --> 01:58:40.679 align:start position:0%
come in from the state and the federal
 
01:58:43.729 --> 01:58:43.739 align:start position:0%
government to then be given out to
 
01:58:46.609 --> 01:58:46.619 align:start position:0%
people who need that money to pump their
 
01:58:48.770 --> 01:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
septic systems to deal with failing
 
01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
septic systems or to perhaps set up a
 
01:58:57.290 --> 01:58:57.300 align:start position:0%
a neighborhood septic system a
 
01:59:00.229 --> 01:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
collective septic system so that has
 
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with any taxes whatsoever
 
01:59:07.850 --> 01:59:07.860 align:start position:0%
I think that given the number of things
 
01:59:10.629 --> 01:59:10.639 align:start position:0%
that Mr deers
 
01:59:13.550 --> 01:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
outline for us of way that we could be
 
01:59:16.129 --> 01:59:16.139 align:start position:0%
helping to deal with these septic
 
01:59:19.310 --> 01:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
systems all over town some of them
 
01:59:21.050 --> 01:59:21.060 align:start position:0%
Collective some of them are probably
 
01:59:24.109 --> 01:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
because of the financial disability of
 
01:59:26.890 --> 01:59:26.900 align:start position:0%
people to deal with their systems that
 
01:59:31.129 --> 01:59:31.139 align:start position:0%
that whole situation or condition that
 
01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
he is outlying is right for us to be
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
coming up with some idea about how to
 
01:59:42.770 --> 01:59:42.780 align:start position:0%
work more collectively to deal with
 
01:59:42.780 --> 01:59:44.209 align:start position:0%
work more collectively to deal with
these

01:59:44.209 --> 01:59:44.219 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:59:44.219 --> 01:59:48.109 align:start position:0%
these
hmm

01:59:48.109 --> 01:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:51.050 --> 01:59:51.060 align:start position:0%
thank you uh anyone else wish to speak
 
01:59:51.060 --> 01:59:52.430 align:start position:0%
thank you uh anyone else wish to speak
if

01:59:52.430 --> 01:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:59:54.350 --> 01:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
seeing no one else
 
01:59:56.410 --> 01:59:56.420 align:start position:0%
uh you've
 
01:59:59.629 --> 01:59:59.639 align:start position:0%
uh representative harp for a motion
 
02:00:03.050 --> 02:00:03.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'll again motion uh
 
02:00:09.050 --> 02:00:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:13.609 --> 02:00:13.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:15.709 --> 02:00:15.719 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton for us for a
 
02:00:15.719 --> 02:00:16.490 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton for us for a
second

02:00:16.490 --> 02:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:00:18.890 --> 02:00:18.900 align:start position:0%
uh with the speaker in your motion yes
 
02:00:20.629 --> 02:00:20.639 align:start position:0%
briefly thank you
 
02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
um as was mentioned as written I would
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
not support this bill but it has a
 
02:00:29.270 --> 02:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
flavor and a concept concerning certain
 
02:00:31.310 --> 02:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
items that I think should be addressed
 
02:00:35.089 --> 02:00:35.099 align:start position:0%
and future legislation and which I think
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
we're probably going to see so that's
 
02:00:40.070 --> 02:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
why I made the motion to recommend for
 
02:00:43.790 --> 02:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
future legislation thank you
 
02:00:47.689 --> 02:00:47.699 align:start position:0%
right seeing no one anyone else wish to
 
02:00:50.530 --> 02:00:50.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:53.330 --> 02:00:53.340 align:start position:0%
just want to speak on your uh
 
02:00:55.609 --> 02:00:55.619 align:start position:0%
on your motion no I just think it's an
 
02:00:57.649 --> 02:00:57.659 align:start position:0%
opportunity to move forward and it's a
 
02:00:59.689 --> 02:00:59.699 align:start position:0%
good start okay
 
02:01:01.970 --> 02:01:01.980 align:start position:0%

speak so the the motion is to recommend
 
02:01:09.649 --> 02:01:09.659 align:start position:0%
for future legislation yep oh okay

is that enough harp you'll write the
report

02:02:21.790 --> 02:02:21.800 align:start position:0%

thank you very much thank you very much
 
02:03:02.169 --> 02:03:02.179 align:start position:0%
for your help uh let's back up uh now
 
02:03:03.950 --> 02:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh let's see we've got remember the
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
house bill uh 1641 FM uh
 
02:03:16.910 --> 02:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton you are
 
02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:21.050 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton you are
reporting

02:03:21.050 --> 02:03:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:23.089 --> 02:03:23.099 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman
 
02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
um we met last week regarding this uh
 
02:03:28.189 --> 02:03:28.199 align:start position:0%
had extensive testimony from Captain
 
02:03:31.850 --> 02:03:31.860 align:start position:0%
Dunleavy the bottom line is that as a
 
02:03:34.689 --> 02:03:34.699 align:start position:0%
result of the the testimony we recommend
 
02:03:37.250 --> 02:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
going forward with Captain Donald's
 
02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation for a commission to
 
02:03:41.750 --> 02:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
study the issue
 
02:03:45.169 --> 02:03:45.179 align:start position:0%
essentially uh New Hampshire is out of
 
02:03:48.890 --> 02:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
compliance with federal law regarding
 
02:03:51.169 --> 02:03:51.179 align:start position:0%
um red voter registration
 
02:03:55.669 --> 02:03:55.679 align:start position:0%
because uh portions of our registration
 
02:04:00.350 --> 02:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
go to Des fish and game and the Peace
 
02:04:04.129 --> 02:04:04.139 align:start position:0%
Commission that is Those portions are in
 
02:04:05.930 --> 02:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
violation of federal law
 
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
uh so what the sub to me looked at was a
 
02:04:12.350 --> 02:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
two-prong approach uh one cabin done
 
02:04:14.930 --> 02:04:14.940 align:start position:0%
lady is working with Federal uh
 
02:04:17.629 --> 02:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
legislatures uh specifically Senator
 
02:04:19.129 --> 02:04:19.139 align:start position:0%
Sheen's office
 
02:04:23.209 --> 02:04:23.219 align:start position:0%
to get uh the federal law modified so
 
02:04:25.189 --> 02:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
that the seven states that are out of
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
compliance can fall in compliance now
 
02:04:30.109 --> 02:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
that is an ongoing discussion between
 
02:04:32.089 --> 02:04:32.099 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire the Coast
 
02:04:35.709 --> 02:04:35.719 align:start position:0%
Guard and the uh and the senator
 
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh by the same token the Coast Guard
 
02:04:41.330 --> 02:04:41.340 align:start position:0%
requires us to move forward to fall
 
02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
within the existing laws
 
02:04:47.810 --> 02:04:47.820 align:start position:0%
uh and cam don't let these team has come
 
02:04:50.750 --> 02:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
up with uh a way ahead
 
02:04:52.430 --> 02:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
um and so what we want to do is to
 
02:04:55.669 --> 02:04:55.679 align:start position:0%
codify that uh with a commission that
 
02:04:57.770 --> 02:04:57.780 align:start position:0%
would help New Hampshire resolve
 
02:04:57.780 --> 02:04:58.430 align:start position:0%
would help New Hampshire resolve
um

02:04:58.430 --> 02:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:02.030 --> 02:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
the conflict under the existing laws and
 
02:05:05.649 --> 02:05:05.659 align:start position:0%
so the subcommittee recommended 5-0 uh
 
02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
to proceed with legislation to recommend
 
02:05:17.330 --> 02:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:20.159 align:start position:0%

with what uh what you were asking for

okay uh do you wish to speak on your
 
02:10:14.209 --> 02:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
motion of course thank you Mr chair
 
02:10:17.030 --> 02:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
um when this when we voted on this bill
 
02:10:21.890 --> 02:10:21.900 align:start position:0%
earlier uh the legislature was in
 
02:10:26.270 --> 02:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
um the midst of passing uh House Bill
 
02:10:28.910 --> 02:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
1188 which sets up a long-term
 
02:10:32.270 --> 02:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
commission to study ohrv statutes in
 
02:10:35.629 --> 02:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
this state and representative Egan who
 
02:10:38.089 --> 02:10:38.099 align:start position:0%
sponsored this bill thought that the
 
02:10:39.950 --> 02:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
commission to do this would have more
 
02:10:42.530 --> 02:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
time and could address this issue and
 
02:10:46.490 --> 02:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
set up a safety program and in listening
 
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
to comments from the stakeholders that I
 
02:10:52.490 --> 02:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
have spoken with and representative
 
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
renzulu I believe met with the ohrv
 
02:10:59.030 --> 02:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
community last week this is something
 
02:11:01.609 --> 02:11:01.619 align:start position:0%
that is going to take all the
 
02:11:04.129 --> 02:11:04.139 align:start position:0%
stakeholders coming together so then
 
02:11:06.589 --> 02:11:06.599 align:start position:0%
rather than having another yet another
 
02:11:10.010 --> 02:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
piece of ohrv legislation that the ohrv
 
02:11:12.109 --> 02:11:12.119 align:start position:0%
commission could take this on and get it
 
02:11:17.270 --> 02:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:19.070 --> 02:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
so that's why I would say to not
 
02:11:21.229 --> 02:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation because
 
02:11:23.890 --> 02:11:23.900 align:start position:0%
the issue is already being
 
02:11:26.330 --> 02:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
going to be taken care by the commission
 
02:11:28.250 --> 02:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
which is now law and getting ready to
 
02:11:32.530 --> 02:11:32.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:34.609 --> 02:11:34.619 align:start position:0%

you're recognizing you're recognizing me
 
02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
for a motion I'll move to uh recommend
 
02:14:37.609 --> 02:14:37.619 align:start position:0%
for further legislation right now also
 
02:14:39.770 --> 02:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
02:14:41.990 --> 02:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh you're you're going to write or the
 
02:14:44.750 --> 02:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh yeah Mr chairman yeah the the
 
02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh heard extensive testimony
 
02:14:49.189 --> 02:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
on this uh and particularly from the
 
02:14:51.290 --> 02:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
folks at historic resources and the
 
02:14:54.050 --> 02:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
municipal Association and uh we were
 
02:14:57.109 --> 02:14:57.119 align:start position:0%
also given examples such as the uh
 
02:14:59.330 --> 02:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
the situation which occurred in in
 
02:15:01.069 --> 02:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth where Graves were discovered
 
02:15:03.290 --> 02:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
and they were the way the the remains
 
02:15:05.930 --> 02:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
were handled and reinterred uh they felt
 
02:15:07.729 --> 02:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
that the process was was an excellent
 
02:15:09.470 --> 02:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
process to use and they would they felt
 
02:15:13.250 --> 02:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
that this bill helped um codify uh the
 
02:15:16.189 --> 02:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
process for dealing with these Graves
 
02:15:18.470 --> 02:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
um the recommendation of the committee
 
02:15:20.390 --> 02:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
was to recommend for further legislation
 
02:15:22.490 --> 02:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
but I think that the the one problem
 
02:15:24.950 --> 02:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
that we had is that we could not agree
 
02:15:28.370 --> 02:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
on what that was uh to be I fully expect
 
02:15:31.069 --> 02:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
that the sponsor will be reintroducing
 
02:15:33.290 --> 02:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
this bill next session and I would hope
 
02:15:34.910 --> 02:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
that the committee would look at it
 
02:15:37.669 --> 02:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
favorably and work on our differences to
 
02:15:40.069 --> 02:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
try to work something out there was a
 
02:15:42.109 --> 02:15:42.119 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion about
 
02:15:44.209 --> 02:15:44.219 align:start position:0%
um you know that all people should be
 
02:15:47.689 --> 02:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
dealt with equally what is the
 
02:15:50.450 --> 02:15:50.460 align:start position:0%
interesting thing here is that when
 
02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
discussions particularly with the folks
 
02:15:54.470 --> 02:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
from historic resources uh spoke it was
 
02:15:54.480 --> 02:15:55.609 align:start position:0%
from historic resources uh spoke it was
that

02:15:55.609 --> 02:15:55.619 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:15:58.850 --> 02:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
people of African descent were not
 
02:16:00.830 --> 02:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
treated as humans they were treated as
 
02:16:03.470 --> 02:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
property many of them are not buried
 
02:16:07.310 --> 02:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
within any well-identified cemetery plot
 
02:16:11.330 --> 02:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
or Apostle and you they tend to be found
 
02:16:11.340 --> 02:16:13.729 align:start position:0%
or Apostle and you they tend to be found
everywhere

02:16:13.729 --> 02:16:13.739 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
02:16:16.910 --> 02:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
um and similar to the way indigenous
 
02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
people are found in many cases and there
 
02:16:21.770 --> 02:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
are a number of cases historical
 
02:16:23.629 --> 02:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
resources state that there were you know
 
02:16:25.310 --> 02:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
certainly this is something they deal
 
02:16:28.930 --> 02:16:28.940 align:start position:0%
with a lot when they find these Graves
 
02:16:32.750 --> 02:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
and a lot of it is just folklore
 
02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes that they find that a certain
 
02:16:37.009 --> 02:16:37.019 align:start position:0%
person had a farm he owned a number of
 
02:16:39.650 --> 02:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
slaves here in New Hampshire and that
 
02:16:41.450 --> 02:16:41.460 align:start position:0%
they are buried somewhere in the field
 
02:16:43.669 --> 02:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
on the back of the field they're the
 
02:16:46.849 --> 02:16:46.859 align:start position:0%
back 40 and that we needed to have
 
02:16:49.549 --> 02:16:49.559 align:start position:0%
special considerations because the way
 
02:16:53.450 --> 02:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
that a lot of these African
 
02:16:56.629 --> 02:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
Aerials where there were very ceremonial
 
02:16:59.990 --> 02:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
and that in order to deal with them we
 
02:17:02.929 --> 02:17:02.939 align:start position:0%
need to deal with them differently than
 
02:17:06.190 --> 02:17:06.200 align:start position:0%
we deal with others uh particularly
 
02:17:09.830 --> 02:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
European descendants and
 
02:17:12.169 --> 02:17:12.179 align:start position:0%
um you know when they were found working
 
02:17:15.650 --> 02:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
with The Descendant Community was quite
 
02:17:17.990 --> 02:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
important when they deal with an
 
02:17:20.690 --> 02:17:20.700 align:start position:0%
indigenous person they deal with The
 
02:17:23.629 --> 02:17:23.639 align:start position:0%
Descendant Community uh being the Indian
 
02:17:26.209 --> 02:17:26.219 align:start position:0%
tribes that are in the area dealing with
 
02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
with those people and and what they
 
02:17:30.830 --> 02:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
would would be very interested in
 
02:17:32.750 --> 02:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
working is is to work with the
 
02:17:35.389 --> 02:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
African-American descendant community in
 
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
the reinternment of many of these uh
 
02:17:41.030 --> 02:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
bones that are that are discovered
 
02:17:42.969 --> 02:17:42.979 align:start position:0%
so it was recommended further
 
02:17:45.410 --> 02:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
legislation we couldn't agree on what
 
02:17:48.049 --> 02:17:48.059 align:start position:0%
that legislation may be but I think that
 
02:17:50.929 --> 02:17:50.939 align:start position:0%
the the committee overall did uh agree
 
02:17:55.629 --> 02:17:55.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:57.490 --> 02:17:57.500 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
02:17:59.690 --> 02:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
representative uh Creighton and
 
02:18:04.009 --> 02:18:04.019 align:start position:0%
representative uh uh Cohen
 
02:18:04.019 --> 02:18:04.910 align:start position:0%
representative uh uh Cohen
yeah

02:18:04.910 --> 02:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:18:07.669 --> 02:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
yeah I completely agree with what
 
02:18:10.549 --> 02:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
representative grassy uh indicated as
 
02:18:13.570 --> 02:18:13.580 align:start position:0%
the results of the subcommittee meeting
 
02:18:17.629 --> 02:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
uh I do believe that that language is
 
02:18:21.589 --> 02:18:21.599 align:start position:0%
possible that would be acceptable all
 
02:18:24.049 --> 02:18:24.059 align:start position:0%
um and I think we should work on that
 
02:18:26.389 --> 02:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
um we'll figure something out I think
 
02:18:30.610 --> 02:18:30.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:30.620 --> 02:18:32.450 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:18:32.450 --> 02:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:18:34.310 --> 02:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative Cohen and representative
 
02:18:36.169 --> 02:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
representative post yeah I'm definitely
 
02:18:38.690 --> 02:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
in favor of this bill in some form I
 
02:18:41.509 --> 02:18:41.519 align:start position:0%
think we promote and we legislate to
 
02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
Value diversity in New Hampshire I think
 
02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
this is a foundation for making up for a
 
02:18:49.009 --> 02:18:49.019 align:start position:0%
problem that might exist and not reflect
 
02:18:51.709 --> 02:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
positively on valuing diversity here in
 
02:18:53.389 --> 02:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
the state so I'm definitely in favor of
 
02:18:55.790 --> 02:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
pushing this board and having it looked
 
02:18:57.589 --> 02:18:57.599 align:start position:0%
at as what if there's tweaks in the
 
02:18:57.599 --> 02:18:59.509 align:start position:0%
at as what if there's tweaks in the
future

02:18:59.509 --> 02:18:59.519 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:19:02.810 --> 02:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
uh representative post thank you Mr
 
02:19:05.629 --> 02:19:05.639 align:start position:0%
chair I just want to say um the
 
02:19:09.889 --> 02:19:09.899 align:start position:0%
historian Ben Wilson spoke to us and uh
 
02:19:11.030 --> 02:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
he was going to look up some information
 
02:19:13.730 --> 02:19:13.740 align:start position:0%
we had questions on that I think will be
 
02:19:16.549 --> 02:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
helpful in creating legislation thank
 
02:19:16.559 --> 02:19:19.129 align:start position:0%
helpful in creating legislation thank
you

02:19:19.129 --> 02:19:19.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:21.770 --> 02:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
uh is there anyone else represent

02:19:27.950 --> 02:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair this was a
 
02:19:30.169 --> 02:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
fascinating hearing it went on for a
 
02:19:32.389 --> 02:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
couple of hours great hearing it was
 
02:19:34.669 --> 02:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
great it really really was and I just
 
02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate when we met with the
 
02:19:39.230 --> 02:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
gentleman who testified at length from
 
02:19:42.709 --> 02:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
cultural resources this happens monthly
 
02:19:46.910 --> 02:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
that they you know discover someone and
 
02:19:49.969 --> 02:19:49.979 align:start position:0%
um the man he he was very good at
 
02:19:53.030 --> 02:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
discussing what the chain of custody is
 
02:19:56.870 --> 02:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
for a corpse that is found or a skeleton
 
02:19:58.969 --> 02:19:58.979 align:start position:0%
or whatever it might be and how
 
02:20:01.070 --> 02:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
important it is to get that to their
 
02:20:02.990 --> 02:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
next person and so I'm thinking about it
 
02:20:05.270 --> 02:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
like be laying it to the correct culture
 
02:20:07.730 --> 02:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
and I really really appreciate what
 
02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative Cohen said because the
 
02:20:12.110 --> 02:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
diversity is something that we are
 
02:20:14.210 --> 02:20:14.220 align:start position:0%
working at so hard right now and it
 
02:20:15.889 --> 02:20:15.899 align:start position:0%
really does recognize that there's a
 
02:20:18.590 --> 02:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
specific situation in this culture and I
 
02:20:20.090 --> 02:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
would hope that we would always look at
 
02:20:21.889 --> 02:20:21.899 align:start position:0%
cultures and think about their specific
 
02:20:24.349 --> 02:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
situations the way that we have this one
 
02:20:26.990 --> 02:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so much Mr chair
 
02:20:29.990 --> 02:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish this uh wish the
 
02:20:33.770 --> 02:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
speaker observed I will uh I'll give I'm
 
02:20:35.200 --> 02:20:35.210 align:start position:0%
going to give my two cents
 
02:20:35.210 --> 02:20:35.810 align:start position:0%
going to give my two cents

02:20:36.650 --> 02:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
the first of all the hearing that we had
 
02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
I wish the people who were testif had
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
testified had been at our original
 
02:20:49.550 --> 02:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
hearing uh you really uh we learned a
 
02:20:51.410 --> 02:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
lot at least I learned a lot I think
 
02:20:53.950 --> 02:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
most everyone else
 
02:20:57.230 --> 02:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
there learned a heck of a lot I think it
 
02:21:00.190 --> 02:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
started one of the with one of
 
02:21:02.990 --> 02:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
Representative Creighton's just said it
 
02:21:05.090 --> 02:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
started off with what happens if I find
 
02:21:09.050 --> 02:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
a skull in my yard I mean and uh well
 
02:21:10.910 --> 02:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
you know and
 
02:21:15.410 --> 02:21:15.420 align:start position:0%
it was quite uh quite an education and
 
02:21:18.290 --> 02:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
uh and a lot of good back back and forth
 
02:21:20.630 --> 02:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
I think one of the things that to me
 
02:21:26.230 --> 02:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
what I saw and found was that instead of
 
02:21:30.770 --> 02:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
focusing this the issue on one specific
 
02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
group of people
 
02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
it would have been better
 
02:21:40.969 --> 02:21:40.979 align:start position:0%
to have raised the is raised the uh
 
02:21:44.110 --> 02:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
the the treatment of
 
02:21:50.510 --> 02:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh Graves uh opened and of of these of
 
02:21:53.469 --> 02:21:53.479 align:start position:0%
individuals individual Graves
 
02:21:55.969 --> 02:21:55.979 align:start position:0%
raised them to a certain a specific
 
02:21:55.979 --> 02:21:57.650 align:start position:0%
raised them to a certain a specific
level

02:21:57.650 --> 02:21:57.660 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:22:00.530 --> 02:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
that commensurate with the fact that
 
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
they are
 
02:22:03.889 --> 02:22:03.899 align:start position:0%
our history
 
02:22:07.130 --> 02:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
they are the graves is is where most of
 
02:22:10.450 --> 02:22:10.460 align:start position:0%
our history is in it ends up buried
 
02:22:10.460 --> 02:22:12.190 align:start position:0%
our history is in it ends up buried
and

02:22:12.190 --> 02:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:22:15.710 --> 02:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
our knowledge comes much of archeology
 
02:22:19.130 --> 02:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
comes from grapes uh that we should
 
02:22:21.710 --> 02:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
treat them all with the same level of
 
02:22:21.720 --> 02:22:23.349 align:start position:0%
treat them all with the same level of
respect

02:22:23.349 --> 02:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
respect
 
02:22:26.690 --> 02:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunately I feel that
 
02:22:30.070 --> 02:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
we by
 
02:22:35.210 --> 02:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
focusing on one specific group
 
02:22:37.490 --> 02:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
we're not we're getting we're we're
 
02:22:40.849 --> 02:22:40.859 align:start position:0%
we're not giving equity
 
02:22:44.330 --> 02:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
to the all the other groups who may have
 
02:22:47.809 --> 02:22:47.819 align:start position:0%
similar feelings treat all the same
 
02:22:52.070 --> 02:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's how that's what I felt
 
02:22:54.290 --> 02:22:54.300 align:start position:0%
should uh we should have come out with
 
02:22:57.830 --> 02:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
we did not we came up specifically with
 
02:23:01.370 --> 02:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
uh it was that was not undertaken by the
 
02:23:04.010 --> 02:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
by the vote I don't I don't believe
 
02:23:06.590 --> 02:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh however
 
02:23:10.910 --> 02:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
so I I voted against the uh the
 
02:23:12.889 --> 02:23:12.899 align:start position:0%
recommendation to uh but I'm going to
 
02:23:15.469 --> 02:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
change my vote and I will uh I will
 
02:23:19.070 --> 02:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
recommend I will vote to go on because I
 
02:23:21.710 --> 02:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
uh because I think there is it it's
 
02:23:23.389 --> 02:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
important that
 
02:23:26.150 --> 02:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
we try that I will try to my best to
 
02:23:27.469 --> 02:23:27.479 align:start position:0%
change this
 
02:23:31.010 --> 02:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
to a bill that recognizes
 
02:23:34.610 --> 02:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
the same Dignity of all people and
 
02:23:38.870 --> 02:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
treatment of all people with the uh with
 
02:23:42.230 --> 02:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh that there that gray whose graves are
 
02:23:43.730 --> 02:23:43.740 align:start position:0%
being moved
 
02:23:48.290 --> 02:23:48.300 align:start position:0%
and uh or graves are found uh you I
 
02:23:52.429 --> 02:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
think also uh We've the issue was
 
02:23:55.429 --> 02:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
if you read the bills the bill was
 
02:23:57.050 --> 02:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
02:24:02.030 --> 02:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
a a segment that was focused on the very
 
02:24:06.830 --> 02:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
the most extreme ends where you find a
 
02:24:11.090 --> 02:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
body in the woods or something to uh to
 
02:24:15.650 --> 02:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
a cemetery where someone is has been
 
02:24:20.809 --> 02:24:20.819 align:start position:0%
buried and and stay in Past Times
 
02:24:23.150 --> 02:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
and there's a whole wide spectrum in
 
02:24:28.190 --> 02:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
between we concentrated mostly on the
 
02:24:31.130 --> 02:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
initial finding of the finding of
 
02:24:34.610 --> 02:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
uh of air of graves that we didn't know
 
02:24:36.190 --> 02:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
were there
 
02:24:39.950 --> 02:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
and that so we we did miss the
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
discussion on the other end of the
 
02:24:44.630 --> 02:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
spectrum but other than that uh I I
 
02:24:47.450 --> 02:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
think we did a lot of work and I thank
 
02:24:51.530 --> 02:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
the work the the uh Mr Wilson for his
 
02:24:55.610 --> 02:24:55.620 align:start position:0%

02:25:02.690 --> 02:25:02.700 align:start position:0%
educating us on what he has to do and it
 
02:25:05.929 --> 02:25:05.939 align:start position:0%
was very very interesting and I if you
 
02:25:08.570 --> 02:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
get a chance it says if it's on the
 
02:25:11.469 --> 02:25:11.479 align:start position:0%

I just want to address the committee and
 
02:26:34.309 --> 02:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
thank them for some of the work we've
 
02:26:36.410 --> 02:26:36.420 align:start position:0%
done this year I'm I have chosen not to
 
02:26:38.870 --> 02:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
run for reelection so I will not be
 
02:26:41.090 --> 02:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
serving on this committee next year but
 
02:26:43.250 --> 02:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
I know it's been a trying year between
 
02:26:45.530 --> 02:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
uh the Republican Democrats in general
 
02:26:48.230 --> 02:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
but in this committee most people are
 
02:26:49.849 --> 02:26:49.859 align:start position:0%
similar in thoughts in perfecting the
 
02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
environment and I think it's a good
 
02:26:54.530 --> 02:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
example of bipart a lot of bipartisan
 
02:26:56.510 --> 02:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
work and cooperation discussions going
 
02:26:58.849 --> 02:26:58.859 align:start position:0%
on and I just thank you for that and
 
02:27:00.349 --> 02:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
wish those that are coming back next
 
02:27:02.570 --> 02:27:02.580 align:start position:0%

02:27:23.389 --> 02:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
that's right those are mines so yeah
 
02:27:28.429 --> 02:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
what would you do it there
 
02:27:30.969 --> 02:27:30.979 align:start position:0%
on my desk
 
02:27:33.530 --> 02:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
but thank you very much representative
 
02:27:36.290 --> 02:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
Spang and uh uh
 
02:27:39.469 --> 02:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
yes yes thank you Mr Chim
 
02:27:40.910 --> 02:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I think that you know
 
02:27:41.990 --> 02:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
certainly we're all going to miss
 
02:27:44.510 --> 02:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
Judith's brownies but I think one of the
 
02:27:45.830 --> 02:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
things we're going to miss more as well
 
02:27:47.570 --> 02:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
is that we have a number of members who
 
02:27:48.889 --> 02:27:48.899 align:start position:0%
are leaving this year that have a
 
02:27:51.290 --> 02:27:51.300 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of talent and
 
02:27:52.969 --> 02:27:52.979 align:start position:0%
knowledge about the issues that we deal
 
02:27:55.370 --> 02:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
with this is my third term on this
 
02:27:57.050 --> 02:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm looking around the
 
02:27:59.750 --> 02:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
room and everybody else on this
 
02:28:02.450 --> 02:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
committee except for the three who three
 
02:28:05.090 --> 02:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
of who are leaving us
 
02:28:06.710 --> 02:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
have less time than I have on this
 
02:28:08.330 --> 02:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
community and yourself Mr chairman I
 
02:28:12.349 --> 02:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
neglected you intentionally but you know
 
02:28:15.650 --> 02:28:15.660 align:start position:0%
I don't want you to get upset the the
 
02:28:18.290 --> 02:28:18.300 align:start position:0%
three members three members and and not
 
02:28:21.050 --> 02:28:21.060 align:start position:0%
to belittle certainly Mr Cohen next to
 
02:28:23.150 --> 02:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
me but the three members that we have
 
02:28:25.070 --> 02:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
that are leaving us have years and years
 
02:28:27.290 --> 02:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
of experience on this committee that I
 
02:28:29.510 --> 02:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
know I will certainly Miss and I'm and
 
02:28:30.950 --> 02:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
and it's something that we cannot
 
02:28:34.309 --> 02:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
replace and uh you know that I want to
 
02:28:35.630 --> 02:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
thank them for the years that they put
 
02:28:38.570 --> 02:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
in here and all the Talking that Judith
 
02:28:40.929 --> 02:28:40.939 align:start position:0%
has done I you know
 
02:28:43.370 --> 02:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
it's a personal joke between her and I
 
02:28:47.630 --> 02:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
but uh the the thing is is that you know
 
02:28:49.790 --> 02:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
they're just so invaluable and and I I
 
02:28:52.490 --> 02:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
don't know I I need to get you on speed
 
02:28:54.950 --> 02:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
dial because I know if I'm here back
 
02:28:57.050 --> 02:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
next year here as well I will be calling
 
02:28:58.969 --> 02:28:58.979 align:start position:0%
you frequently you know particularly
 
02:29:01.309 --> 02:29:01.319 align:start position:0%
when it comes to oh RVs which you know I
 
02:29:03.170 --> 02:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
need you know we need that we need that
 
02:29:04.910 --> 02:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
those those these people here and we're
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
losing them this year so thank you for
 
02:29:13.429 --> 02:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:15.889 --> 02:29:15.899 align:start position:0%
before I say something
 
02:29:18.530 --> 02:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
go right ahead all right
 
02:29:20.510 --> 02:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
um I've been serving on this committee
 
02:29:22.730 --> 02:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
for 10 years I've been the chair I've
 
02:29:24.170 --> 02:29:24.180 align:start position:0%
been the ranking member I've been the
 
02:29:27.050 --> 02:29:27.060 align:start position:0%
vice chair and one of the things that
 
02:29:28.849 --> 02:29:28.859 align:start position:0%
and before that I was on environment and
 
02:29:31.670 --> 02:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
agriculture for two terms I learned from
 
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
the chair and the ranking member on that
 
02:29:36.770 --> 02:29:36.780 align:start position:0%
committee the advantages and the
 
02:29:38.750 --> 02:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
benefits to everyone on the committee
 
02:29:41.450 --> 02:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
when the chair and the ranking member
 
02:29:44.690 --> 02:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
can get along and work together to
 
02:29:47.389 --> 02:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
develop good policies and not put
 
02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
politics first but put policy first and
 
02:29:54.110 --> 02:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
I think that what I learned on Ena and I
 
02:29:57.050 --> 02:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
brought over to resources and since that
 
02:30:00.170 --> 02:30:00.180 align:start position:0%
time it's been just a pleasure to serve
 
02:30:02.870 --> 02:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
on this committee and work with all of
 
02:30:08.510 --> 02:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:10.410 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:30:10.410 --> 02:30:14.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
[Applause]

02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
02:30:17.809 --> 02:30:17.819 align:start position:0%
and anyone else yes I'll have to say
 
02:30:20.469 --> 02:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
something thank you yeah
 
02:30:23.030 --> 02:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
well I've been on this committee 12
 
02:30:23.040 --> 02:30:23.950 align:start position:0%
well I've been on this committee 12
years

02:30:23.950 --> 02:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:30:27.469 --> 02:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
and one segment of two years when I had
 
02:30:31.250 --> 02:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
a Hiatus I still came down and testified
 
02:30:34.809 --> 02:30:34.819 align:start position:0%
and had other people putting my bills in
 
02:30:37.969 --> 02:30:37.979 align:start position:0%
and I would say you know some of our Big
 
02:30:41.450 --> 02:30:41.460 align:start position:0%
Adventures were wild goose and which was
 
02:30:46.969 --> 02:30:46.979 align:start position:0%
an unending Saga finally settled and I
 
02:30:50.150 --> 02:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
was able to do a lot of things for my
 
02:30:51.710 --> 02:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
Lake community
 
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
and that was really really important and
 
02:30:58.550 --> 02:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
and representative renzulo I'll probably
 
02:31:01.730 --> 02:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
if you're back here which I suspect you
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
will I'll be down sitting out there and
 
02:31:09.469 --> 02:31:09.479 align:start position:0%
uh you know encouraging you you know
 
02:31:13.550 --> 02:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
yeah but like that right yeah pointing
 
02:31:16.429 --> 02:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
your fingers yeah and and and you know
 
02:31:18.469 --> 02:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
the one thing that's sort of too bad
 
02:31:21.770 --> 02:31:21.780 align:start position:0%
from my point of view is that because of
 
02:31:21.780 --> 02:31:23.090 align:start position:0%
from my point of view is that because of
covid

02:31:23.090 --> 02:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
covid
 
02:31:27.490 --> 02:31:27.500 align:start position:0%
I did not get to know the uh
 
02:31:30.530 --> 02:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
Republican members of this committee as
 
02:31:33.469 --> 02:31:33.479 align:start position:0%
well as I might have liked to and that
 
02:31:36.110 --> 02:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
was uh sort of that that I think was in
 
02:31:39.770 --> 02:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
for unfortunate because I always enjoyed
 
02:31:44.150 --> 02:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
and felt it was important to work with
 
02:31:46.849 --> 02:31:46.859 align:start position:0%
the other part of the committee whether
 
02:31:49.190 --> 02:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
we were in charge or we were not in
 
02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:50.349 align:start position:0%
we were in charge or we were not in
charge

02:31:50.349 --> 02:31:50.359 align:start position:0%
charge
 
02:31:53.450 --> 02:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
and it was
 
02:31:57.190 --> 02:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
my privilege always to be able to find
 
02:32:00.050 --> 02:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
bipartisan sponsors of bills and I hope
 
02:32:02.450 --> 02:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
you'll all keep doing that I'm sure you
 
02:32:02.460 --> 02:32:04.130 align:start position:0%
you'll all keep doing that I'm sure you
will

02:32:04.130 --> 02:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
will
 
02:32:08.510 --> 02:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:11.150 --> 02:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
Representatives Bank I've served on this
 
02:32:14.210 --> 02:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
committee for 22 years
 
02:32:14.220 --> 02:32:15.070 align:start position:0%
committee for 22 years
um

02:32:15.070 --> 02:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:15.080 --> 02:32:16.670 align:start position:0%
um
one

02:32:16.670 --> 02:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:32:19.730 --> 02:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
once I guess it was two years maybe as
 
02:32:19.740 --> 02:32:20.770 align:start position:0%
once I guess it was two years maybe as
chair

02:32:20.770 --> 02:32:20.780 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:32:20.780 --> 02:32:22.309 align:start position:0%
chair
and

02:32:22.309 --> 02:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:32:25.370 --> 02:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
um it's always been it's always been
 
02:32:28.070 --> 02:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
really fun I enjoy natural resource
 
02:32:32.570 --> 02:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
issues so I really enjoyed all of the
 
02:32:34.730 --> 02:32:34.740 align:start position:0%
people that have been working with me on
 
02:32:40.309 --> 02:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
at DES and Dread Etc and EPA but also
 
02:32:43.250 --> 02:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee I have
 
02:32:46.990 --> 02:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
worked for decades on land protection
 
02:32:51.050 --> 02:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
and I remember talking to one of my my
 
02:32:53.150 --> 02:32:53.160 align:start position:0%
colleagues my older colleagues who had
 
02:32:56.270 --> 02:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
been at it much longer than I about dang
 
02:32:59.030 --> 02:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
it that's a really important piece of
 
02:33:01.550 --> 02:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
property and she she keeps saying she
 
02:33:04.130 --> 02:33:04.140 align:start position:0%
wants to conservative and she never does
 
02:33:07.969 --> 02:33:07.979 align:start position:0%
and he smiled at me and he said Judith
 
02:33:10.969 --> 02:33:10.979 align:start position:0%
this you're in it for the long run you
 
02:33:13.910 --> 02:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
know things good things will eventually
 
02:33:17.389 --> 02:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
happen you know the the time and the
 
02:33:20.330 --> 02:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
effort that you have put into it
 
02:33:24.530 --> 02:33:24.540 align:start position:0%
um will over time have some effect
 
02:33:26.809 --> 02:33:26.819 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking that this committee is
 
02:33:29.510 --> 02:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
the same that because we haven't had
 
02:33:32.030 --> 02:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
much time to get together and to share
 
02:33:35.410 --> 02:33:35.420 align:start position:0%
thoughts and opinions and information
 
02:33:38.889 --> 02:33:38.899 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's going to be a longer term
 
02:33:42.889 --> 02:33:42.899 align:start position:0%
for everybody on this committee is as
 
02:33:45.770 --> 02:33:45.780 align:start position:0%
comfortable with with these issues and
 
02:33:48.530 --> 02:33:48.540 align:start position:0%
with the people we work with as those of
 
02:33:52.070 --> 02:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
us who have served for a longer time but
 
02:33:55.190 --> 02:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
I welcome you to that Journey you will
 
02:33:59.450 --> 02:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
really enjoy it you'll find that your
 
02:34:02.090 --> 02:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
opinions about things and your
 
02:34:04.309 --> 02:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
understanding of issues will draw
 
02:34:08.330 --> 02:34:08.340 align:start position:0%
together closer and closer as time goes
 
02:34:10.610 --> 02:34:10.620 align:start position:0%
on and this and the state of New
 
02:34:13.190 --> 02:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will very much profit from it
 
02:34:17.630 --> 02:34:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:17.640 --> 02:34:26.870 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:34:26.870 --> 02:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:29.630 --> 02:34:29.640 align:start position:0%
I'm losing friends
 
02:34:29.640 --> 02:34:30.889 align:start position:0%
I'm losing friends
and

02:34:30.889 --> 02:34:30.899 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:33.349 --> 02:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
maybe that's what uh that's what you
 
02:34:36.710 --> 02:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
build here you build relationships
 
02:34:36.720 --> 02:34:38.030 align:start position:0%
build here you build relationships
and

02:34:38.030 --> 02:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:41.389 --> 02:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
I've had relationships with friendships
 
02:34:41.399 --> 02:34:43.429 align:start position:0%
I've had relationships with friendships

02:34:54.290 --> 02:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
Smith uh and you learn from them I mean
 
02:34:56.270 --> 02:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
I've been here uh well I've been here
 
02:34:56.280 --> 02:34:58.130 align:start position:0%
I've been here uh well I've been here
now

02:34:58.130 --> 02:34:58.140 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:35:01.490 --> 02:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
uh this is my eighth term going on nine
 
02:35:06.590 --> 02:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
maybe unless unless unless they uh the
 
02:35:10.849 --> 02:35:10.859 align:start position:0%
voters catch up with me uh but the uh
 
02:35:14.510 --> 02:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
I've learned that I've
 
02:35:17.030 --> 02:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
said you know seven of those years have
 
02:35:19.070 --> 02:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
been uh seven of those terms have been
 
02:35:22.969 --> 02:35:22.979 align:start position:0%
here and uh once once I got here
 
02:35:25.370 --> 02:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
I stayed because it was it was the best
 
02:35:28.730 --> 02:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
committee I've learned so much uh I've
 
02:35:30.950 --> 02:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
learned I've learned so much from
 
02:35:32.630 --> 02:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
02:35:35.990 --> 02:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh mostly how to you know
 
02:35:39.770 --> 02:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
I'm a I'm a political person if you look
 
02:35:42.950 --> 02:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
at my if you look if you look at my
 
02:35:46.790 --> 02:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
record here I've been a deputy uh you
 
02:35:49.070 --> 02:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
know whip I've been floor leader I've
 
02:35:51.530 --> 02:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
been uh all of that's all those things
 
02:35:54.050 --> 02:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
on the political end only twice have I
 
02:35:55.370 --> 02:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
been chair
 
02:36:01.429 --> 02:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
and this is one of them and uh I
 
02:36:04.370 --> 02:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
it's a diff it's a being a being
 
02:36:07.250 --> 02:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
legislative as opposed to political is
 
02:36:08.750 --> 02:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
very different
 
02:36:12.469 --> 02:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
and it was a change for me to an EXT to
 
02:36:15.170 --> 02:36:15.180 align:start position:0%
an extent because uh you when you pull
 
02:36:17.690 --> 02:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
it when you legislative you have to
 
02:36:21.670 --> 02:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
have to put in all people's ideas and
 
02:36:25.849 --> 02:36:25.859 align:start position:0%
representative Smith taught me that so
 
02:36:28.190 --> 02:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
I'm glad she's going to be around on the
 
02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:28.990 align:start position:0%

02:36:35.630 --> 02:36:35.640 align:start position:0%

02:36:38.210 --> 02:36:38.220 align:start position:0%
she believed she got the temperament for
 
02:36:40.990 --> 02:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:45.410 --> 02:36:45.420 align:start position:0%

um thank you Mr chair I just want to say
 
02:37:22.250 --> 02:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
that when I don't know why we do what we
 
02:37:26.889 --> 02:37:26.899 align:start position:0%
do and we do so many things for a reason
 
02:37:29.750 --> 02:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
and those reasons are based on
 
02:37:32.510 --> 02:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
institutional history that can never be
 
02:37:32.520 --> 02:37:33.710 align:start position:0%
institutional history that can never be
replaced

02:37:33.710 --> 02:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
replaced
 
02:37:38.330 --> 02:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
