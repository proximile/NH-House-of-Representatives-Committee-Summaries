that took place last week sure well um
 
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
as most of the committee knows at this
 
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
point but representative uh Grossman's
 
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 align:start position:0%
one of her twin boys Oscar actually had
 
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
a very traumatic fall and is in critical
 
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 align:start position:0%
condition um down at Mass General so
 
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh I have been asked if we
 
00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
could spend a brief minute
 
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 align:start position:0%

hands on Oscar and his family during

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 align:start position:0%
time please give them strength and send
 
00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 align:start position:0%
them your love and our love and know
 
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
that our thoughts and prayers are with
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
amen I open the hearing on House Bill
 
00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 align:start position:0%
4:30 reducing the retention period for
 
00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 align:start position:0%
records of unfounded abuse and neglect
 
00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
reports by DHHS Prime sponsor uh
 
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
committee I introduced this bill
 
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
uh because I believe 10 years of
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
exessive if you read through this bill
 
00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
you'll see that a screened out report is
 
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
already kept for four
 
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
years if at some point that screened out
 
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
report is deemed
 
00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
unfounded it's kept for an additional 10
 
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 align:start position:0%
years from the date that the report was
 
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.430 align:start position:0%
years from the date that the report was
deemed

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
deemed
 
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
unfounded this does not deal with
 
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
reports that were deemed founded
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
or unfounded but with reasonable concern
 
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
those are kept
 
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
indefinitely this is dealing only with
 
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.029 align:start position:0%
indefinitely this is dealing only with
unfounded

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
reports and having a report kept for 10
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
years hanging over the heads of a family
 
00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:21.879 align:start position:0%
like the sort of
 
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
Damocles is an
 
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
unreasonable mental anguish for that
 
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
family especially where if at any time
 
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
during that 10 years another false
 
00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:36.039 align:start position:0%
report is made against the family and
 
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
it's deemed unfounded again the clock
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
starts at 10 years for all previous
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
reports that were deemed
 
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
unfounded so you could have a
 
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
multiplying effect of report after
 
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
report after report 10 years starting
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
all over again and they won't go away
 
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
and by the time they do go away that
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
child is more than 50 % chance is now a
 
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
grown adult and the family still has
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
this hanging over their
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
head I can bring an
 
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
example from several years ago when I
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
was speaking with one of the members of
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
the police training
 
00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:18.039 align:start position:0%
facility and he'd been through a divorce
 
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
and had custody of his children and uh
 
00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
50% and
 
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
uh oddly enough every time that there
 
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
was some major event that they were
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
going to be celebrating together with it
 
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
be a trip to Disney World or whether it
 
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
be the sweet 16 birthday of the daughter
 
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
or uh some other family gathering where
 
00:08:39.389 --> 00:08:39.399 align:start position:0%
he was taking the children
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere a few weeks before that was to
 
00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
happen a report would be
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
made with
 
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:51.160 align:start position:0%
DCF and it was his belief that his
 
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
ex-wife was behind it just to sort of
 
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
spoil his time with the children but
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
each time that happened of course he had
 
00:08:59.949 --> 00:08:59.959 align:start position:0%
an unfounded report that would then
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
start over
 
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.870 align:start position:0%
start over
again

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
and these don't go away
 
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
quickly I believe that three years is
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable three years gives the chance
 
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
that it can go away before another
 
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
report is falsely made against a
 
00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:25.959 align:start position:0%
family I believe that in as much as we
 
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
as legislators are supposed to protect
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
children from from the abuse of
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
strangers and bad parents we also need
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
to protect those families and those
 
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
children from abuse by the
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
state and holding these kinds of things
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
over the head of a family is mental
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
abuse it
 
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
constitutes something that is always
 
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
there always hanging over them and it's
 
00:10:00.509 --> 00:10:00.519 align:start position:0%
like a a Paul cast upon the family for
 
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
away this would not stop the clock
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
restarting with another abuse case filed
 
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
but it would be for three years not
 
00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.750 align:start position:0%
but it would be for three years not
10

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
10
 
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
and we some of us may disagree whether
 
00:10:26.829 --> 00:10:26.839 align:start position:0%
three is better than 10 I think we can
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
all hopefully agree that 10 is excessive
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
it's almost the entire lifespan of the
 
00:10:37.389 --> 00:10:37.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
18 I would inform the committee that I
 
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem if we come up with
 
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
a number in between three and 10 if
 
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
that's something the committee wants to
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
entertain but I believe we have to make
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
progress in trying to
 
00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:51.269 align:start position:0%
progress in trying to
alleviate

00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
alleviate
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
the uh burden of having this something
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
that the state holds over the heads when
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
it's an unfounded report
 
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
to have it have it there on an innocent
 
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
family where it can be constantly
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
referenced by people as you know well
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
they've got a report on them sitting
 
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.870 align:start position:0%
they've got a report on them sitting
with

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
dcyf and again I'll reiterate a founded
 
00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
report is kept
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
indefinitely and one that's as as if you
 
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
line 10 you'll see uh founded unfounded
 
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
but with reasonable concern is also kept
 
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:35.240 align:start position:0%
indefinitely so if there's any concern
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
and they report is unfounded but with
 
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable concern this doesn't apply
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
but if it's totally
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
unfounded there's no reason to keep that
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
report hanging over the family for 10
 
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
years and with that I'll take any
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
questions your most recent comment uh
 
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
goes to a question I had written down
 
00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
that unfounded does not mean there's no
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
problem it's just is's not enough proof
 
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's the difference between being
 
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
innocent and not guilty um but you what
 
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
you just said seemed to answer my
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
question in line 10 an unfounded report
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
but there is reasonable
 
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
concern um does keep the report on file
 
00:12:23.069 --> 00:12:23.079 align:start position:0%
is that correct assumption indefinitely
 
00:12:26.189 --> 00:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Greg thank
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
you so just to clarify you are aware
 
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:29.710 align:start position:0%
you so just to clarify you are aware
that

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
unfounded um in unfounded without
 
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
anything else does not mean that there
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
was nothing found it also does not mean
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
a false report correct I do know that
 
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
okay follow up and are you also aware
 
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
that and maybe the people that are
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
concerned about this this is not like a
 
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
a sex offenders list or anything where
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
people can look this up it's incredibly
 
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
hard to obtain and look to see if there
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
is some kind of a um report even
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
unfounded on somebody this is not
 
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
something that there is a register of
 
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
that anybody can see an employer family
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
member anything else are you aware of
 
00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of that however it also
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
is in the minds of the people in that
 
00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
family constantly until it goes away
 
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
it's as though they have to live with
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
this ghost hanging over
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
them until it's
 
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
gone representative rice thank you Mr
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
question so would you not agree that by
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
keeping these unfounded reports for the
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
length of time we did could also be
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
helpful if you are finding malicious
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
reporting you would have a record of all
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
of these unfounded reports to help prove
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
malicious reporting and I believe that
 
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:47.240 align:start position:0%
could be done uh yes thank you for your
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
question uh I believe that could be done
 
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
in 3 years I believe that any follow-up
 
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
investigation that isn't completed in 3
 
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
years is probably not going to happen
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
but having it sit there for 10 is
 
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:06.550 align:start position:0%
but having it sit there for 10 is
excessive

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
passing around some written testimony um
 
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
and we are here today in opposition to
 
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:49.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
430 um a number of reasons for this um
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
one of them being it directly impacts
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
the day-to-day work of the office of the
 
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
child advocate in part of our work we're
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
looking at Trends in the system things
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
that are working well areas of
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
improvement and to be able to do so
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
having history of families um the any
 
00:15:11.069 --> 00:15:11.079 align:start position:0%
touch points they've had with the agency
 
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
any actions by the agency in that time
 
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
frame allows us to see if the agency is
 
00:15:18.509 --> 00:15:18.519 align:start position:0%
growing in the right direction um in
 
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
addition to that we also see over time
 
00:15:24.269 --> 00:15:24.279 align:start position:0%
in many um cases that we review
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
particularly um in a lot of the critical
 
00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
incidents that we review and which
 
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
critical incidents are serious injuries
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
to Children um it can be a child
 
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
fatality it can also include parent
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
fatalities uh we review all of those in
 
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
our office and in doing so an aspect of
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
that is looking at all of the history of
 
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
those families um unless it is a newborn
 
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:49.160 align:start position:0%
baby we always see that there has been
 
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
prior history at the point of going to a
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
critical incident if it's a firstborn
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
child often times there may not be a
 
00:15:57.309 --> 00:15:57.319 align:start position:0%
history but when we actually have gone
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
back and looked at our CS every every
 
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
single cir has at least one call in to
 
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
the agency before it's risen to the
 
00:16:05.069 --> 00:16:05.079 align:start position:0%
point that something serious has
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
happened to that child or to that family
 
00:16:12.309 --> 00:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
unit um we also look at this as calls
 
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
are coming in and if we receive calls of
 
00:16:16.269 --> 00:16:16.279 align:start position:0%
concern to our office that somebody is
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
worried about a child the first thing
 
00:16:19.949 --> 00:16:19.959 align:start position:0%
that we do is go in directly into the
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
dcyf case management system and see what
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
touch points that family has had with
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
the agency um in that we have found
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
times where it has taken multiple
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
reports over lengthy periods of time to
 
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
truly build the full picture of what
 
00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
that child is experiencing so it may be
 
00:16:38.829 --> 00:16:38.839 align:start position:0%
you know the first call from a school
 
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
Personnel saying the child's falling
 
00:16:42.749 --> 00:16:42.759 align:start position:0%
asleep in school something seems off
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
then it may be a call from a neighbor
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
we're hearing a lot of yelling in the
 
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
home something is happening and it
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
actually takes a totality of all of
 
00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
those calls to build the full picture to
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
say this is rising to the level of abuse
 
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
or neglect the first few calls very well
 
00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
could be screened out but with those
 
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
screened screen outs living in the
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
system the agency is able to look back
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
and paint a picture of what is this
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
child truly going through and do we need
 
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
to intervene to support this family and
 
00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
ensure the safety of that particular
 
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
child I also do want to thank
 
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative rice for her comment um
 
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
because we have seen it work in that
 
00:17:18.029 --> 00:17:18.039 align:start position:0%
aspect as well we have seen where you
 
00:17:20.029 --> 00:17:20.039 align:start position:0%
can go back into records and see that
 
00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
there may be a history of malicious
 
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:25.079 align:start position:0%
calls um typically when we review those
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
kinds of cases it does have to do with
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
um a nasty divorce and one parent may be
 
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
calling repeatedly against the other
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
parent and by having that in the system
 
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
it is protective to that one parent who
 
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
is doing right by their child and it
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
builds that history so when the next
 
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
call comes in they can see those priors
 
00:17:42.909 --> 00:17:42.919 align:start position:0%
and say this sounds like what's been
 
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
called in time and time again and we
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
know it's not abuse or neglect we know
 
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:47.720 align:start position:0%
this is you know clearly there's
 
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
something playing out here in the
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
Dynamics in this family um and it's not
 
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the agency to be
 
00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
involved so it does work um we see it
 
00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
working both ways but there is a lot
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
that we can gain from that history and
 
00:18:00.909 --> 00:18:00.919 align:start position:0%
having that historical information um
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
not only benefits the work that we do in
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
trying to improve the overall system but
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
it does improve the day-to-day work of
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
social workers within DCF and it is
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
actually um within their own policies
 
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
that they are to um review the the
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
history when they have a new call come
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
in about a family so they're really
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
assessing that the full picture of the
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
family with any information that they've
 
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
ever received on
 
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
them uh we also attached some data there
 
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
for you um on the final page um and so
 
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
this is some data that we pulled um
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
reports made to intake during um January
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
2025 so those first few bullet points
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
there are specific to this past month um
 
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.470 align:start position:0%
there are specific to this past month um
and

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
the typically because of the time frame
 
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
we don't have um founded unfounded or or
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
incomplete results of an investigation
 
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
30 days later so we pulled
 
00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
2024 data to take a look at um the
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
founded unfounded and incomplete and as
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
you will see um what they have here and
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
these are for all calls received to the
 
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
division in that time frame um
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
78% for whether it be founded unfounded
 
00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
or incomplete so all calls in 2024 that
 
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
came in 78% had previous referrals at
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
some point um and if you look at the
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
data there we also include um percentage
 
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
of reports with referrals that were more
 
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
than 3 years um since and so we have all
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
of that data there for you to um look
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
into a bit more but wanted to share that
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
it is very relevant that do come back to
 
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.430 align:start position:0%
it is very relevant that do come back to
the

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
system and I just wanted to reiterate
 
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
from a a legal standpoint uh
 
00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
representative Greg's Point um the
 
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
central registry which only contains
 
00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:44.039 align:start position:0%
founded reports is itself incredibly
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
difficult to access under New Hampshire
 
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
law very few entities even get access to
 
00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:51.919 align:start position:0%
that it is certainly not public record
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
and in fact um people you may think
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
would have access to central registry do
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
not the founded in screen notes which
 
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
are live entirely within dcf's internal
 
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
database is accessible to essentially no
 
00:20:10.149 --> 00:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
one outside of DCF the office of child
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
advocate has access specifically through
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
our statute under a very strict
 
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
confidentiality mou and those records
 
00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
are protected by 170 g8a they are not
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
accessible by a 91a record request and
 
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
170 GAA is extremely narrowly tailored
 
00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039 align:start position:0%
to only allow access to a very small
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
group of folks including parents who are
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
the subject of those reports but
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise it is not as though these
 
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
records are publicly accessible public
 
00:20:44.669 --> 00:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
knowledge um so the confidentiality
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
around these records regardless of how
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
High representative rice thank you Mr
 
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
question do you happen to know what the
 
00:21:01.149 --> 00:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
averages for other states I did we just
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
put this in like in
 
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
2017 or something right because that was
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
best practices for other states yes that
 
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
is that is accurate I don't have the
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
average for other states but um I can
 
00:21:17.789 --> 00:21:17.799 align:start position:0%
say for neighboring states that we end
 
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
up working with on a regular basis they
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
do maintain their records for quite some
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
time you know if we have a family that's
 
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
come here from another state the state
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire will request those
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
records and they can get a a very ly um
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
time frame of records from those States
 
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
as well and so some of them have a a
 
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
lifetime where they they keep them
 
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:37.240 align:start position:0%
forever for the the history of their
 
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
agency um and others do have that the
 
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
longer time frame that we we um strove
 
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire to raise in it was
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
about 2017 yes that's correct thank you
 
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you would you believe
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
that New York keeps theirs for 10 years
 
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
past the youngest child in the family's
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
18th birthday in Massachusetts keeps the
 
00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:01.559 align:start position:0%
indefinitely yes I can absolutely say
 
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
for my work in Massachusetts they do
 
00:22:05.269 --> 00:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
keep them indefinitely there yes um and
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
and yes that time frame for New York
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
would be accurate as well yes thank you
 
00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.630 align:start position:0%
would be accurate as well yes thank you
representative

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question would you agree
 
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
that there are times in um in the case
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
of a family with multiple children that
 
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
the oldest child um might have there
 
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
might be reports about the oldest child
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
that might be unfounded but with younger
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
children subsequent reports might show a
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
a more I'm struggling to find the word
 
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
but more intensity of abuse to that
 
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
would rise to the occasion of um having
 
00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:46.039 align:start position:0%
some action taken and then when you look
 
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
back you might need to uh provide help
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
and services for the older child as well
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely um so there there are
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
many cases that we review in our office
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
where um an older child may even be
 
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:01.240 align:start position:0%
freed for adoption um and adopted out of
 
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
the system because of severity of
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
parenting at that time and then later
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
down the line parents have other
 
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
children um and if they do become reinol
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
it's it is often looking for their
 
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
Trends in Behavior because what that
 
00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
tells us those calls are telling us the
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
behavior of that parent um and their
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
parenting style and there are plenty of
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
times where a child could be adopted out
 
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
and the family could really learn from
 
00:23:27.269 --> 00:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
that and and take services and grow and
 
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to parent
 
00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
successfully in the future it is not an
 
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
automatic because you had a termination
 
00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
of your rights on another child that the
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
system is is following you or is is
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
tracking if you're going to have other
 
00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:40.919 align:start position:0%
children that does not happen um but
 
00:23:42.669 --> 00:23:42.679 align:start position:0%
there are other times where we see then
 
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
those same behaviors that had happened
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
in a case that could have been 10 plus
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
years ago it those behaviors are
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
resurfacing with a new child born and so
 
00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
that tells us that that parent hasn't
 
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to learn and grow
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
their behavior in a more POs to to um
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
create more positive parenting in the
 
00:24:00.029 --> 00:24:00.039 align:start position:0%
future and that history of what happened
 
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
with that older child is very important
 
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
to understand what may play out with
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
that new child and to be able to prevent
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
something serious from happening um and
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
agency any other questions for our
 
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
friends from OCA no seeing none thank
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
you so much thank
 
00:24:24.909 --> 00:24:24.919 align:start position:0%
you chair
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
recognizes attorney Susan larabe
 
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:32.200 align:start position:0%
from DCF who
 
00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.510 align:start position:0%
from DCF who
has

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
information good morning Susan laraby
 
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
general counsel for DCF and I'm going to
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
have in my my brain the brevity and
 
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
concise and clear uh recommendation that
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
you mentioned before and listening to
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
the OCA as well as listening to
 
00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:51.039 align:start position:0%
everyone's questions here I really do
 
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
not have much much to add except for I
 
00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:56.200 align:start position:0%
think as written there may be some um
 
00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies of now with the
 
00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:58.950 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies of now with the
retention

00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
retention
 
00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
because as it's written now the
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
retention of a screenout and again just
 
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
to define a screen out is when a case is
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
called into Central intake and it does
 
00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
not meet a definition of abuse and
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
neglect so it is never even referred in
 
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
for an assessment is what's called
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
screened out and the way the bill is
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
written that remains untouched so that
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
would be retained for 4
 
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
years however an unfounded report
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
would be now retained for 3 years so an
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
unfounded report in which it was
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
screened in for an assessment there was
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
enough evidence at that point to screen
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
it in it did meet one the definition
 
00:25:44.389 --> 00:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
taking at face meet one the definitions
 
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
for abuse and neglect would be kept for
 
00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:49.240 align:start position:0%
a shorter period of time than a screened
 
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
out case and representative rice you are
 
00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
correct as well as representative Nelson
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
there were many changes that have been
 
00:25:58.389 --> 00:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
made to the retention uh statute through
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
out many years of working on this as
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
well as one of the latest changes in
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
2017 also added another component of how
 
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
an unfounded report could be used under
 
00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
the definition section I'm sorry the
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
evidence section of 169
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
C12 uh the evidence section it says that
 
00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:23.559 align:start position:0%
in any hearing under this chapter the
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
court shall not be bound by the
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
technical Rules of Evidence and may
 
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
admit evidence which it considers
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
relevant and material and then added in
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
2017 evidence of Prior unfounded or
 
00:26:39.389 --> 00:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
unfounded reports of abuse and neglect
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
shall be admissible in proceedings under
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
this chapter in order to establish a
 
00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
relevant pattern or course of
 
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
conduct so we just want to be clear that
 
00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
that unfounded is used in many different
 
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
areas of the 169c including 169 C12 as I
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
just mentioned as well as 169
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
c34 which lays out the different duties
 
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Health and Human
 
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
Services DCF in particular when we are
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
investigating and assessing uh cases of
 
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect specifically
 
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
section uh B which states determine
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
whether any person in the same family or
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
household was named in a prior report of
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect and if there are two or
 
00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
more prior unfounded or unfounded but
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
with reasonable concern reports
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
involving any family or household member
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
conduct an administrative review of all
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
identified reports because as many of
 
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
you mentioned on this panel is essential
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
to make sure internally that we have not
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
missed something that there is is there
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
a reason why there has been two
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
unfounded reports on this family and
 
00:27:59.509 --> 00:27:59.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
requires us to do
 
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to take any other
 
00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
questions do you find it very difficult
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
at DCF to have a whole group of people
 
00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:11.519 align:start position:0%
very angry at you because uh you didn't
 
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:14.200 align:start position:0%
take a child from a bad home and another
 
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
group equally angry that you did and is
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
that difficult of course it's difficult
 
00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
but of course we're here to follow the
 
00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:25.039 align:start position:0%
law and first and foremost make sure
 
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
every child that we are touching upon is
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
is safe and evaluate that safety and
 
00:28:32.909 --> 00:28:32.919 align:start position:0%
that risk and make sure again at the end
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
of the day we have not missed something
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
inside that
 
00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:40.350 align:start position:0%
inside that
family

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
representative sorry thank you Mr
 
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for asking my for
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
answering my question um I am very new
 
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
to child and family this is my first
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
year um but I did notice in the bill it
 
00:28:56.909 --> 00:28:56.919 align:start position:0%
refers to a report that is unfounded but
 
00:28:58.830 --> 00:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
with reasonable concern
 
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering how many cases if you have
 
00:29:04.269 --> 00:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
any statistics on how many cases are
 
00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559 align:start position:0%
found are labeled as unfounded but with
 
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable concern I do not have that
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
data in front of me I know we do track
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
that data and I could provide that for
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
you and I will I do believe that was
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
that uh category unfounded with
 
00:29:21.789 --> 00:29:21.799 align:start position:0%
reasonable concerns was one of the
 
00:29:24.269 --> 00:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
latest changes that have have been made
 
00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
to the statute um I okay
 
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
and basically what that means is that
 
00:29:32.909 --> 00:29:32.919 align:start position:0%
there is still insufficient evidence to
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
sustain a pro a preponderance of the
 
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
evidence finding however there is
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable concerns there's probable
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
cause so it's at that very beginning
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
stage representative cousen for the
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
followup um do parents know uh the
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
difference between an unfounded and a
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
unfounded with reasonable concern and I
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
only asked that because I've never heard
 
00:29:59.870 --> 00:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
a parents say well it was unfounded with
 
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable concern it's always they drop
 
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
it at
 
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
unfounded yes when this the case is
 
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:08.440 align:start position:0%
actually closed they are given not just
 
00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
verbal uh they're given verbal U
 
00:30:12.509 --> 00:30:12.519 align:start position:0%
conversations with their case worker the
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
assistant worker they're also giving a
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
form a formal letter which identifies
 
00:30:19.149 --> 00:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
that that category has been made lets
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
them know that they have not been added
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
to the central registry that there's
 
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
still no finding against them however
 
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
defines what that concern is what is
 
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
that reasonable
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
concern any further
 
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you counselor
 
00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:37.559 align:start position:0%
appreciate and this concludes the
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 4:30 we will not
 
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
be executing this until early March so
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
therefore if people wish to amend it
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
tweak it do whatever with with it look
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
I open the hearing on House Bill 187
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
relative to restraining orders sought by
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
a parent on behalf of a minor child
 
00:31:15.629 --> 00:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
welcome good morning Mr chairman members
 
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
of the committee happy to be with you
 
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
this morning to introduce this bill that
 
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
I hope will represent just a bit of
 
00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
housekeeping and a simple fix to a
 
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.190 align:start position:0%
 
up

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
so for the record representative Mike
 
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
beler Caroll District 4
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
Wakefield first as you members of this
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
committee I'm sure are very well aware
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
children are in a bit of a unique
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
position because many of their rights
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
and privileges as Citizens are held in
 
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
trust by their parents or Guardians for
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
them until they reach the age of
 
00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.310 align:start position:0%
them until they reach the age of
majority

00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
majority
 
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
this acknowledges the basic fact that
 
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
children are not independent rather
 
00:32:07.149 --> 00:32:07.159 align:start position:0%
children are quite
 
00:32:10.269 --> 00:32:10.279 align:start position:0%
dependent unfortunately it appears that
 
00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
we have crafted law I believe probably
 
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
in error as the result of the evolution
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
of laws over
 
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
time that deprives children of certain
 
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
legal remedies that are otherwise
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
available to
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
adults I believe this circumstance it
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
presently exists is actually in
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
violation of the United States
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution amendment 14 clause for
 
00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
equal protection we're simply not
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
allowed to craft law that treats people
 
00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
differently under different under the
 
00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.590 align:start position:0%
differently under different under the
same

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
circumstances presently there are a
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
variety of options legal options for
 
00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
adults to seek restraining orders that
 
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
extend past the borders of their own
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
household to other members of
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
Society it does appear that we en we
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
lack the enabling legislation that
 
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
allows children to exercise that same
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
privilege of law through their parents
 
00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:14.919 align:start position:0%
by bringing restraining orders on their
 
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
behalf um now to address a different a
 
00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:19.720 align:start position:0%
little bit of a different issue perhaps
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
there is some skepticism I don't know
 
00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
about this committee but I have a little
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
bit of skepticism myself if I'm honest
 
00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
about some of the due process Provisions
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
that exist
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
in restraining orders generally however
 
00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
let me be clear that any consternation
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
about that should not be a reason to
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
oppose this legislation because that's
 
00:33:42.029 --> 00:33:42.039 align:start position:0%
not the principle at play here the
 
00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:44.120 align:start position:0%
principle at play here is that something
 
00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
available to adults generally should not
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
be prohibited from children under law a
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
legal remedy now there are some specific
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances that led to me bringing
 
00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
this bill a constituent of mine brought
 
00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
forward I'm not going to go into detail
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
on that I'm sure some other people will
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
speak to the um rather horrific
 
00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances that this unfortunate
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
error has led to in New Hampshire
 
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
law but the bottom line is this the
 
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
principle here at play is impartiality
 
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
and equal protection and we should not
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
make any remedy available to an adult an
 
00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
adult that isn't also available for a
 
00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
child with an adult their Guardian
 
00:34:27.149 --> 00:34:27.159 align:start position:0%
acting on their behalf and with that I'm
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
Raymond uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh my
 
00:34:40.349 --> 00:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
question so my question is about where
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
this bill is aimed to go in statute
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
because it is being put into RSA 169c
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
which is the child abuse and neglect
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
statute and the rest the entire rest of
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
that statute is only people who are
 
00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:54.919 align:start position:0%
legally responsible for the care of the
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
child who can be charged with abuse and
 
00:35:00.109 --> 00:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
neglect whereas my understanding of this
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
this particular bill it's to be aimed at
 
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
somebody who is not a member of that
 
00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
child's household who has no legal
 
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
Authority and thus would not otherwise
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
be covered by the statute so my question
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
is why would the bill not focus on a on
 
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:19.720 align:start position:0%
a civil restraining order which would
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
cover like an adult to an adult or any
 
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
other person why not make a carve out
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
under the Civil restraining order
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
protection that allows an adult to seek
 
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
civil restraining order for a child
 
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so frankly
 
00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:35.720 align:start position:0%
our laws where it comes to restraining
 
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
orders generally exist as a bit of a
 
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
patchwork it is frankly Beyond me to and
 
00:35:44.589 --> 00:35:44.599 align:start position:0%
my capability and expertise to try to
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
recraft the whole of restraining order
 
00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
law to no longer be a patchwork I'm
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
trying to work within the existing
 
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
framework and it is this law that
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
enables parents to bring this civil
 
00:36:00.589 --> 00:36:00.599 align:start position:0%
complaint for restraining order on
 
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
behalf of their child so it was it was
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
just a simple matter of this is where it
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
already was this is where the error I
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
believe exists in language that only
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
extends it to a Minor's family or
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
household so this was the logical place
 
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
to work for the time being at least
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
until such a time comes that somebody
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
far more expert than I am can sort out
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
the broader Patchwork of issues that
 
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.710 align:start position:0%
 
presentative

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
presentative
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question and you and I
 
00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
have spoken and we have both spoken to
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
the same family and thank you for so
 
00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
eloquently presenting the bill and um
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
and the problem would you agree that
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
right now without
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
this becoming law there are children in
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who are in Danger from
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
people who they should be kept away
 
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
from yes and thank you for the question
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
and and as I said without getting too
 
00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:07.839 align:start position:0%
deeply into the broader questions about
 
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
restraining orders in general we have a
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
system in place that allows adults to
 
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
reek restraining orders for a variety of
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
reasons including members outside their
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
own household and we as a body have
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
affirmed those laws meaning that we as a
 
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
body seem to think that there are adults
 
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
in danger who should be protected but
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
yes unfortunately due to some I believe
 
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
some errors that
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
happened as the laws evolved children
 
00:37:32.829 --> 00:37:32.839 align:start position:0%
were left out of this and are therefore
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
continuing to be in the kind of danger
 
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:37.720 align:start position:0%
that we've protected adults from and we
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
should therefore extend that protection
 
00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:43.470 align:start position:0%
should therefore extend that protection
to

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
Children any other questions of the
 
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you for
 
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you and the chair
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%

can you hear me now um my name is Landa
 
00:38:14.589 --> 00:38:14.599 align:start position:0%
Peterson I actually created Jade's law
 
00:38:14.599 --> 00:38:15.670 align:start position:0%
Peterson I actually created Jade's law
in

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
2019 and um sorry it's very emotional
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
for me um I was contacted by Bikers
 
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
Against Child Abuse that they were
 
00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
helping another family and was made Ware
 
00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
that the wording in the law only States
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
for family and I just wanted to come
 
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
down here today to say that that was
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
never my
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
intention um when I spoke about it
 
00:38:44.589 --> 00:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
before in testimony I I said um Soccer
 
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
Coaches pastors it didn't matter who the
 
00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
person was I believe that all the
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
children should have the same rights and
 
00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:57.640 align:start position:0%
protections as everybody else um
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
I am currently using Jade's law because
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
our Predator was family um and I'm glad
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
we made it um I'm happy that another
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
family has the opportunity to speak on
 
00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:14.200 align:start position:0%
it and hopefully change the
 
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.710 align:start position:0%
it and hopefully change the
wording

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
wording
 
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
um I just want to help all the families
 
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
and all the kids and um help them feel
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%

Sirles and I'm here here today in hopes
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
of resolving a serious issue that my
 
00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
family has run into this past summer I
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
discovered that one of my children was a
 
00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
victim of sexual abuse at the hands of
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
their best friend's
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
father when the state police got
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
involved in the case they instructed me
 
00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
to go to the courthouse and file for a
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
restraining order on behalf of my child
 
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
I did what I was instructed to do sadly
 
00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:21.559 align:start position:0%
the judge had to deny the protection
 
00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
orders that I requested on behalf of my
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
child the reason my request was denied
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
is because the child protection act RSA
 
00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.710 align:start position:0%
is because the child protection act RSA

informed that the clerk by the clerk
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%

restraining
 
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
order the way the law currently stands a
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
minor must file for a restraining order
 
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
for themselves no matter their age or
 
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
intellectual abilities I believe this is
 
00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
an oversight in the law the age of
 
00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
majority in New Hampshire is 18 years
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
old anyone under 18 is considered a
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
minor a minor in definition is anyone
 
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
who is under the age of full legal
 
00:43:28.109 --> 00:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility or person who is not yet
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
old enough to have the rights of an
 
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
adult a young child cannot understand
 
00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
the full ramifications of a restraining
 
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
order let alone understand how to file
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
one honestly I myself needed assistance
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
from starting point to fill out the
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
petition for the protection order
 
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
because it was so
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
confusing how is it that this law
 
00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
requires minor children to file legal
 
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
documentation on their own when the
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
definition of minor clearly states under
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
the age of full legal responsibility and
 
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
not old enough to have the rights of an
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
adult I am legally responsible for my
 
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
children's safety education shelter food
 
00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
clothing if I were to ignore any of
 
00:44:08.549 --> 00:44:08.559 align:start position:0%
those responsibilities I would be at
 
00:44:10.549 --> 00:44:10.559 align:start position:0%
risk of losing my my children for
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
abuse how is it possible that I
 
00:44:17.549 --> 00:44:17.559 align:start position:0%
responsible for my children's
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
safety yet there's a law that
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
specifically is precluding me from being
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
able to protect my
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
child the abuse that my child suffered
 
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
at the hands of someone who was outside
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
of my household and not a family member
 
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
holds no less I'm
 
00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:41.589 --> 00:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
significance I should be offered the
 
00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:43.079 align:start position:0%
same rights of protection over my
 
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
children as those stated in child
 
00:44:48.549 --> 00:44:48.559 align:start position:0%
protection act RSA 169
 
00:44:51.309 --> 00:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
c7a please help me in fixing this over
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
time would you take questions if there's
 
00:45:00.589 --> 00:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
any I can try well I'm completely out of
 
00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
my element but I'm willing to do
 
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
whatever it takes well I want to confess
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
to you we are too sometimes so anyway
 
00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.430 align:start position:0%
to you we are too sometimes so anyway

any
 
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so much
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
for your story it's very
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
comping J recognizes
 
00:45:20.349 --> 00:45:20.359 align:start position:0%
Joseph B R
 
00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
O give me the last part of your last
 
00:45:32.109 --> 00:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
yeah that one was
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
tough thank you um I'll be brief um I
 
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
sorry um as have been said this you know
 
00:45:48.549 --> 00:45:48.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a mish mash of how the
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
restraining orders work and I'm pretty
 
00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
sure when Jade's law was put in place
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
initially this was done with model
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
legislation from other jurisdictions and
 
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
as often is the case when that happens
 
00:46:02.349 --> 00:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
things don't quite mesh with our laws
 
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
and it ends up with an unintended result
 
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe the legislature ever
 
00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
intended to
 
00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
exclude a whole class of Potential
 
00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
abusers from the option to get a
 
00:46:15.069 --> 00:46:15.079 align:start position:0%
restraining order so I believe this is a
 
00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
very simple solution to fix that and yes
 
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
as said it you know it ends up in a
 
00:46:22.549 --> 00:46:22.559 align:start position:0%
weird act but you know in a weird
 
00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:24.839 align:start position:0%
portion in the rsas but it's the way
 
00:46:26.349 --> 00:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
that the rsas are currently written it's
 
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:27.640 align:start position:0%
really the only way to do it without
 
00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
completely revamping that
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
currently a parent could get a civil
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
restraining order through the superior
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
court system right and solve this at
 
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
Great expense rather than going to the
 
00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
circuit court system so this this puts
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
it in the same system that is currently
 
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
used for restraining orders rather than
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
having to go for a general restraining
 
00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
order at Great expense which would limit
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
the option to only a few members of
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
society who can afford to hire a legal
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
team to
 
00:46:59.069 --> 00:46:59.079 align:start position:0%
obtain a restraining order to protect
 
00:47:02.109 --> 00:47:02.119 align:start position:0%
their child this is the much simpler
 
00:47:04.589 --> 00:47:04.599 align:start position:0%
solution to
 
00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
that I don't think I have much to add
 
00:47:08.109 --> 00:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's a pretty simple
 
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
solution it solves the problem without
 
00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.950 align:start position:0%
solution it solves the problem without
undo

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
undo
 
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
effort Mr Brown would you take questions
 
00:47:20.349 --> 00:47:20.359 align:start position:0%

I would if that's okay you would like to
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
do this yes all right in full
 
00:49:05.549 --> 00:49:05.559 align:start position:0%
disclosure I bought Girl Scout cookies
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
from somebody else yesterday I did that
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
that is okay my girls have aged out
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
already so you're good they have hit
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
Middle School age and they have decided
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
not to continue which is okay with me as
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
long as you support um the community as
 
00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
a whole for Girl Scouts that's I'm a
 
00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
sucker for a s star you know that you
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
know there are a lot of girls out there
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
who have benefited from Girl Scouts and
 
00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:37.640 align:start position:0%
I am glad to see that support in any way
 
00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:39.640 align:start position:0%
possible representative would you think
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
it appropriate that the people who are
 
00:49:44.349 --> 00:49:44.359 align:start position:0%
listening to our dialogue might
 
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
feel compelled to buy some cookies from
 
00:49:49.549 --> 00:49:49.559 align:start position:0%
their Girl Scouts that they
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
know hopefully yes and
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
hopefully encourage those to join as
 
00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
well too represent ative Le levac for a
 
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
motion I move ought to
 
00:50:05.109 --> 00:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
pass okay a republican second because we
 
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
do this representative
 
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
thirds any
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
love thank you Mr chair thanks for uh
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
taking my comments here uh my my only
 
00:50:25.829 --> 00:50:25.839 align:start position:0%
problem is uh the effective date I think
 
00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
it should read immediately after
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah let's get it let's get it
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
across the way yeah but thank
 
00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
you any other comments representative
 
00:50:46.109 --> 00:50:46.119 align:start position:0%
Raymond um thank you Mr chairman I think
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
that there is clearly a gap in the law
 
00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
that was unintended um that is when I
 
00:50:54.109 --> 00:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
heard about this case I was I mean you
 
00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
could have knocked me over with a
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
feather I was flabbergasted that you
 
00:50:58.270 --> 00:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't get a restraining order for
 
00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
your child um having said that I don't
 
00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
think that the child protection statute
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
is the place to do it because Child
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
Protection statute is designed for
 
00:51:10.349 --> 00:51:10.359 align:start position:0%
people who have a caregiving
 
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility so that after a finding
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
they can receive rehabilitative services
 
00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:19.720 align:start position:0%
and reestablish a relationship with that
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
child with the exception of of sexual
 
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
abuse um so I just don't think it's the
 
00:51:26.589 --> 00:51:26.599 align:start position:0%
right place for it I'm going to vote for
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
for it because I think we need to Gap it
 
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
but I would really feel more comfortable
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
if there was a bill or if this bill were
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
amended when it goes along the other
 
00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
side to put the change in language under
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
the other restraining order statutes so
 
00:51:46.829 --> 00:51:46.839 align:start position:0%
that in those circumstances where it is
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
a coach or a neighbor down the road or
 
00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
whomever the parent could file for the
 
00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
minor instead of in 173b where it says
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
now a minor can file for themselves
 
00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
because I feel like that would more
 
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
address the circumstances that we're
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
talking about in the way that um the the
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
relief is being sought if this bill
 
00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
passes all the way through and is signed
 
00:52:11.069 --> 00:52:11.079 align:start position:0%
into law we can bring back something on
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
this subject next year the prohibition
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
is only if it's to the negative and I
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
really don't anticipate that so um I bet
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
you could find somebody who would do
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
just that to not make new law but put
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
them where they belong okay anybody
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
else motion before us is OTP ought to
 
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:34.760 align:start position:0%

01:06:17.549 --> 01:06:17.559 align:start position:0%
Melissa blasic up with me when I
 
01:06:19.950 --> 01:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill would that be okay
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
so she gets legislative alumna points
 
01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
The Honorable Melissa Blas excuse me I'm
 
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
sorry about that so I'm here to
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill 560 uh I am
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative Melissa Lichfield
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
representing the towns of Brentwood
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
Danville and Fremont uh this bill is not
 
01:06:45.150 --> 01:06:45.160 align:start position:0%
new to the state legislature legisl it
 
01:06:47.789 --> 01:06:47.799 align:start position:0%
has been brought up two times prior
 
01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
actually um and the reason why I've
 
01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
brought up Melissa is because she's got
 
01:06:54.269 --> 01:06:54.279 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of history on this I've
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
served here in the state house um this
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
is my second term non-consecutive and
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
when I was not in I was actually getting
 
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
calls from parents that were very
 
01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about this they were unable to
 
01:07:07.950 --> 01:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
access their children's medical records
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
electronically once they hit the age of
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
13 um they were told that the child had
 
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
to set up their own email uh they
 
01:07:17.109 --> 01:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
couldn't act they couldn't even set up
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
appointments for their children so it's
 
01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
it's morphed into um to quite a lot I've
 
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
talked to quite a lot of people um not
 
01:07:26.349 --> 01:07:26.359 align:start position:0%
only is the feeling that they should
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
have access simply because the parents
 
01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
are the caregivers who knows best how to
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
take care of their children but also um
 
01:07:35.309 --> 01:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
you have the medical bills that are
 
01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
well and I'm yeah I'm anyone name
 
01:07:43.349 --> 01:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
Melissa at the table may speak yeah and
 
01:07:45.269 --> 01:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm going to say full I hate to
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
say this I always just keep it real but
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
I'm Type A and I'm I've got I have a dog
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
that just died at home and a sick kid so
 
01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
here I am and this is why she's she's
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
here to be my quarterback today so thank
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair um so I'm Melissa
 
01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
blasic I'm here representing rebuild NH
 
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh yes as a somebody who does advocate
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
for parental rights this is probably the
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
mo most ubiquitous complaint I get from
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
parents typically when they push back
 
01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
it's let's say a doctor's office about
 
01:08:22.749 --> 01:08:22.759 align:start position:0%
this they're always told this is oh it's
 
01:08:25.709 --> 01:08:25.719 align:start position:0%
required by law so I think that they of
 
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
often think that in state law there's
 
01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
something that says that a child loses
 
01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
loses access to a portal system at age
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
12 which is not true but it is true that
 
01:08:42.669 --> 01:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
the laws have made it tricky for portal
 
01:08:48.669 --> 01:08:48.679 align:start position:0%
systems now to be clear all parents have
 
01:08:53.149 --> 01:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
rights to their child's physical paper
 
01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
medical record and any parent parent who
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
goes and requests their child's physical
 
01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
Pap paper medical record will receive it
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
but they will receive it hand redacted
 
01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
for certain items okay so federal
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
law um title 10 I believe requires that
 
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
children over the age of 12 have access
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
to birth control treatments and
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
addiction services without parental
 
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
consent so those would be things that
 
01:09:24.669 --> 01:09:24.679 align:start position:0%
could be would need to be redacted from
 
01:09:26.349 --> 01:09:26.359 align:start position:0%
medical record
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
and state law um kind of redundantly um
 
01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
requires access to Addiction Services
 
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
and also STD uh testing and treatment so
 
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
those would also be things that needed
 
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
to be redacted when we put this bill in
 
01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
I believe it was actually in 2023 and
 
01:09:49.149 --> 01:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
then we retained it to
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
2024 and then
 
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately it was ited because there was
 
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
word coming down from the federal
 
01:09:59.470 --> 01:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
government that they were going to be
 
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
handling this and that never happened so
 
01:10:06.270 --> 01:10:06.280 align:start position:0%
we're back that's why this bill is in
 
01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:07.950 align:start position:0%
we're back that's why this bill is in
again

01:10:07.950 --> 01:10:07.960 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.830 align:start position:0%
again
um

01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:13.950 --> 01:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
the issues with the portal system
 
01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
supposedly is that it doesn't redact in
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
the same way that a paper document can
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
be redacted and so I think what sort of
 
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
happened is that medical provid writers
 
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
have just felt like this is the simplest
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
solution is to just cut off
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
access um but I mean I don't know about
 
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
your 12-year-old but um most 12year olds
 
01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
are really not capable you can see i' I
 
01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
I've passed around um a couple examples
 
01:10:44.669 --> 01:10:44.679 align:start position:0%
of hos of policies from different
 
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
doctor's offices some even specify that
 
01:10:51.669 --> 01:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
the child cannot um use the parents
 
01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
email address so now your child has to
 
01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
have their own email address now of
 
01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:56.830 align:start position:0%
have their own email address now of
course

01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
course
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
listen most parents are going to set up
 
01:11:01.630 --> 01:11:01.640 align:start position:0%
an email address for their child that
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
they have full access to you would think
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
um to do it that way but this is just
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
something that parents come to me all
 
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
the time and they're just outraged that
 
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
they even have to jump through these
 
01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
hoops to be able to have full parental
 
01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
access to their child's medical records
 
01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
most people are not seeing paper we all
 
01:11:24.669 --> 01:11:24.679 align:start position:0%
have the portals that's how they keep
 
01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
track of things so um that is the
 
01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill that's sort of the
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
history of this bill and why we are back
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
today I'll take any questions thank you
 
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
very much uh as a preface a brief
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
preface to my question uh I am part-time
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
a medical center
 
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
CEO and uh one of our providers is my
 
01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
wife who's a family practice physician
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
and very often we discover that Hippa
 
01:11:55.229 --> 01:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
those sacred five letters are invoked
 
01:11:57.669 --> 01:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
when Hippa doesn't say what it's being
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
invoked to it is a brush off in some
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
cases and therefore would you believe
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
that sometimes people already have more
 
01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:09.400 align:start position:0%
rights but maybe we better put more into
 
01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
statute I would absolutely believe that
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
boy that was a push question wow okay
 
01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
chairman um I have two things one I did
 
01:12:21.229 --> 01:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
not get your hand out I don't know where
 
01:12:23.709 --> 01:12:23.719 align:start position:0%
it I just have one copy of some policies
 
01:12:25.229 --> 01:12:25.239 align:start position:0%
floating around that I I have
 
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
highlighted out the children's policies
 
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
and then there's another handout that uh
 
01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:30.280 align:start position:0%
representative Lichfield put out of the
 
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
things that are sort of required in
 
01:12:34.189 --> 01:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
different statutes there are copies of
 
01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
that okay so if maybe it could be
 
01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
emailed to the committee I would love to
 
01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:39.950 align:start position:0%
emailed to the committee I would love to
see

01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
it there there are copies no I have that
 
01:12:44.629 --> 01:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
one I don't have the other one oh the
 
01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
other one the co the copies of the
 
01:12:48.149 --> 01:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
policies yeah I I have one copy of
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
several policies floating around
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative Malone since you are
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
caring for the sign it is not necessary
 
01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
for you to take on other difficulties
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you Mr chair
 
01:12:59.470 --> 01:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
representative Greg can I ask my
 
01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
question though you may ask your
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr I did see your
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
hand okay thank you my question is
 
01:13:09.550 --> 01:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
regarding line 19 line 19 of your bill
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh says when a healthc care provider has
 
01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:13.400 align:start position:0%
determined by and I'm going to use air
 
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
quotes here clear and convincing
 
01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
evidence based upon articulated facts
 
01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:21.400 align:start position:0%
blah blah etc etc um then they can
 
01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
withhold the record yeah my question is
 
01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
where did that language come from from
 
01:13:29.229 --> 01:13:29.239 align:start position:0%
because RSA 169c and every Child
 
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
Protection Law in every state of the
 
01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
country says that the duty of the
 
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
practitioner is if they have reasonable
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
cause to suspect and every state in the
 
01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
country says for a finding of abuse and
 
01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
neglect so for a court to determine a
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
parent is abusive it's a preponderance
 
01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
of the evidence so where did this clear
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
and convincing random level come from
 
01:13:58.149 --> 01:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question I did not
 
01:13:59.790 --> 01:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
write this this is a word for word the
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
bill that was put in before I personally
 
01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
object to this particular part and I
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
would like that section to be stricken
 
01:14:11.149 --> 01:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
if I'm just that would be my personal
 
01:14:13.709 --> 01:14:13.719 align:start position:0%
preference um I think that if a medical
 
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
professional does have any type of
 
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
thought that the child is um possibly
 
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
being abused or neglected they are
 
01:14:25.629 --> 01:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporters and um they
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
that that's how this happens medic they
 
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
are not judges and juries to be able to
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
remove people's parental
 
01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
rights so there there is an amendment in
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
the works but I just wanted to let you
 
01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
know the reason why the bill is wed the
 
01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
way that it is is because they've tried
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
to put this
 
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
bill through two times prior and they
 
01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
were concerns about if they didn't have
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
this language was the bill going to make
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
it past the Finish Line it's just as
 
01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
simple as that but you're 100%
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely right it is not necessary and
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment out
 
01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
there thank you because I that's what
 
01:15:05.470 --> 01:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
killed it the last two times it was here
 
01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
it's that
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
phrase representative Greg thank you Mr
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
and presenting the bill and taking my
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
question so I are there cases where
 
01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
parents are not able so you're talking
 
01:15:21.629 --> 01:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
about the online like the chart and
 
01:15:23.669 --> 01:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
stuff I have a daughter that just turned
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
18 it was until she turned 18 that she
 
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
had to sign like a a release or whatever
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
if she wanted me to be able to continue
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
to do it that's when my email got shut
 
01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
down same uh with my son who's now 21 it
 
01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't until he turned 18 that I was no
 
01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
longer able to access it with what I had
 
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
before so is that actually
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
happening uh thank you for the question
 
01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean when I was researching I
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't find a major practice that did
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
not have a policy that you lost portal
 
01:15:57.390 --> 01:15:57.400 align:start position:0%
access at 12 um I I stopped printing
 
01:15:59.910 --> 01:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
them off cuz they were all the same um
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
and and so yeah no I and I haven't
 
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
that's interesting that you say that CU
 
01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
I I haven't found that to be the case I
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
mean my daughter is at a very small
 
01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
practice that's not associated with any
 
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
major hospital and that's their policy
 
01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
as well um so
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
yeah followup or second question it's a
 
01:16:25.950 --> 01:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
second question um so it's a
 
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
it's a would you believe I suppose so I
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
I make no secret that I'm a Survivor of
 
01:16:31.950 --> 01:16:31.960 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and as well as my
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
children are would you believe that one
 
01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
of the first things um that my late
 
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
husband did when he was taken out of the
 
01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
home was to try to access their medical
 
01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
records before we had findings before we
 
01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
had protection orders or anything else
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
um to see if they were talking about
 
01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:48.760 align:start position:0%
something that he'd
 
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
done sure I would believe that I I
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
believe that's why section B is in here
 
01:16:56.669 --> 01:16:56.679 align:start position:0%
but I I would like to point out that
 
01:16:58.870 --> 01:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is specifically directed
 
01:17:02.669 --> 01:17:02.679 align:start position:0%
toward electronic records so in that
 
01:17:05.149 --> 01:17:05.159 align:start position:0%
case unfortunately if he were to go in
 
01:17:09.149 --> 01:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
person he would have access to their
 
01:17:12.629 --> 01:17:12.639 align:start position:0%
records um I read in line 8 physical
 
01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
medical records and yes electronic
 
01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
medical records yes it's both so it is
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
both it is it is both yes but currently
 
01:17:24.110 --> 01:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
they would be we just put it in there to
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
keep it clean but currently they can
 
01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
have access that that's federal law do
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
you want to follow up okay any else
 
01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
question for the representative and the
 
01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
removed thank you Melissa thank you
 
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody else named Melissa who
 
01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify seeing none
 
01:18:04.629 --> 01:18:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman esteemed
 
01:18:09.070 --> 01:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
colleagues members of the public I am

francistown I'm also the CEO of a
 
01:18:19.470 --> 01:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
healthc care startup cost cures which I
 
01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
co-founded with an emergency medicine
 
01:18:24.189 --> 01:18:24.199 align:start position:0%
physician I'm here to testify in support
 
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
of HB
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
560 relative to parental access to minor
 
01:18:31.390 --> 01:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
and child's medical records I feel this
 
01:18:33.629 --> 01:18:33.639 align:start position:0%
bill is needed to ensure that minor
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
Children's Health Care is properly
 
01:18:37.709 --> 01:18:37.719 align:start position:0%
coordinated by providing essential
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
access to minor Children's Medical
 
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
Records by parents except in certain
 
01:18:44.590 --> 01:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances when it is not in the best
 
01:18:47.229 --> 01:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
interest of the child the bill clearly
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
spells out these exceptions which I will
 
01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
not repeat for the sake of
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
brevity one of the problems the bill
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
seeks to address is a situation in which
 
01:18:58.750 --> 01:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
a minor child receives medication or
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
care without the knowledge of his or her
 
01:19:03.709 --> 01:19:03.719 align:start position:0%
parent and is then treated with
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
contraindicated medication or a
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
procedure that could lead uh or could
 
01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
result in a life-threatening reaction or
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
even death this bill would help avoid
 
01:19:18.149 --> 01:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
these situations I view HB 560 as
 
01:19:20.669 --> 01:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
life-saving legislation and urge you to
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
vote ought to pass thank you are there
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
any questions repres representative

representative

01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um that that
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
actually has been a concern of mine um
 
01:19:40.350 --> 01:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
also with the portal system and I
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
further to what you were saying uh would
 
01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
you say that also medications that are
 
01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
necessary for whatever Health reason um
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
when they are prescribed to a child and
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
the practice of the practice is to
 
01:20:02.709 --> 01:20:02.719 align:start position:0%
request refills via the portal and
 
01:20:04.629 --> 01:20:04.639 align:start position:0%
leaving that responsibility to the minor
 
01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
child could that be harmful for the
 
01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
child if they are not responsible in
 
01:20:12.910 --> 01:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
obtaining uh refills on time I believe
 
01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:13.830 align:start position:0%
obtaining uh refills on time I believe
it

01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
could any other questions for
 
01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy seeing none thank
 
01:20:22.189 --> 01:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
you I appreciate it thank you very much

McFarland he says he's from Orange I
 
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
think he's from south of London just
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
English morning Mr chairman honorable
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
members I'm representative Donald
 
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
mcfallen from Orange and I thank you for
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak in strong
 
01:20:52.270 --> 01:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 560 this testimony
 
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
is uh representing My Views and the
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
views and interests of of my
 
01:20:58.110 --> 01:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
constituents in Grafton 18 my testimony
 
01:21:00.149 --> 01:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
is not made on behalf of any private
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
employer uh nor should it be construed
 
01:21:04.590 --> 01:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
to reflect the views of any of my
 
01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
employers uh it's absurd and outrageous
 
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
that parents who are legally and morally
 
01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
responsible for their children are
 
01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
unable to obtain electronic medical
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
records or are being handed redacted
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
electronic medical records when they are
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
seeking essential information about
 
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
their children's health it's even more
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
absurd and outrageous to learn as we
 
01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
have done earlier in this testimony that
 
01:21:31.950 --> 01:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
healthc care providers are requiring
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
that their children uh that these
 
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
parents' children have their own
 
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
dedicated email address separate from
 
01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
and potentially outside of the
 
01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
supervision of their parents parents are
 
01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
expected to consent to treatment to pay
 
01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
medical bills and to make critical
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
Health Care decisions on behalf of their
 
01:21:51.229 --> 01:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
children yet they are being denied full
 
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
access to the very records that inform
 
01:21:55.629 --> 01:21:55.639 align:start position:0%
those decisions this is not just
 
01:21:57.870 --> 01:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic nonsense it is dangerous
 
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
how can a parent ensure proper follow-up
 
01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
care understanded diagnosis or even
 
01:22:05.149 --> 01:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
recognize potential medical errors when
 
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
they are blocked from seeing key details
 
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
in their child's medical history the
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
idea that parents are being treated as
 
01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
Outsiders in their own Children's Health
 
01:22:15.629 --> 01:22:15.639 align:start position:0%
Care is an insult to both parental
 
01:22:18.189 --> 01:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
rights and to Common Sense House Bill
 
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
560 corrects this Injustice and ensures
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
that parents can fulfill their
 
01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities without unnecessary and
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
arbitrary barriers I urge the committee
 
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
to restore sanity and transparency by
 
01:22:33.070 --> 01:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
recommending this bill for passage thank
 
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
you for your time and consideration and
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions
 
01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
questions to the representative
 
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative Greg I'm just confused
 
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman obviously I'm
 
01:22:45.790 --> 01:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
really confused and uh thank you for
 
01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm confused as to
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
where the having young adults right now
 
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
that were just children where is this
 
01:22:55.149 --> 01:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
happening I've had to consent to
 
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
everything that they've had done
 
01:22:59.229 --> 01:22:59.239 align:start position:0%
medically um I've had to sign off on
 
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
that I've been able to get every medical
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
record without it being redacted like
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
where do you have specific is there
 
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
somebody here maybe that you know that's
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
going to testify where this has actually
 
01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:10.639 align:start position:0%
happened so I I think you already heard
 
01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
precisely that testimony and uh my
 
01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
understanding in talking with some of
 
01:23:17.550 --> 01:23:17.560 align:start position:0%
the other Representatives let alone
 
01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
constituents who are supporting this
 
01:23:22.750 --> 01:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
legislation is that in circumstances
 
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
that they have been seeking precisely
 
01:23:26.990 --> 01:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
these records as you've heard they have
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
been denied them or they have been given
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
redacted records so uh if I am somehow
 
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
misunder understanding your question I
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
apologize but I I think you've already
 
01:23:39.629 --> 01:23:39.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
that representative rice thank you Mr
 
01:23:45.709 --> 01:23:45.719 align:start position:0%
chairman would you believe that if it
 
01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
happens to one person it's too many and
 
01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
this is just good legislation I most
 
01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:52.830 align:start position:0%
this is just good legislation I most
certainly

01:23:52.830 --> 01:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
would any other questions questions
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you chair recognizes Ben Bradley
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:11.950 --> 01:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
Association thank you thank you Mr
 
01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
chairman good morning um my name is Ben
 
01:24:16.830 --> 01:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
Bradley I'm the vice president of state
 
01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
government relations for the New
 
01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital Association I
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
represent all 26 of the Community
 
01:24:24.030 --> 01:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
Hospitals in New Hampshire as well as
 
01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
also specialty hospitals um want to
 
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
and maybe provide some clarity or
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
Insight um we do have concerns about HP
 
01:24:35.189 --> 01:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
560 but I want to state that we
 
01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
completely agree with the general
 
01:24:39.629 --> 01:24:39.639 align:start position:0%
statement uh of purpose of the bill the
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
vast majority of P parents absolutely
 
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
are acting in their child's best
 
01:24:46.229 --> 01:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
interests already do have access to
 
01:24:48.109 --> 01:24:48.119 align:start position:0%
their child's medical record in some
 
01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
fashion and are responsible for
 
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
providing and continuing uh coordinating
 
01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
Medical Care
 
01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
however um the bill as written does have
 
01:24:59.709 --> 01:24:59.719 align:start position:0%
raises some questions for us I'd like to
 
01:24:59.719 --> 01:25:01.870 align:start position:0%
raises some questions for us I'd like to
outline

01:25:01.870 --> 01:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
outline
 
01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:03.430 align:start position:0%
outline
those

01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
um it does appear to resemble previous
 
01:25:09.109 --> 01:25:09.119 align:start position:0%
legislation as was mentioned uh and we
 
01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
continue to believe that it's
 
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
unnecessary as uh Hippa already covers
 
01:25:15.870 --> 01:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
when a med Minor's medical record can be
 
01:25:18.270 --> 01:25:18.280 align:start position:0%
released uh rather than layer on
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
additional regulations that raise
 
01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
serious questions about and
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
complications we recommend the committee
 
01:25:26.910 --> 01:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
vote um an expedient to legislate as you
 
01:25:28.149 --> 01:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
have in the
 
01:25:31.149 --> 01:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
past a particular concern and what was
 
01:25:34.030 --> 01:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
talked about previously was uh online
 
01:25:36.669 --> 01:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
nine including the words including
 
01:25:39.390 --> 01:25:39.400 align:start position:0%
records available via online patient
 
01:25:42.189 --> 01:25:42.199 align:start position:0%
portals um to define the medical record
 
01:25:45.709 --> 01:25:45.719 align:start position:0%
this way creates a technology standard
 
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
that currently cannot be met by many
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
providers in the State uh the bill
 
01:25:52.990 --> 01:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
acknowledges in section 2A that there
 
01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
are records protect under federal state
 
01:25:57.390 --> 01:25:57.400 align:start position:0%
and state laws that parents are not able
 
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
to see without their child's consent
 
01:26:02.590 --> 01:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
such as substance abuse treatment
 
01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
sexually transmitted disease treatment
 
01:26:06.910 --> 01:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
reproductive health services and for
 
01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:08.189 align:start position:0%
reproductive health services and for
emancipated

01:26:08.189 --> 01:26:08.199 align:start position:0%
emancipated
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
minors technology limitations of many of
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
the provids patient portal systems are
 
01:26:16.629 --> 01:26:16.639 align:start position:0%
not capable of the nuanced parsing of
 
01:26:19.390 --> 01:26:19.400 align:start position:0%
the medical record to redact these
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
protected services and therefore we
 
01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
would provide a hard copy or some other
 
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
access uh some other means to the
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate information under the
 
01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:30.189 align:start position:0%
appropriate information under the
medical

01:26:30.189 --> 01:26:30.199 align:start position:0%
medical
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
record additionally I want to point out
 
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
um under the protective orders clause in
 
01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
section 2B uh it does raise many
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
questions about the implementation and
 
01:26:41.590 --> 01:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
puts healthare providers in a position
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
to interpret complex legal documents and
 
01:26:46.270 --> 01:26:46.280 align:start position:0%
postures of the court for one
 
01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
preliminary protective orders can be
 
01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
issued without advanced notice to
 
01:26:53.590 --> 01:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
another party so for example one party
 
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
could uh ask for a protective order it
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
could be issued temporarily or
 
01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
preliminarily and the other party
 
01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even know while the subject of
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
the protective order is entitled to a
 
01:27:06.750 --> 01:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
hearing to challenge the allegations
 
01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
that can be days after the initial
 
01:27:12.109 --> 01:27:12.119 align:start position:0%
order um is the initial order sufficient
 
01:27:14.590 --> 01:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
to trigger this law or is it after a
 
01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
contested hearing protective orders also
 
01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
expire so what happens if an order
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
expires but nobody tells the healthcare
 
01:27:25.470 --> 01:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
provider which may be situation likely
 
01:27:28.350 --> 01:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
to occur what about bail conditions that
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
include no contact orders would that be
 
01:27:33.189 --> 01:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
included under this law how would
 
01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
providers know when the case is resolved
 
01:27:38.430 --> 01:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
and therefore the order is no longer
 
01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
valid um what about sentencing orders
 
01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
and other things that would make it
 
01:27:45.709 --> 01:27:45.719 align:start position:0%
difficult for the provider to
 
01:27:45.719 --> 01:27:47.310 align:start position:0%
difficult for the provider to
comply

01:27:47.310 --> 01:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
comply
 
01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
um there's typically no paperwork that
 
01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
affirmatively says a case is resolved
 
01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
and the bail conditions are prob
 
01:27:57.310 --> 01:27:57.320 align:start position:0%
conditions are lifted so what would be
 
01:27:59.830 --> 01:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
sufficient documentation for providers
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
to lift the denial of
 
01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:04.639 align:start position:0%
access um taking the above into
 
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
consideration if the protective order is
 
01:28:08.629 --> 01:28:08.639 align:start position:0%
no longer valid but nobody tells the
 
01:28:11.229 --> 01:28:11.239 align:start position:0%
healthc care provider and the hospital
 
01:28:13.629 --> 01:28:13.639 align:start position:0%
denies access to a parent the hospital
 
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
would be in violation of federal
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
information blocking rules the proposed
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
language puts the healthcare provider
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
and the hospital in an untenable
 
01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
position of having to essentially do a
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
deep dive into court orders protective
 
01:28:29.229 --> 01:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
orders bail instructions Etc and so they
 
01:28:31.189 --> 01:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
can only act on official information
 
01:28:33.310 --> 01:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
that has been presented to them at the
 
01:28:35.950 --> 01:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
time of the medical records requests
 
01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
finally in the last section um we
 
01:28:41.109 --> 01:28:41.119 align:start position:0%
believe this is also unnecessary as is
 
01:28:42.910 --> 01:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
the case with respect to all personal
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
Representatives under Hippa a provider
 
01:28:47.470 --> 01:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
may choose not to treat a parent as a
 
01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
personal representative when the
 
01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
provider reasonably believes in his or
 
01:28:53.470 --> 01:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
her professional judgment that the child
 
01:28:55.470 --> 01:28:55.480 align:start position:0%
has been may be subject to domestic
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
violence abuse neglect or that that
 
01:29:00.990 --> 01:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
treating the parent as the child's
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
personal representative could endanger
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
the child given these concerns we're not
 
01:29:08.189 --> 01:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
able to support HP 560 but I'm happy to
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
work with anybody or try to answer any
 
01:29:12.990 --> 01:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative D
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
01:29:20.350 --> 01:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
question uh I'm a parent of three a
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
grandparent of
 
01:29:25.109 --> 01:29:25.119 align:start position:0%
four I
 
01:29:25.119 --> 01:29:27.390 align:start position:0%
four I
cannot

01:29:27.390 --> 01:29:27.400 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
01:29:31.709 --> 01:29:31.719 align:start position:0%
imagine not being told by a pediatrician
 
01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
who I trusted with my children's care
 
01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
that there were issues with my child
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
that my child needed help can you tell
 
01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:43.400 align:start position:0%
me why this makes sense for a physician
 
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
not to tell a parent that their child
 
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
has a substance abuse problem where they
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
could overdose and die at night whether
 
01:29:54.430 --> 01:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
they have any other issues that need
 
01:29:57.070 --> 01:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
medical attention where does it make
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
sense that it's okay not to tell the
 
01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:02.639 align:start position:0%
parent I think there are existing
 
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
statute that outlines uh the limitations
 
01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:08.719 align:start position:0%
of that and the rights provided to uh
 
01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
minors at a certain age to protect that
 
01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
information I can't speak to the the
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
policy reasoning but I know that that is
 
01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
the case and has been for a long time
 
01:30:20.590 --> 01:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
much representative rice thank you Mr
 
01:30:26.109 --> 01:30:26.119 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
so can you please tell me what doctor's
 
01:30:31.149 --> 01:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
offices do now if there is a protective
 
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
order that's brought in is this
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
something they can't comprehend I don't
 
01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
understand why that would be difficult
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
do they want I mean if that protective
 
01:30:43.149 --> 01:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
order runs runs out now it's still going
 
01:30:45.629 --> 01:30:45.639 align:start position:0%
to run out who's who's telling them and
 
01:30:48.149 --> 01:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
and what is the policy no I think they
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
they act on the information that is
 
01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
presented to them um I think this
 
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
statute does
 
01:30:59.390 --> 01:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
um nail down the uh qualifications in a
 
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
way that makes it clear especially if as
 
01:31:05.149 --> 01:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
I mentioned the protective order goes
 
01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
away and nobody's told the provider how
 
01:31:09.229 --> 01:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
are they to know that the patient the
 
01:31:12.270 --> 01:31:12.280 align:start position:0%
parent now does have access so I will
 
01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
just reiterate that they act on the
 
01:31:17.629 --> 01:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
information that's provided to them to
 
01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
their best of their ability and
 
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
assume that the parent is acting in the
 
01:31:24.430 --> 01:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
best interest of of the parent of the
 
01:31:26.590 --> 01:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
patient of the minor child unless
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
there's some indication otherwise their
 
01:31:30.430 --> 01:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
professional judgment or some
 
01:31:32.910 --> 01:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
information is presented to them I think
 
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
the bill as it's written just outlines
 
01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
some um broad swath circumstances that
 
01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
just make it a little more difficult uh
 
01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
than simply their ability to take the
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
information that they have and be able
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
to make a determination as to whether uh
 
01:31:58.189 --> 01:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:58.199 --> 01:32:00.229 align:start position:0%
 
access

01:32:00.229 --> 01:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
access
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.430 --> 01:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
so I don't I'm I'm having trouble
 
01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
connecting this because if a parent
 
01:32:12.669 --> 01:32:12.679 align:start position:0%
comes in with the with the protective
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
order yet say it's good for a year it
 
01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
expires but they don't come back and
 
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
tell the The Physician you're still
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
having that same problem that's true
 
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
thank you true this codifies that
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:33.669 --> 01:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
law representative
 
01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
Petrino thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:32:38.109 --> 01:32:38.119 align:start position:0%
for taking my question certainly um if
 
01:32:40.149 --> 01:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing this correctly I think a big
 
01:32:43.590 --> 01:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
concern uh is the portal and that
 
01:32:46.229 --> 01:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
technology uh at the moment is not
 
01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
capable of redacting certain information
 
01:32:51.669 --> 01:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
that by law needs to be redacted but
 
01:32:54.669 --> 01:32:54.679 align:start position:0%
true parents still have access
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
with a hard copy if requested is that
 
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
correct hard copy and electronically by
 
01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
means that are outside of the portal in
 
01:33:05.310 --> 01:33:05.320 align:start position:0%
a way that record a record could be sent
 
01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
to them electronically but also redacted
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
appropriately uh to be in compliance
 
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
with the existing statute thank you very
 
01:33:16.990 --> 01:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
much representative Nelson thank you Mr
 
01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
question um the this um idea uh this
 
01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
problem of Technology not catching up to
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
um the the desires of many parents in
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
the state has come up uh several times
 
01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
in the past uh are you aware of any
 
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
fixes to the current software that would
 
01:33:41.189 --> 01:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
address this
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
issue um there may be developments in
 
01:33:46.990 --> 01:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
the future I'm not aware of those but um
 
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
at this point all I can testify to is
 
01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
the technology
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
limitations uh that aren't able to parse
 
01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:00.040 align:start position:0%
itself representative Raymond thank you
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
question if this bill were to pass with
 
01:34:06.910 --> 01:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
the language changes to align the burden
 
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
of proof to what everything else is um
 
01:34:12.430 --> 01:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
what would the hospital system do for
 
01:34:14.229 --> 01:34:14.239 align:start position:0%
their portal would they simply say
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
portals aren't available for teenagers
 
01:34:20.189 --> 01:34:20.199 align:start position:0%
anymore or would they be like invest
 
01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
millions in developing the technology I
 
01:34:25.550 --> 01:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
think it's a good good question um in
 
01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
order to be in compliance with the law
 
01:34:30.910 --> 01:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
if the portal hasn't kept up or become
 
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
capable of parsing out um the protected
 
01:34:38.669 --> 01:34:38.679 align:start position:0%
information then I would assume which is
 
01:34:41.229 --> 01:34:41.239 align:start position:0%
a risky thing to do uh I would assume
 
01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
that uh it would be difficult to provide
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
access to the portal altogether um but
 
01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
as I said I think providers do make
 
01:34:51.310 --> 01:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
every effort when a medical record
 
01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
request is made to provide the
 
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate access it may not just not
 
01:34:58.990 --> 01:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
be um through the patient portal which
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
is for the which is for the individual's
 
01:35:06.990 --> 01:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
medical you know
 
01:35:09.709 --> 01:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
use thank
 
01:35:12.430 --> 01:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
you seeing no further questions thank
 
01:35:14.189 --> 01:35:14.199 align:start position:0%
you so much Mr Bradley thank you Mr
 
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
chair and most everybody else on a pink
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
card has asked to speak for three
 
01:35:21.790 --> 01:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
minutes and so given the time uh we will
 
01:35:24.790 --> 01:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
put the three minute rule in if uh
 
01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
numbers of these people can do it in
 
01:35:28.270 --> 01:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
three the rest of you can too and one of
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
the best speeches I heard in this room
 
01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
was 47 seconds long needless to say I
 
01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
didn't give it the chair recognizes
 
01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
Cassandra Sanchez from the office of
 
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:47.109 --> 01:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
cour good morning once again for the
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
record Cassandra Sanchez child advocate
 
01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire um and
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
yes we are passing out some written test
 
01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
testimony um I am here before you in
 
01:36:00.270 --> 01:36:00.280 align:start position:0%
opposition of House Bill
 
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
560 um some of the points have been
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
touched on already particularly the um
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence is very
 
01:36:10.030 --> 01:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
concerning um to hold uh medical
 
01:36:12.629 --> 01:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
providers to that standard um so I won't
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
drown on about that um but also another
 
01:36:18.990 --> 01:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
concern um that I hold for this bill is
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
that um when we were talking about
 
01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
medical records this is also inclusive
 
01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh not only of the the safe space that
 
01:36:26.350 --> 01:36:26.360 align:start position:0%
children should have with their medical
 
01:36:28.669 --> 01:36:28.679 align:start position:0%
providers but this is also inclusive of
 
01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
therapeutic records because those are
 
01:36:33.149 --> 01:36:33.159 align:start position:0%
considered Med medical records um it is
 
01:36:35.310 --> 01:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
really important for children to have a
 
01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
space where they can share about what is
 
01:36:39.709 --> 01:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
happening in their lives to adults that
 
01:36:42.750 --> 01:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
can act protectively for them um
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
doctor's offices I can speak from
 
01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679 align:start position:0%
personal experience whenever I bring my
 
01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
child to the doctor's office they have a
 
01:36:49.149 --> 01:36:49.159 align:start position:0%
conversation right in front of my face
 
01:36:50.910 --> 01:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
asking are you safe what is happening in
 
01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
your home has there been any domestic
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
violence that is important conversations
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
to really assess whether the child is
 
01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
safe in their home environment and when
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
they reach a certain age um and have the
 
01:37:04.270 --> 01:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
Privacy to do that with their medical
 
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
professional it may not rise to level
 
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect but it may be something
 
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
noteworthy that goes into their chart
 
01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
and with parents having direct access
 
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
that could become a dangerous situation
 
01:37:14.189 --> 01:37:14.199 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:37:16.669 --> 01:37:16.679 align:start position:0%
child I also want to share um an
 
01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
experience that we had in a a case um
 
01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
that we were overseeing for DCF um so
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
you may already be aware but I want to
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
make sure it is very clear that um
 
01:37:29.629 --> 01:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
parents who have their children removed
 
01:37:34.030 --> 01:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
from their Care by the division maintain
 
01:37:36.149 --> 01:37:36.159 align:start position:0%
their rights which means they still have
 
01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
access and they still are in
 
01:37:39.669 --> 01:37:39.679 align:start position:0%
decision-making roles of their children
 
01:37:41.669 --> 01:37:41.679 align:start position:0%
when it comes to medical um and
 
01:37:44.109 --> 01:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
educational 30 seconds and what that
 
01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
means is that they have direct access to
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
their medical records we had a parent
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
that had a founded allegation against
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
them for abuse of their child and that
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
very parent was using the access to the
 
01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
medical records through the online
 
01:37:59.109 --> 01:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
system to continue to manipulate that
 
01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
child although that child was in the
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
care of the division the division can
 
01:38:04.870 --> 01:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
bring these things to court in which
 
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
they ultimately did but it is not
 
01:38:09.149 --> 01:38:09.159 align:start position:0%
immediate so in that interim this parent
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
was manipulating this child was
 
01:38:13.229 --> 01:38:13.239 align:start position:0%
canceling out providers and removing
 
01:38:14.830 --> 01:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
releases so the child was not receiving
 
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate care was accessing
 
01:38:18.669 --> 01:38:18.679 align:start position:0%
medications and removing the child from
 
01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
medications without the appropriate
 
01:38:22.189 --> 01:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
tapering down from the medication that's
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
required by the medical professional
 
01:38:25.070 --> 01:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
to the point that the medical
 
01:38:26.709 --> 01:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
professionals themselves said they could
 
01:38:28.510 --> 01:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
no longer treat that child because the
 
01:38:30.109 --> 01:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
level of manipulation and control that
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
was happening was so dangerous that they
 
01:38:33.870 --> 01:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
did not feel it was appropriate for them
 
01:38:36.270 --> 01:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
to provide care to that child so this
 
01:38:39.189 --> 01:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
also happens to our children in
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
care questions
 
01:38:45.070 --> 01:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
for The Advocate you're going to have to
 
01:38:47.470 --> 01:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
turn your mic back on representative
 
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
Raymond thank you Mr chairman and uh
 
01:38:50.910 --> 01:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming to speak to us
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
about this I I didn't realize until
 
01:38:55.070 --> 01:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
until you said it that this would apply
 
01:38:57.589 --> 01:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
to therapeutic records and so my
 
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
question is about um a Supreme Court
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
case in reberg uh New Hampshire 658
 
01:39:07.510 --> 01:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
2005 um which talks about how parents
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
don't it was a Supreme Court decision so
 
01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
parents don't have the right to a
 
01:39:15.229 --> 01:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
child's confidential therapeutic records
 
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
would this bill override that Supreme
 
01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:19.629 align:start position:0%
would this bill override that Supreme
Court

01:39:19.629 --> 01:39:19.639 align:start position:0%
Court
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
case it would um or be in conflict with
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
it it would be in conflict with that and
 
01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
I do believe my understanding and if I
 
01:39:28.990 --> 01:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
misspeak please somebody correct me but
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that um once
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
legislation is changed after that the
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
legisl the new legislation would Trump
 
01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
decision any other
 
01:39:44.189 --> 01:39:44.199 align:start position:0%
questions for The Advocate seeing none
 
01:39:48.189 --> 01:39:48.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:51.480 align:start position:0%

I'm the New Hampshire Medical Society
CEO

01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
CEO
 
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
um and I'm here to speak in opposition
 
01:40:57.950 --> 01:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
of House Bill
 
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
560 um I want to State clearly first of
 
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
all that Physicians value the role that
 
01:41:05.189 --> 01:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
parents play in the treatment team the
 
01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
care and the protection of minors um the
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
society however has concerns that as
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
proposed this legislation would
 
01:41:14.669 --> 01:41:14.679 align:start position:0%
interfere with the physician patient
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
relationship under Hippa parents already
 
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
have access to the miners medical
 
01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
records and exceptions under the federal
 
01:41:25.070 --> 01:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
law address important safety needs of
 
01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
the miners in effectively balancing the
 
01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:29.560 align:start position:0%
needs of Guardians with those of miners
 
01:41:32.430 --> 01:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
who need protection and additional
 
01:41:34.709 --> 01:41:34.719 align:start position:0%
confidentiality again in the majority of
 
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
cases parents are
 
01:41:40.109 --> 01:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
valued in valued part of the minor
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
healthc care team when considering this
 
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
bill our physicians were concerned that
 
01:41:46.910 --> 01:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
under the bill some some vulnerable
 
01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
miners who could not be guaranteed a
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
level of confidentiality would either
 
01:41:54.510 --> 01:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
avoid or delay medical or Behavioral
 
01:41:57.589 --> 01:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
Health Care delays in physical health
 
01:42:00.390 --> 01:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
care often result in more complicated
 
01:42:03.629 --> 01:42:03.639 align:start position:0%
and more costly Medical Care sometimes
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
resulting in irreparable health issues
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
as a result I want to also highlight the
 
01:42:10.669 --> 01:42:10.679 align:start position:0%
impact that this bill could have on
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Care of minors
 
01:42:14.350 --> 01:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
confidentiality is Paramount to
 
01:42:16.270 --> 01:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
treatment and for treatment to be
 
01:42:18.109 --> 01:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
effective the patient must be able to
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
disclose behaviors thoughts and feelings
 
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
without fear of judgment or punishment
 
01:42:26.109 --> 01:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
imagine how intimidating it would be to
 
01:42:28.350 --> 01:42:28.360 align:start position:0%
worry that what you said um would be
 
01:42:31.149 --> 01:42:31.159 align:start position:0%
revealed to those who you would want to
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
not to disclose that information too um
 
01:42:35.669 --> 01:42:35.679 align:start position:0%
this committee is responsible for the
 
01:42:37.950 --> 01:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
laws that govern many of New Hampshire's
 
01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable populations I believe
 
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
that the additional barriers in this
 
01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:47.070 align:start position:0%
that the additional barriers in this
bill

01:42:47.070 --> 01:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:42:50.669 --> 01:42:50.679 align:start position:0%
um to New Hampshire's most vulnerable
 
01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
populations um
 
01:42:55.629 --> 01:42:55.639 align:start position:0%
I'm so
 
01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
sorry I believe that the physicians in
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
our communities are are vital to
 
01:43:02.430 --> 01:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
protection of this population and I urge
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
you not to support measures that would
 
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
effectively increase barriers to
 
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
physical and behavioral health care
 
01:43:10.709 --> 01:43:10.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and
 
01:43:13.070 --> 01:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
consideration of my testimony thank you
 
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
do you take questions representative
 
01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman and thanks
 
01:43:20.709 --> 01:43:20.719 align:start position:0%
for taking my call
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
um not taking into consider
 
01:43:25.229 --> 01:43:25.239 align:start position:0%
consideration therapeutic or other
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
things that we talked about that needed
 
01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
to be redacted I'm a little bit confused
 
01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
because um how would this become more
 
01:43:35.790 --> 01:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
dangerous when a parent can at any time
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
ask ask for um hard copies um so what
 
01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
would be the difference between
 
01:43:45.669 --> 01:43:45.679 align:start position:0%
obtaining um information that is
 
01:43:48.870 --> 01:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
currently um acceptable to obtain
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
through hard copy versus that of online
 
01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:53.950 align:start position:0%
through hard copy versus that of online
p

01:43:53.950 --> 01:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
p
 
01:43:56.109 --> 01:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
information I didn't I didn't address
 
01:43:58.030 --> 01:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
the hard copy it was more I was I was
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
talking to the burden of proof um where
 
01:44:04.390 --> 01:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
a physician a a a minor may not feel
 
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
like they would have the confidentiality
 
01:44:08.189 --> 01:44:08.199 align:start position:0%
to come in to address certain physical
 
01:44:12.990 --> 01:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:16.719 align:start position:0%
you representative love thank you Mr
 
01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:44:21.109 --> 01:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
question um I guess this is a would you
 
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
believe would you believe that many many
 
01:44:27.149 --> 01:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
many prescribed drugs uh lead to lead to
 
01:44:30.750 --> 01:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
abuse of of uh similar drugs uh for
 
01:44:33.589 --> 01:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
instance Aderall um you know my my
 
01:44:36.030 --> 01:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
daughter was was was prescribed Aderall
 
01:44:37.589 --> 01:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
in the seventh or eighth grade and by
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
the time she was a a sophomore in high
 
01:44:41.950 --> 01:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
school her and all her friends that were
 
01:44:44.669 --> 01:44:44.679 align:start position:0%
uh were prescribed it also crushing them
 
01:44:46.950 --> 01:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
up and snorting them uh she took us on a
 
01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
7-year run uh smok and crack and ended
 
01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
up doing heroin it was a a run through
 
01:44:54.510 --> 01:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
hell and uh don't you think that the
 
01:44:57.149 --> 01:44:57.159 align:start position:0%
parents should have had I mean my my
 
01:44:59.070 --> 01:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
ex-wife thought it was okay I wouldn't
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
have approved don't you think I should
 
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
have had a little bit of say in this and
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
I wasn't entitled to to it uh that's a
 
01:45:08.830 --> 01:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
could you comment on it I'm very Touched
 
01:45:11.470 --> 01:45:11.480 align:start position:0%
By Your Story um and I and I worked for
 
01:45:13.149 --> 01:45:13.159 align:start position:0%
several years in the
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
recovery field um with um actually
 
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
medical professionals who recovering
 
01:45:24.270 --> 01:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
from abuse um you know I'm not involved
 
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:45:27.950 --> 01:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
patient relationship so I'm not sure
 
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
that I can speak to that right now um
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
and and again we're not here to to put
 
01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
barriers we're here to protect the our
 
01:45:40.830 --> 01:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
our vulnerable populations the children
 
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
um and and you know again I'm so sorry
 
01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:47.830 align:start position:0%
um and and you know again I'm so sorry
for

01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
that followup question representative
 
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
love wouldn't it be safe to say that
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
12 to 17 year old children make bad Mist
 
01:46:01.149 --> 01:46:01.159 align:start position:0%
bad decisions uh you know G given the
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
the uh if if they're given
 
01:46:07.470 --> 01:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
narcotics to to uh for any reason
 
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
whatsoever uh don't you think that they
 
01:46:10.990 --> 01:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
make bad decisions and they should be
 
01:46:14.270 --> 01:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
should have both parents making helping
 
01:46:17.149 --> 01:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
them I will leave that I I can't
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
disagree as a parent of of three adult
 
01:46:21.790 --> 01:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
children um who have made some
 
01:46:23.550 --> 01:46:23.560 align:start position:0%
questionable decisions
 
01:46:26.229 --> 01:46:26.239 align:start position:0%
um you know I will say that again we're
 
01:46:27.910 --> 01:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
here to speak to those vulnerable
 
01:46:30.149 --> 01:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
populations and I and I can't speak to
 
01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
the situation of why a physician in in
 
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
this particular situation wouldn't have
 
01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
disclosed it or what what the
 
01:46:41.070 --> 01:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
particulars are um you know we value the
 
01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
role of parents and our physicians
 
01:46:47.589 --> 01:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
really want to engage with parents um
 
01:46:49.790 --> 01:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
we're speaking about maybe that small
 
01:46:51.950 --> 01:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
percentage of children who actually who
 
01:46:53.950 --> 01:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
very much need
 
01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:56.870 align:start position:0%
very much need
that

01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
confidentiality representative Raymond
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question um kind of along the
 
01:47:07.109 --> 01:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
I the lines of things that are already
 
01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
protected and redacted as per state law
 
01:47:11.870 --> 01:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
like substance abuse and reproductive
 
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
Health choices um would this
 
01:47:20.270 --> 01:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
bill be in would this bill prohibit
 
01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
practitioners in mass in New Hampshire
 
01:47:25.229 --> 01:47:25.239 align:start position:0%
from following the state law that
 
01:47:27.669 --> 01:47:27.679 align:start position:0%
requires those things to be
 
01:47:31.070 --> 01:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
redacted I'm not an attorney I think we
 
01:47:32.910 --> 01:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
would have to consult an attorney as to
 
01:47:34.750 --> 01:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
what which would preempt and what how
 
01:47:36.629 --> 01:47:36.639 align:start position:0%
this would play out I I can't speak to
 
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Coen thank you Mr
 
01:47:48.030 --> 01:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for uh being here
 
01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
to answer our questions um I just want
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
to ask you your opinion is is it more
 
01:47:57.229 --> 01:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
important that we prioritize the patient
 
01:47:59.270 --> 01:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
doctor relationship over the parent
 
01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:03.790 align:start position:0%
doctor relationship over the parent
child

01:48:03.790 --> 01:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:06.510 --> 01:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
relationship thank you for the question
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to it's you guys are
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
hitting me hard today um these are these
 
01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
are very very challenging questions and
 
01:48:15.229 --> 01:48:15.239 align:start position:0%
I think I will tell you that the
 
01:48:18.030 --> 01:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
Physicians that that I spoke with in
 
01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
regards to this
 
01:48:25.189 --> 01:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
um don't take these decisions lightly
 
01:48:28.229 --> 01:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
and they think very carefully um I can't
 
01:48:28.239 --> 01:48:29.550 align:start position:0%
and they think very carefully um I can't
get

01:48:29.550 --> 01:48:29.560 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:48:32.669 --> 01:48:32.679 align:start position:0%
into what the nuances of of Any Given
 
01:48:35.790 --> 01:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
decision or or you know I think that
 
01:48:39.390 --> 01:48:39.400 align:start position:0%
there there are good questions that are
 
01:48:42.830 --> 01:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
coming out here um and as a parent I
 
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to be involved and and again I
 
01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
will say I was always asked for my
 
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
permission and and I was never denied
 
01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
access to my kids records um and and and
 
01:48:56.189 --> 01:48:56.199 align:start position:0%
I can understand that in certain
 
01:48:59.589 --> 01:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
circumstances um you know you as
 
01:49:02.229 --> 01:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
legislators might might question that
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
but I think having the ability to to act
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
protectively is important you know we
 
01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
don't want to look back and say oh gosh
 
01:49:12.149 --> 01:49:12.159 align:start position:0%
that level of protection should have
 
01:49:14.350 --> 01:49:14.360 align:start position:0%
been afforded to that child because now
 
01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
there's been a devastating consequence
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
so I think we're coming at it
 
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
conservatively from a patient and
 
01:49:27.390 --> 01:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
testimony if she's comfortable with it
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
could you answer that question where a
 
01:49:40.510 --> 01:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:44.270 --> 01:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
needed neither am I thank
 
01:49:53.109 --> 01:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:55.470 --> 01:49:55.480 align:start position:0%

my testimony appreciate that making one
 
01:50:21.870 --> 01:50:21.880 align:start position:0%
thank you sir um so for the record my
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
name is Jim k
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
I uh represent Hillsboro District 32 uh
 
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
representing the towns of Wilton Temple
 
01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
and new ipswitch um so I am uh quite
 
01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
familiar with this uh issue we had this
 
01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
bill uh two years ago in health and
 
01:50:41.589 --> 01:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
human services and um it seems that it
 
01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
is a recurring issue I think at the time
 
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
we had retained the bill and in the
 
01:50:48.069 --> 01:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
hopes that this would be addressed at a
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
federal level um because there was at
 
01:50:52.709 --> 01:50:52.719 align:start position:0%
the time something called the
 
01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
information blocking rule uh under
 
01:50:56.990 --> 01:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
consideration by the office of civil
 
01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
rights which um enforces
 
01:51:04.709 --> 01:51:04.719 align:start position:0%
Hippa um I understand that there are uh
 
01:51:06.669 --> 01:51:06.679 align:start position:0%
challenges there are some technical
 
01:51:08.350 --> 01:51:08.360 align:start position:0%
challenges with implementing something
 
01:51:12.589 --> 01:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
like this having said that um since we
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
have not seen any action at the federal
 
01:51:17.910 --> 01:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
level to um Implement changes that would
 
01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
require parents to have um adequate
 
01:51:22.870 --> 01:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
access to their Children's Medical
 
01:51:25.709 --> 01:51:25.719 align:start position:0%
records and portal access to set
 
01:51:28.030 --> 01:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
appointments for example um I think it's
 
01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
important that we uh move this bill
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
forward in order to affect some change
 
01:51:37.310 --> 01:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
um I spoke to a parent uh just two days
 
01:51:39.709 --> 01:51:39.719 align:start position:0%
ago who called me about this bill and
 
01:51:42.750 --> 01:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
said that um she is actually being told
 
01:51:45.950 --> 01:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
that since her son has turned 12 she no
 
01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
longer has access that neither of them
 
01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
has access to the portal um and she is
 
01:51:57.390 --> 01:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
now unable to make appointments even she
 
01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
she can't just get her son's um
 
01:52:03.229 --> 01:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
credentials and use them and go online
 
01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
and make an appointment there is no
 
01:52:08.950 --> 01:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
access at all and so uh that is creating
 
01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
a a barrier it's creating an
 
01:52:13.390 --> 01:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
inconvenience um I know that parents who
 
01:52:15.870 --> 01:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
want their children's medical records
 
01:52:20.030 --> 01:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
can can get those uh pursuant to Hippa
 
01:52:21.629 --> 01:52:21.639 align:start position:0%
uh but there's an extensive process of
 
01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
redacting information information from
 
01:52:26.750 --> 01:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
that um and making sure that um any
 
01:52:29.790 --> 01:52:29.800 align:start position:0%
protected information that may be
 
01:52:31.910 --> 01:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
safeguarded by federal law state law or
 
01:52:35.589 --> 01:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
both is is redacted so that the Privacy
 
01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
is not um violated 30 seconds um I'll
 
01:52:40.910 --> 01:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
just wrap up I think it's important for
 
01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
us to keep uh to keep the pressure on
 
01:52:45.510 --> 01:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
and move toward a solution and I think
 
01:52:47.229 --> 01:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
this bill helps to do that thank you
 
01:52:48.589 --> 01:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
very much questions for the
 
01:52:51.229 --> 01:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
01:52:53.629 --> 01:52:53.639 align:start position:0%
patrino thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:52:54.830 --> 01:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
01:52:57.149 --> 01:52:57.159 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned parents uh
 
01:52:59.149 --> 01:52:59.159 align:start position:0%
inability to make appointments for their
 
01:53:01.589 --> 01:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
children uh they still able to pick up a
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
telephone and make a call to schedule an
 
01:53:06.589 --> 01:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
appointment um thank you for the
 
01:53:06.599 --> 01:53:08.270 align:start position:0%
appointment um thank you for the
question

01:53:08.270 --> 01:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:53:12.069 --> 01:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
so if if the provider or facility is
 
01:53:16.030 --> 01:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
taking appointments by phone yes um I
 
01:53:17.790 --> 01:53:17.800 align:start position:0%
was told by this particular parent that
 
01:53:19.589 --> 01:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
she is being directed to use a
 
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
smartphone she does not have a
 
01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
smartphone um
 
01:53:25.030 --> 01:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
to make the appointment so I am not
 
01:53:27.069 --> 01:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
familiar with the the particular
 
01:53:28.589 --> 01:53:28.599 align:start position:0%
mechanism that they were asking her to
 
01:53:30.990 --> 01:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
use it was not the patient portal it was
 
01:53:33.149 --> 01:53:33.159 align:start position:0%
something else um and there's some
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
frustration that this is um causing her
 
01:53:39.189 --> 01:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
to jump through some additional
 
01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:41.679 align:start position:0%
Hoops thank you
 
01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative chair
 
01:53:47.950 --> 01:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
recognizes I'm going to say
 
01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:49.669 align:start position:0%
recognizes I'm going to say
Viking

01:53:49.669 --> 01:53:49.679 align:start position:0%
Viking
 
01:53:52.229 --> 01:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
Hedberg my norwegian's a bit Rusty how
 
01:53:53.709 --> 01:53:53.719 align:start position:0%
did I
 
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
do quite well actually Viking is not a
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
real name in Sweden but it's was my
 
01:54:02.109 --> 01:54:02.119 align:start position:0%
grandfather's you're Swedish I so no the
 
01:54:03.870 --> 01:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
I I beg your pardon there's an issue
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
across the L yes I do and I appreciate
 
01:54:09.310 --> 01:54:09.320 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to come before you today
 
01:54:10.750 --> 01:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
I am a pediatrician who's been
 
01:54:12.870 --> 01:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
practicing in New Hampshire since
 
01:54:16.189 --> 01:54:16.199 align:start position:0%
1997 I also did after my three-year
 
01:54:18.229 --> 01:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
pediatric residency I also did a
 
01:54:19.629 --> 01:54:19.639 align:start position:0%
three-year Fellowship in adolescent
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
medicine and this issue about privacy is
 
01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:23.950 align:start position:0%
medicine and this issue about privacy is
really

01:54:23.950 --> 01:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
challenging and I'm testifying an
 
01:54:30.350 --> 01:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill um and I hear
 
01:54:33.350 --> 01:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
your concerns very much about parental
 
01:54:35.830 --> 01:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
involvement and there's no way I think
 
01:54:37.950 --> 01:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
clinicians are trying to decrease
 
01:54:40.189 --> 01:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
parental involvement you know I work
 
01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
very hard trying to keep parents
 
01:54:44.350 --> 01:54:44.360 align:start position:0%
involved in productive ways with their
 
01:54:46.390 --> 01:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
kids and building
 
01:54:48.310 --> 01:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
relationships the challenge with this
 
01:54:49.950 --> 01:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
bill well there's two things there's one
 
01:54:52.069 --> 01:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
it's unnecessary because hip is quite
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
clear their parents do have access and
 
01:54:56.109 --> 01:54:56.119 align:start position:0%
the issue trying to be solved
 
01:54:59.390 --> 01:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
legislatively here is one of technology
 
01:55:02.990 --> 01:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
and organizational policy I'm only
 
01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
representing myself but I believe
 
01:55:08.750 --> 01:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock both parent and
 
01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
child has access to the portal but it's
 
01:55:13.709 --> 01:55:13.719 align:start position:0%
able to be separated in Epic their
 
01:55:16.109 --> 01:55:16.119 align:start position:0%
electronic system I work for conquered
 
01:55:19.470 --> 01:55:19.480 align:start position:0%
Hospital which has Cerner which doesn't
 
01:55:21.390 --> 01:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
have that ability so they just shut it
 
01:55:24.229 --> 01:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
down it is is incredibly frustrating
 
01:55:26.229 --> 01:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
it's frustrating to me as a clinician
 
01:55:28.830 --> 01:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
it's frustrating to parents but it's not
 
01:55:31.149 --> 01:55:31.159 align:start position:0%
a legal issue it's an issue of being
 
01:55:34.270 --> 01:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
able to solve the problem the one thing
 
01:55:37.709 --> 01:55:37.719 align:start position:0%
that Hippa has in it that this doesn't
 
01:55:40.669 --> 01:55:40.679 align:start position:0%
is it allows parents
 
01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
to deputize their children to have
 
01:55:47.950 --> 01:55:47.960 align:start position:0%
access now no places doing that but
 
01:55:50.030 --> 01:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
there's no magic when you hit your 18th
 
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
birthday you develop maturity I can tell
 
01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
you a lot of 19-year-old males whose
 
01:55:59.310 --> 01:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
frontal loes I do not trust one bit um
 
01:56:02.189 --> 01:56:02.199 align:start position:0%
so it's a process of development and I
 
01:56:03.990 --> 01:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
think there have to be thoughtful ways
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
within our profession where we gradually
 
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
hand control and ability over to the
 
01:56:11.709 --> 01:56:11.719 align:start position:0%
young people and that's a healthy
 
01:56:14.229 --> 01:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
progress that happens happens in schools
 
01:56:16.589 --> 01:56:16.599 align:start position:0%
happens in communities this half a
 
01:56:18.669 --> 01:56:18.679 align:start position:0%
minute doctor thank you this bill blocks
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
that and it's also unneeded because
 
01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
there is access I'll last leave one
 
01:56:26.189 --> 01:56:26.199 align:start position:0%
other thing is we get asked really
 
01:56:28.790 --> 01:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
bizarre questions in the office I've
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
been asked if I masterbate does my penis
 
01:56:34.350 --> 01:56:34.360 align:start position:0%
get longer and if I was my parent was
 
01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
reading that I think I would be pretty
 
01:56:40.870 --> 01:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
embarrassed so I want to protect privacy
 
01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
I want kids to be able to talk to me
 
01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
without fear that what they say is going
 
01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
to be put verbatim back to the parents
 
01:56:52.589 --> 01:56:52.599 align:start position:0%
one other thing is Cerner is B bought by
 
01:56:54.990 --> 01:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
Oracle they're now going to be using AI
 
01:56:57.709 --> 01:56:57.719 align:start position:0%
to transcribe our visits it's going to
 
01:56:59.069 --> 01:56:59.079 align:start position:0%
open up a
 
01:57:01.870 --> 01:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
whole other issue of what goes into
 
01:57:03.669 --> 01:57:03.679 align:start position:0%
those records and how we edit them
 
01:57:05.470 --> 01:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
doctor will you take questions I would
 
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
be happy to take questions
 
01:57:10.629 --> 01:57:10.639 align:start position:0%
questions representative Raymond uh
 
01:57:12.350 --> 01:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:57:14.709 --> 01:57:14.719 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
01:57:17.950 --> 01:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
so my question is about the technology
 
01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
piece because I was kind of baffled by
 
01:57:21.629 --> 01:57:21.639 align:start position:0%
some of the previous testimony because
 
01:57:24.750 --> 01:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
my child is 16 and I was in his parent
 
01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
portal this his patient portal this
 
01:57:29.270 --> 01:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
weekend reconciling his PT bill with his
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
PT dates being like why are these not
 
01:57:34.069 --> 01:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
the same we figured it out so my
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
question is is there um a is there a
 
01:57:42.589 --> 01:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
cost issue with the various systems like
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
why is there such disparities between
 
01:57:48.270 --> 01:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
these technological systems between
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
hospitals that's a very big question
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
and these systems are huge they're
 
01:57:57.149 --> 01:57:57.159 align:start position:0%
incredibly expensive they're incredibly
 
01:58:00.030 --> 01:58:00.040 align:start position:0%
expensive to implement and they are
 
01:58:02.790 --> 01:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
not necessarily efficient nor designed
 
01:58:05.669 --> 01:58:05.679 align:start position:0%
to do what they actually have to do some
 
01:58:10.669 --> 01:58:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:13.310 --> 01:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
others thank you doctor thank you you
 
01:58:15.109 --> 01:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
may be interested to know I absolutely
 
01:58:17.470 --> 01:58:17.480 align:start position:0%
despise poal and refuse to be on any of
 
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
them could I answer that question that
 
01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
wasn't a question that was a parting
 
01:58:25.709 --> 01:58:25.719 align:start position:0%
shot but sure can I comment on that as
 
01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
the son of a of my father who
 
01:58:34.030 --> 01:58:34.040 align:start position:0%
passed um I had to be on every one of
 
01:58:36.270 --> 01:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
his portals to make sure care was
 
01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate and there were prescrib
 
01:58:39.870 --> 01:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
medicines that were contraindicated
 
01:58:42.109 --> 01:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
including one that was prescribed by a
 
01:58:45.149 --> 01:58:45.159 align:start position:0%
cardiologist that increased his rate of
 
01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
risk of death by
 
01:58:50.830 --> 01:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
50% and if I wasn't diligent he would
 
01:58:53.589 --> 01:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
have been given things that were
 
01:58:56.189 --> 01:58:56.199 align:start position:0%
problematic now it's hard because our
 
01:58:58.149 --> 01:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
health system is really complicated it's
 
01:58:59.830 --> 01:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
really in
 
01:59:03.390 --> 01:59:03.400 align:start position:0%
silos I wish it worked better know but
 
01:59:05.669 --> 01:59:05.679 align:start position:0%
without that portal he would have not
 
01:59:07.830 --> 01:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
been with us nearly the length of time
 
01:59:10.350 --> 01:59:10.360 align:start position:0%
that he was and that I was grateful for
 
01:59:12.669 --> 01:59:12.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Doctor very
 
01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
much what I learned from that is I'll
 
01:59:17.589 --> 01:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
make sure my children are chair
 
01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
recognizes anarie
 
01:59:23.149 --> 01:59:23.159 align:start position:0%
Banfield thank you
 
01:59:28.430 --> 01:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you for the record anary
 
01:59:32.830 --> 01:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
Banfield I'm a parental rights advocate
 
01:59:34.669 --> 01:59:34.679 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and I focus on
 
01:59:36.669 --> 01:59:36.679 align:start position:0%
education but I felt compelled to come
 
01:59:39.669 --> 01:59:39.679 align:start position:0%
to this um this hearing first of all
 
01:59:42.069 --> 01:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
Bedford uh years ago I asked them to put
 
01:59:44.750 --> 01:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
their check registry online and they
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
just did it and they redact everything
 
01:59:49.709 --> 01:59:49.719 align:start position:0%
that needs to be redacted so I'm not
 
01:59:51.390 --> 01:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
sure how a school can do it but a
 
01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
medical facil facility
 
01:59:55.709 --> 01:59:55.719 align:start position:0%
cannot uh insurance companies get our
 
01:59:57.510 --> 01:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
medical records get the medical records
 
01:59:59.109 --> 01:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
and now we're just basically saying no
 
02:00:02.390 --> 02:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
to parents again showing the
 
02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:04.470 align:start position:0%
to parents again showing the
difference

02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
difference
 
02:00:07.350 --> 02:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
um also there was a Supreme Court ruling
 
02:00:09.510 --> 02:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
I think it was Timberlane where they
 
02:00:11.950 --> 02:00:11.960 align:start position:0%
were asking for timberlan schools were
 
02:00:13.589 --> 02:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
asking for electronic records and they
 
02:00:14.709 --> 02:00:14.719 align:start position:0%
had to go to the Supreme Court and
 
02:00:16.350 --> 02:00:16.360 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court said yes you you have to
 
02:00:18.510 --> 02:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
give electronic records if a parent asks
 
02:00:20.790 --> 02:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
for that or somebody files it through a
 
02:00:23.470 --> 02:00:23.480 align:start position:0%
91a um the the term dangerous was
 
02:00:26.310 --> 02:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
brought up and by the way I do get a lot
 
02:00:29.030 --> 02:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
of uh comments from parents about this I
 
02:00:31.030 --> 02:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
had no idea my my adult my children are
 
02:00:33.149 --> 02:00:33.159 align:start position:0%
adults I had no idea that that this was
 
02:00:35.430 --> 02:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
even happening um but because I'm a
 
02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
parental rights Advocate I do hear from
 
02:00:39.430 --> 02:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
parents that they're not able to access
 
02:00:41.589 --> 02:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
this information but we heard the term
 
02:00:44.790 --> 02:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
dangerous it's going to be dangerous to
 
02:00:47.149 --> 02:00:47.159 align:start position:0%
provide this information to parents
 
02:00:48.629 --> 02:00:48.639 align:start position:0%
although they can get it through through
 
02:00:51.270 --> 02:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
electronical record so if a if a child
 
02:00:53.149 --> 02:00:53.159 align:start position:0%
comes in is talking about his penis
 
02:00:54.990 --> 02:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
enlarging they would be able to get it
 
02:00:57.069 --> 02:00:57.079 align:start position:0%
through written records so I'm not sure
 
02:01:00.830 --> 02:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
what what that what that correlation was
 
02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
um but you know I go in and I normally
 
02:01:04.950 --> 02:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
don't share personal information but I
 
02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
go in every 3 months for photomy I've
 
02:01:11.390 --> 02:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
got a blood disorder so my blood's thick
 
02:01:12.550 --> 02:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to describe it in
 
02:01:14.709 --> 02:01:14.719 align:start position:0%
medical terms so I go in every 3 months
 
02:01:16.790 --> 02:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
for photomy because if my hemoglobin
 
02:01:18.390 --> 02:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
level goes up too high and I have a
 
02:01:22.669 --> 02:01:22.679 align:start position:0%
stroke um that would cause more medical
 
02:01:24.350 --> 02:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
problems so if my hemoglobin level is at
 
02:01:27.709 --> 02:01:27.719 align:start position:0%
a certain level um I will if I have a
 
02:01:29.589 --> 02:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
stroke I should be able to survive it in
 
02:01:33.189 --> 02:01:33.199 align:start position:0%
a better way so knowing that my blood
 
02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:35.679 align:start position:0%
has that disorder if my daughter who is
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
now 30 had gone in to seek birth control
 
02:01:42.069 --> 02:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
at an early age and I know that that
 
02:01:44.510 --> 02:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
information's redacted you literally
 
02:01:47.950 --> 02:01:47.960 align:start position:0%
would have put her in life dangering
 
02:01:50.310 --> 02:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
position I can't take birth control I
 
02:01:52.109 --> 02:01:52.119 align:start position:0%
couldn't take birth control cuz that is
 
02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
that's a ticket to stroke and that's a
 
02:01:56.109 --> 02:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
ticket to blood clots and that's a
 
02:01:59.910 --> 02:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
ticket to death so yeah there are simple
 
02:02:04.229 --> 02:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
simple um there are medical problems
 
02:02:06.709 --> 02:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
that people have that if they're cut if
 
02:02:08.030 --> 02:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
if I would have been cut out of the half
 
02:02:10.510 --> 02:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
a minute cut out of the scene you would
 
02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
put her life in
 
02:02:16.229 --> 02:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
danger and my son was in a hospital for
 
02:02:19.750 --> 02:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
2 weeks blood clots everywhere during Co
 
02:02:22.189 --> 02:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
he's lucky to be alive because he had it
 
02:02:26.709 --> 02:02:26.719 align:start position:0%
clearly he clearly has it so my point is
 
02:02:28.030 --> 02:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
you talk about
 
02:02:30.830 --> 02:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
danger you put my daughter on on birth
 
02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
control without running a this blood
 
02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
test and I wouldn't have known I had
 
02:02:36.149 --> 02:02:36.159 align:start position:0%
this blood testc but because I went
 
02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
through a kidney transplant I had to
 
02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
have this blood work done and that's
 
02:02:42.189 --> 02:02:42.199 align:start position:0%
where they found it thank you Miss
 
02:02:45.430 --> 02:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
bfield uh any questions for the witness
 
02:02:48.270 --> 02:02:48.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative Nelson thank you Mr
 
02:02:49.950 --> 02:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
02:02:51.910 --> 02:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
question would you believe you're not
 
02:02:55.030 --> 02:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
the only person who has encountered this
 
02:02:56.229 --> 02:02:56.239 align:start position:0%
issue I
 
02:03:01.390 --> 02:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
myself um took hormones um
 
02:03:05.310 --> 02:03:05.320 align:start position:0%
for change of life uh transition let's
 
02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
say um and I ended up with a saddle
 
02:03:12.669 --> 02:03:12.679 align:start position:0%
pulmonary embolism which is nearly fatal
 
02:03:14.589 --> 02:03:14.599 align:start position:0%
and it's usually not discovered until
 
02:03:18.069 --> 02:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
autopsy and it's vitally important that
 
02:03:18.079 --> 02:03:19.589 align:start position:0%
autopsy and it's vitally important that
my

02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
daughter tells every physician because
 
02:03:25.229 --> 02:03:25.239 align:start position:0%
it is an
 
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
unknown reason why I have this issue
 
02:03:30.669 --> 02:03:30.679 align:start position:0%
although my father and my grandmother
 
02:03:32.750 --> 02:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
have it as well so would you believe
 
02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
that you are not the only person with
 
02:03:38.229 --> 02:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
this issue oh absolutely I mean you you
 
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
talk about a vulnerable population I
 
02:03:42.270 --> 02:03:42.280 align:start position:0%
keep hearing the term vulnerable
 
02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
population what about the vulnerable
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
parents out there that are being cut out
 
02:03:49.069 --> 02:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
what about those parents and what about
 
02:03:50.750 --> 02:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
their children we talk about vulnerable
 
02:03:52.830 --> 02:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
we got to we got a protect these
 
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
vulnerable kids well you're not
 
02:03:57.470 --> 02:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
protecting my daughter with this kind
 
02:04:00.750 --> 02:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
of redacted information question
 
02:04:02.709 --> 02:04:02.719 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
02:04:04.750 --> 02:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
chairman um and thank you would you
 
02:04:07.069 --> 02:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
believe that as a survivor of multiple
 
02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
Strokes I told my 13-year-old daughter
 
02:04:13.549 --> 02:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
about the risks about birth control so
 
02:04:16.629 --> 02:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
that as she transitions into adulthood
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
she can make responsible and intelligent
 
02:04:21.709 --> 02:04:21.719 align:start position:0%
choices and have confidential discussion
 
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
questions with her doctor would you
 
02:04:26.189 --> 02:04:26.199 align:start position:0%
believe that parents have an obligation
 
02:04:28.870 --> 02:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
to parent their children and not leave
 
02:04:30.589 --> 02:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
out important information that would
 
02:04:33.229 --> 02:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
allow their child to
 
02:04:37.030 --> 02:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
survive uh thank you for the question I
 
02:04:40.350 --> 02:04:40.360 align:start position:0%
don't think that the disparaging kind of
 
02:04:42.069 --> 02:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
remarks that you just made in your
 
02:04:46.750 --> 02:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
facial expressions was necessary um but
 
02:04:50.069 --> 02:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
in in addition to that yes I would tell
 
02:04:51.990 --> 02:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
my daughter
 
02:04:53.669 --> 02:04:53.679 align:start position:0%
there's not always the correlation I
 
02:04:56.350 --> 02:04:56.360 align:start position:0%
didn't have a stroke to to share that
 
02:04:58.870 --> 02:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
information thankfully we caught it
 
02:05:01.870 --> 02:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
before that actually happened and yes
 
02:05:05.830 --> 02:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
she's aware now but at the age of 16
 
02:05:07.510 --> 02:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
this is when they were running the tests
 
02:05:10.310 --> 02:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
on me this is when the they were they
 
02:05:11.990 --> 02:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
were finding out this information about
 
02:05:14.910 --> 02:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
me because I had my kidney transplant 14
 
02:05:19.149 --> 02:05:19.159 align:start position:0%
years ago she's 30 now so in that time
 
02:05:22.109 --> 02:05:22.119 align:start position:0%
frame what I've had the the knowledge at
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
that moment maybe not at that moment but
 
02:05:25.750 --> 02:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
maybe at that moment maybe I wouldn't
 
02:05:28.430 --> 02:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
have put it together my point is now
 
02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
that I do know of course my daughter
 
02:05:32.589 --> 02:05:32.599 align:start position:0%
knows my daughter's a nurse practitioner
 
02:05:35.109 --> 02:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
she sees all the people coming in with
 
02:05:37.149 --> 02:05:37.159 align:start position:0%
who who've had covid who have had
 
02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
Strokes who have had blood clots and who
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
understand now that putting them on a
 
02:05:44.549 --> 02:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
birth control pill comes at
 
02:05:47.709 --> 02:05:47.719 align:start position:0%
risk thank you for your testimony chair
 
02:05:53.390 --> 02:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
now recognizes Betty gay former state
 
02:05:55.350 --> 02:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
representative since we're all probably
 
02:05:57.149 --> 02:05:57.159 align:start position:0%
getting hungry at this point I really
 
02:06:01.350 --> 02:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
will be brief okay Betty gay from Salem
 
02:06:04.709 --> 02:06:04.719 align:start position:0%
and six years ago I was presenting well
 
02:06:06.549 --> 02:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
no I didn't even get to present because
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
they double booked me I didn't get to
 
02:06:11.109 --> 02:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
present this law this rule uh bill but
 
02:06:13.310 --> 02:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
this is the third time it's being
 
02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
presented okay we handed out uh some
 
02:06:20.229 --> 02:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
tables that are uh include among other
 
02:06:22.750 --> 02:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
things the Federal
 
02:06:26.709 --> 02:06:26.719 align:start position:0%
confidentiality Rec uh rules so we can't
 
02:06:30.790 --> 02:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
overcome them but we can overcome the
 
02:06:33.870 --> 02:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire confidentiality rules that
 
02:06:38.310 --> 02:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:40.910 --> 02:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
address okay so you have you have that
 
02:06:42.510 --> 02:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
and that's your leisure you can choose
 
02:06:44.990 --> 02:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
which ones are meaningful to you excuse
 
02:06:48.030 --> 02:06:48.040 align:start position:0%
me uh Unfortunately they combined New
 
02:06:49.549 --> 02:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and federal so you have to
 
02:06:51.669 --> 02:06:51.679 align:start position:0%
read it quite carefully to figure out
 
02:06:54.270 --> 02:06:54.280 align:start position:0%
but most of it and I wish my voice would
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
stop shaking but I'm trying to talk
 
02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
really fast
 
02:07:01.189 --> 02:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh okay so for one thing there's a
 
02:07:02.990 --> 02:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
difference between Federal and New
 
02:07:04.510 --> 02:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we're trying to be
 
02:07:08.189 --> 02:07:08.199 align:start position:0%
respectful of the federal but we want to
 
02:07:10.470 --> 02:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
get rid of the New Hampshire
 
02:07:13.189 --> 02:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
confidentiality rules that are being so
 
02:07:16.709 --> 02:07:16.719 align:start position:0%
harmful to families with teens and a lot
 
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
of the issues that are being discussed
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
would apply to Children younger than 1
 
02:07:25.629 --> 02:07:25.639 align:start position:0%
to so some some of the arguments are
 
02:07:28.750 --> 02:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
have holes in them um there are
 
02:07:31.510 --> 02:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
safeguards written into this bill so
 
02:07:35.709 --> 02:07:35.719 align:start position:0%
under Roman numeral 2 B and C definitely
 
02:07:38.470 --> 02:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
give people in Authority who have access
 
02:07:41.350 --> 02:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
to this information the right to prevent
 
02:07:44.109 --> 02:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
parents from accessing it if they think
 
02:07:44.119 --> 02:07:45.709 align:start position:0%
parents from accessing it if they think
it's

02:07:45.709 --> 02:07:45.719 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
dangerous we're also talking about the M
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
Mass majority of children have parents
 
02:07:55.950 --> 02:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
who are responsible and where the
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
hindrances built that are in the system
 
02:08:01.950 --> 02:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
right now are hindering the majority of
 
02:08:04.790 --> 02:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
people rather than be protective of the
 
02:08:07.750 --> 02:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
few kids who really do have parents who
 
02:08:09.750 --> 02:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
somebody should be separating their
 
02:08:14.189 --> 02:08:14.199 align:start position:0%
Authority from the child so both B and C
 
02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
are really really important and refute a
 
02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
lot of the arguments that are being
 
02:08:26.510 --> 02:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:29.189 --> 02:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
um yes I've already said all ages of
 
02:08:31.430 --> 02:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
children some of these arguments apply
 
02:08:35.189 --> 02:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
to so this this bill is not uh doesn't
 
02:08:39.629 --> 02:08:39.639 align:start position:0%
really solve those issues for age um 20
 
02:08:42.270 --> 02:08:42.280 align:start position:0%
seconds clear and convincing evidence
 
02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
definitely can be amended and it sounds
 
02:08:47.229 --> 02:08:47.239 align:start position:0%
like it's going to be there is not only
 
02:08:49.709 --> 02:08:49.719 align:start position:0%
Hippa but furpa which I'm not familiar
 
02:08:53.629 --> 02:08:53.639 align:start position:0%
with but the Federal uh Records cite it
 
02:08:55.750 --> 02:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
as a very important document about
 
02:08:59.669 --> 02:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
children's records
 
02:09:02.430 --> 02:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
um and if an older child needs to let
 
02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
their doctor know something they don't
 
02:09:07.109 --> 02:09:07.119 align:start position:0%
want their parents to hear they've got a
 
02:09:09.549 --> 02:09:09.559 align:start position:0%
telephone also you don't have to put
 
02:09:13.149 --> 02:09:13.159 align:start position:0%
every single thing in a record of these
 
02:09:15.470 --> 02:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
what sounds funny questions of a child
 
02:09:18.030 --> 02:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
asking their doctor that doesn't have to
 
02:09:19.750 --> 02:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
be in the record thank you
 
02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative amerita
 
02:09:24.069 --> 02:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
and uh that you did got a lot of words
 
02:09:25.709 --> 02:09:25.719 align:start position:0%
packed in there I know you normally
 
02:09:28.669 --> 02:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
speak slowly any questions for The
 
02:09:31.629 --> 02:09:31.639 align:start position:0%
Honorable Betty gay representative Greg
 
02:09:33.069 --> 02:09:33.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:09:34.510 --> 02:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
honorable gay for being here and taking
 
02:09:36.109 --> 02:09:36.119 align:start position:0%
my question because you've worked on
 
02:09:37.870 --> 02:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
this legislation numerous times as
 
02:09:39.870 --> 02:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
you've said and you've had it before and
 
02:09:41.669 --> 02:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
we're assuming that the majority of the
 
02:09:43.109 --> 02:09:43.119 align:start position:0%
parents are good parents who have
 
02:09:45.830 --> 02:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
healthy relationships what is it about
 
02:09:48.430 --> 02:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
this bill or what is it about what's
 
02:09:50.990 --> 02:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
happening in the world that these good
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
parents are not able to have
 
02:09:55.350 --> 02:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
conversations about the medical part of
 
02:09:58.350 --> 02:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
the kids' lives and be able to um
 
02:10:00.030 --> 02:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
already see their records and stuff I
 
02:10:01.790 --> 02:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
know that I know that I can I assume I'm
 
02:10:03.510 --> 02:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
an okay parent because I can do all that
 
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
so I'm just wondering what is what is
 
02:10:07.990 --> 02:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
stopping parents from having
 
02:10:11.790 --> 02:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:15.030 --> 02:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
kids I'm thinking about how difficult it
 
02:10:17.709 --> 02:10:17.719 align:start position:0%
is to get your child to get say you have
 
02:10:19.990 --> 02:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
a perfect relationship with your child
 
02:10:22.069 --> 02:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
and they don't know what's protected
 
02:10:23.910 --> 02:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
they don't know that you're that you
 
02:10:25.629 --> 02:10:25.639 align:start position:0%
can't find out if they ask for birth
 
02:10:27.870 --> 02:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
control pills because the federal
 
02:10:30.589 --> 02:10:30.599 align:start position:0%
prohibitions are on that what if they're
 
02:10:33.510 --> 02:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
afraid to tell you and also can you
 
02:10:35.229 --> 02:10:35.239 align:start position:0%
imagine getting your child to give
 
02:10:37.990 --> 02:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
permission to every single provider that
 
02:10:39.950 --> 02:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
they hear and make sure that the
 
02:10:43.069 --> 02:10:43.079 align:start position:0%
communication doesn't break down I I
 
02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
really feel like since you haven't
 
02:10:47.669 --> 02:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
experienced it you're having a hard time
 
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
believing what's happening to most
 
02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:53.510 align:start position:0%
believing what's happening to most
parents

02:10:53.510 --> 02:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:55.990 --> 02:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
follow up would you believe I have
 
02:10:58.390 --> 02:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
experienced this because of my um
 
02:11:01.069 --> 02:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
relationship with my late husband and I
 
02:11:03.270 --> 02:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
do have continual conversations with my
 
02:11:05.990 --> 02:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
children so that they're not scared to
 
02:11:08.549 --> 02:11:08.559 align:start position:0%
talk to me well that's certainly the
 
02:11:10.470 --> 02:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
goal for all of
 
02:11:12.910 --> 02:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
us representative
 
02:11:16.069 --> 02:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr thank you Mr
 
02:11:17.629 --> 02:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
02:11:21.709 --> 02:11:21.719 align:start position:0%
call my call that's twice now but that's
 
02:11:23.950 --> 02:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
good we're really getting hungry here
 
02:11:25.950 --> 02:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
question always do that I don't know why
 
02:11:28.470 --> 02:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
I keep saying that
 
02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
um would you believe that despite my uh
 
02:11:38.589 --> 02:11:38.599 align:start position:0%
warning my daughter about uh the need to
 
02:11:42.589 --> 02:11:42.599 align:start position:0%
discuss um low estrogen or high
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
progesterone birth control with their
 
02:11:48.430 --> 02:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
doctor starting when
 
02:11:51.310 --> 02:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
I thankfully did not pass away from a
 
02:11:54.270 --> 02:11:54.280 align:start position:0%
pulmonary embolism and I kept repeating
 
02:11:57.390 --> 02:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
it to her that when at the age of 15 she
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
went to obtain birth control I had no
 
02:12:05.149 --> 02:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
Knowledge from the doctor of what type
 
02:12:07.669 --> 02:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
of birth control she was
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
on I do believe it and the sad thing is
 
02:12:12.990 --> 02:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
that under federal law you still
 
02:12:15.390 --> 02:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to know that unless
 
02:12:18.310 --> 02:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
unless your daughter told you we can't
 
02:12:20.109 --> 02:12:20.119 align:start position:0%
change the federal law but at least we
 
02:12:23.350 --> 02:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
can change the New Hampshire
 
02:12:27.310 --> 02:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
law thank you thank you
 
02:12:30.990 --> 02:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
question is there any sorry thank you
 
02:12:35.669 --> 02:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:37.990 --> 02:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
call question well you're welcome
 
02:12:41.430 --> 02:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
representative Malone carry
 
02:12:45.790 --> 02:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
on sorry um is there anything preventing
 
02:12:48.750 --> 02:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
parents now whether they have a good
 
02:12:50.790 --> 02:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
relationship or poor relationship with
 
02:12:54.709 --> 02:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
their teenage child to still give the
 
02:12:56.709 --> 02:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
doctor that medical
 
02:12:59.229 --> 02:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
history um that these drugs could be
 
02:13:02.510 --> 02:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
dangerous to my child in the future at 7
 
02:13:05.470 --> 02:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
years old 8 years old 10 years old so
 
02:13:07.709 --> 02:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
that information's already there so the
 
02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
doctor could have that conversation with
 
02:13:12.990 --> 02:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
the child if the child's not listening I
 
02:13:15.790 --> 02:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
don't see anything in this in this bill
 
02:13:18.750 --> 02:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
that would prohibit the parent from
 
02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's just the parent might not know who
 
02:13:27.830 --> 02:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
the child is even seeing until they get
 
02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:29.270 align:start position:0%
the child is even seeing until they get
a

02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:13:33.149 --> 02:13:33.159 align:start position:0%
bill do do we know if that's like a
 
02:13:36.069 --> 02:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
sorry followup that's
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
what do we I don't even know how to
 
02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:41.030 align:start position:0%
what do we I don't even know how to
question

02:13:41.030 --> 02:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:13:45.990 --> 02:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
this do we know how like how often is
 
02:13:48.790 --> 02:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
this like really happening because like
 
02:13:52.390 --> 02:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
again like to me I bring my kid to the
 
02:13:54.990 --> 02:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
doctor and I was there and we had the
 
02:13:57.109 --> 02:13:57.119 align:start position:0%
conversation about birth control for a
 
02:13:58.669 --> 02:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
period cramp she's going to hate that
 
02:14:00.229 --> 02:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
this was
 
02:14:02.310 --> 02:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
bu um
 
02:14:06.629 --> 02:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
but but we had those conversations and I
 
02:14:10.430 --> 02:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
just always remember those providers so
 
02:14:13.390 --> 02:14:13.400 align:start position:0%
are these like oneoff providers like
 
02:14:18.189 --> 02:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
maybe just a a sexual health provider
 
02:14:21.350 --> 02:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
versus their PHP they the person that
 
02:14:27.229 --> 02:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:30.069 --> 02:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
seen I have an experienced it
 
02:14:32.910 --> 02:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunate and I know that right and we
 
02:14:35.470 --> 02:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
think that most people would not if
 
02:14:38.470 --> 02:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
these if these prohibitions were
 
02:14:40.950 --> 02:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
stopped it's just the prohibition is
 
02:14:43.950 --> 02:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
there there's a lot of ignorance implied
 
02:14:47.830 --> 02:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
and um it's just not good parenting to
 
02:14:51.549 --> 02:14:51.559 align:start position:0%
be told your child is now turned 13
 
02:14:54.510 --> 02:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
so you can pay the bills but you really
 
02:14:56.229 --> 02:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
are not supposed to be
 
02:14:58.310 --> 02:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
involved thank
 
02:15:00.790 --> 02:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
02:15:14.990 --> 02:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
Hood thank you Mr chairman members of
 
02:15:18.270 --> 02:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
02:15:19.629 --> 02:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
Matthew Hood I'm the vice president of
 
02:15:21.549 --> 02:15:21.559 align:start position:0%
government relations at Dartmouth health
 
02:15:24.189 --> 02:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
I promise I will be quick
 
02:15:28.790 --> 02:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to start by saying how um
 
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
much value and emphasis the providers uh
 
02:15:34.910 --> 02:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
in the Pediatrics and primary medicine
 
02:15:37.870 --> 02:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
place on the engagement of parents in
 
02:15:42.229 --> 02:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
their children's health um we strongly
 
02:15:45.470 --> 02:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
encourage that uh in a Minor's care and
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
we also want to be mindful of those
 
02:15:48.830 --> 02:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
scenarios where that could either be
 
02:15:51.790 --> 02:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
problematic or is pro prohibited
 
02:15:54.270 --> 02:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
that being said what I was hoping to
 
02:15:56.310 --> 02:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
emphasize for the committee today is
 
02:15:57.790 --> 02:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
things that have already been said so
 
02:16:00.510 --> 02:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
this the differing standards between the
 
02:16:03.589 --> 02:16:03.599 align:start position:0%
federal law um and the state law at
 
02:16:05.589 --> 02:16:05.599 align:start position:0%
least as in the current version of the
 
02:16:07.470 --> 02:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
amendment clear and convincing evidence
 
02:16:08.990 --> 02:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
is something that we would like to work
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
with the committee on uh remedying um
 
02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
because we find compliance with two
 
02:16:15.910 --> 02:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
standards to be a somewhat challenging
 
02:16:19.310 --> 02:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
proposal I think to the um chairs what I
 
02:16:21.229 --> 02:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
heard to be the chairs earlier comment
 
02:16:22.669 --> 02:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
about wanting to provide Clarity with
 
02:16:25.149 --> 02:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
respect to what parents are enabled as
 
02:16:27.109 --> 02:16:27.119 align:start position:0%
well as the parameters about when that's
 
02:16:29.669 --> 02:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
not totally on board with helping to
 
02:16:32.750 --> 02:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
facilitate that process um and
 
02:16:37.070 --> 02:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
finally I can't speak to the portal um
 
02:16:40.230 --> 02:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
my daughter turns 12 in May so I will be
 
02:16:42.709 --> 02:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
able to speak to the portal situation
 
02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
fairly soon I suppose um uh but happy to
 
02:16:48.669 --> 02:16:48.679 align:start position:0%
pursue any uh the answers to that
 
02:16:50.309 --> 02:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
question from the dmouth health
 
02:16:53.830 --> 02:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:57.309 --> 02:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
helpful my sense is that uh there's some
 
02:16:59.190 --> 02:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
good stuff in this Bill Good Intentions
 
02:17:02.309 --> 02:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
and some work needs to be done and it
 
02:17:03.910 --> 02:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful because I don't
 
02:17:06.509 --> 02:17:06.519 align:start position:0%
have access immediately to it to
 
02:17:08.950 --> 02:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
actually have the hip of regulations as
 
02:17:11.910 --> 02:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
they exist and not as people think they
 
02:17:14.150 --> 02:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
exist and that's all over the map and
 
02:17:17.110 --> 02:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
compare contrast to the state rules and
 
02:17:19.549 --> 02:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
um if you want to be an adviser to
 
02:17:23.509 --> 02:17:23.519 align:start position:0%

02:17:26.230 --> 02:17:26.240 align:start position:0%

02:17:34.230 --> 02:17:34.240 align:start position:0%

right across the street you can almost
 
03:07:40.990 --> 03:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
see it from here um in September of
 
03:07:46.070 --> 03:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
2023 NPR ran a a story entitled kids get
 
03:07:49.389 --> 03:07:49.399 align:start position:0%
the bill for their own f F care and
 
03:07:53.990 --> 03:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
Nationwide 5 to 10% of children in
 
03:07:56.469 --> 03:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
Children and Youth in foster care
 
03:07:59.429 --> 03:07:59.439 align:start position:0%
qualify for Social Security disability
 
03:08:01.110 --> 03:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
or survivors
 
03:08:03.670 --> 03:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
benefits these are children who have had
 
03:08:07.590 --> 03:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
a parent that died or a parent who is
 
03:08:11.710 --> 03:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
disabled or a child who themselves has a
 
03:08:15.429 --> 03:08:15.439 align:start position:0%
disability Across the Nation including
 
03:08:18.670 --> 03:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the state have retained
 
03:08:21.110 --> 03:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
these benefits when a child goes into
 
03:08:25.070 --> 03:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
foster care but that is changing many
 
03:08:27.229 --> 03:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
states are moving to preserve the
 
03:08:29.950 --> 03:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
benefits for the foster child making
 
03:08:32.670 --> 03:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
sure benefits are held securely for the
 
03:08:36.269 --> 03:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
child until they are no longer in care
 
03:08:39.590 --> 03:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
last year I brought in House Bill
 
03:08:42.150 --> 03:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
1598 which would have change the New
 
03:08:44.110 --> 03:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire practice of the state
 
03:08:46.429 --> 03:08:46.439 align:start position:0%
retaining the child's benefits to
 
03:08:48.910 --> 03:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
reimburse the state date for the child's
 
03:08:51.429 --> 03:08:51.439 align:start position:0%
care this committee overwhelmingly
 
03:08:53.830 --> 03:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
passed the legislation and when it
 
03:08:56.590 --> 03:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
reached the finance committee there were
 
03:08:59.349 --> 03:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
many questions from both legislators and
 
03:09:02.229 --> 03:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
state Personnel on how the new policy
 
03:09:02.239 --> 03:09:03.510 align:start position:0%
state Personnel on how the new policy
would

03:09:03.510 --> 03:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:09:08.389 --> 03:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
work so House Bill 1598 from last year
 
03:09:10.790 --> 03:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
was amended to provide the Department of
 
03:09:13.150 --> 03:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services with funding
 
03:09:16.670 --> 03:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
to hire a consultant to develop a report
 
03:09:18.750 --> 03:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
and a roadmap appap as to how New
 
03:09:22.030 --> 03:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can implement this polic new
 
03:09:25.630 --> 03:09:25.640 align:start position:0%
policy in December of 2024 just a couple
 
03:09:28.990 --> 03:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
of months ago the report entitled child
 
03:09:31.510 --> 03:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
centered benefits management assessment
 
03:09:34.190 --> 03:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
was completed and provides New Hampshire
 
03:09:36.590 --> 03:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
with the information and process needed
 
03:09:38.070 --> 03:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
to enact this
 
03:09:41.670 --> 03:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
policy I have made copies of the
 
03:09:44.870 --> 03:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
findings from the findings pages of the
 
03:09:46.950 --> 03:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
report for each of you and I've got one
 
03:09:50.110 --> 03:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
for for all of you um and I'm leaving a
 
03:09:52.670 --> 03:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
copy of the full report with your
 
03:09:56.469 --> 03:09:56.479 align:start position:0%
committee to um and I'd be glad if any
 
03:09:59.590 --> 03:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
of you want your own copy of this I
 
03:10:01.670 --> 03:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
would be glad to make a copy of it and
 
03:10:05.710 --> 03:10:05.720 align:start position:0%
and get it to you um I would like to
 
03:10:08.190 --> 03:10:08.200 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to pass this
 
03:10:11.030 --> 03:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
legislation so it can go to the finance
 
03:10:13.190 --> 03:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
committee the finance committee
 
03:10:17.429 --> 03:10:17.439 align:start position:0%
obviously worked on this bill last year
 
03:10:20.309 --> 03:10:20.319 align:start position:0%
and made a decision to put in a sizable
 
03:10:22.510 --> 03:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
amount of money to hire a national
 
03:10:25.190 --> 03:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
consultant to come in and help New
 
03:10:27.429 --> 03:10:27.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with what would need what
 
03:10:29.630 --> 03:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
would need to happen in order for this
 
03:10:32.190 --> 03:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
uh policy to take place so the bill
 
03:10:35.269 --> 03:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
really needs to be in finance so that
 
03:10:38.309 --> 03:10:38.319 align:start position:0%
Finance can continue to explore this
 
03:10:40.910 --> 03:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
policy so I believe the hurdle for this
 
03:10:44.870 --> 03:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
bill is um a financial one and it needs
 
03:10:46.870 --> 03:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
to go to the house finance committee and
 
03:10:49.229 --> 03:10:49.239 align:start position:0%
I hope you will vote to move the bill
 
03:10:51.710 --> 03:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
along there are many people here today
 
03:10:54.030 --> 03:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
who can provide testimony on the bill
 
03:10:56.349 --> 03:10:56.359 align:start position:0%
including at least one young person the
 
03:10:59.790 --> 03:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
state policy has affected you will hear
 
03:11:01.670 --> 03:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
that the difference what a difference
 
03:11:04.429 --> 03:11:04.439 align:start position:0%
these benefits will make in the lives of
 
03:11:07.790 --> 03:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
children leaving foster care I recently
 
03:11:10.389 --> 03:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
visited a homeless shelter in Manchester
 
03:11:13.590 --> 03:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
that is for youth ages 18 to
 
03:11:17.269 --> 03:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
24 and the staff told us that about 40%
 
03:11:19.870 --> 03:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
% of the young people in the shelter
 
03:11:22.349 --> 03:11:22.359 align:start position:0%
have been in the State Trial protection
 
03:11:26.229 --> 03:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
system foster care or in residential
 
03:11:28.309 --> 03:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
placement think of the difference it
 
03:11:30.990 --> 03:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
would make in the lives of young people
 
03:11:34.190 --> 03:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
if their benefit have been preserved so
 
03:11:38.110 --> 03:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
that when they enter adult life with
 
03:11:41.070 --> 03:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
they will have a chance of going to
 
03:11:44.469 --> 03:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
college having a place to live affording
 
03:11:47.510 --> 03:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
a car so they can get employment being
 
03:11:51.750 --> 03:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
in state custody is hard enough for a
 
03:11:53.910 --> 03:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
child sorry about
 
03:11:57.870 --> 03:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
that without without losing the benefits
 
03:11:59.870 --> 03:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
that provide them a safety net as they
 
03:12:02.670 --> 03:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
enter adulthood so I hope that I can
 
03:12:06.229 --> 03:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
urge you to pass this on so that we can
 
03:12:09.030 --> 03:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
have a discussion in finance about of
 
03:12:11.590 --> 03:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
the financial issues around this bill
 
03:12:14.190 --> 03:12:14.200 align:start position:0%
and the details to how we would put this
 
03:12:17.349 --> 03:12:17.359 align:start position:0%
in place notwithstanding the motto
 
03:12:20.150 --> 03:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
finances where good bills go to die it
 
03:12:22.590 --> 03:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
would seem that uh Finance has done a
 
03:12:25.429 --> 03:12:25.439 align:start position:0%
wonderful job upfront so when it comes
 
03:12:28.269 --> 03:12:28.279 align:start position:0%
back to them they should be quite
 
03:12:31.710 --> 03:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
excited that was a would you believe yes
 
03:12:35.110 --> 03:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
I would believe that they yeah I'm going
 
03:12:38.670 --> 03:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
to hand out um the findings pages so I
 
03:12:41.309 --> 03:12:41.319 align:start position:0%
have one for each of you and I also have
 
03:12:45.550 --> 03:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
um um the report I for the clerk okay
 
03:12:47.630 --> 03:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
good thank you so I will bring this up I
 
03:12:50.550 --> 03:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
I will answer questions if you have any
 
03:12:53.110 --> 03:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:55.790 --> 03:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
representative representative Raymond
 
03:12:57.110 --> 03:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:12:58.590 --> 03:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
representative wner for taking my
 
03:13:01.229 --> 03:13:01.239 align:start position:0%
question um so I was trying to remember
 
03:13:03.070 --> 03:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
last year all the discussions we had
 
03:13:05.670 --> 03:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
about this spill um and one of the the
 
03:13:07.070 --> 03:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
questions that I had last year and I
 
03:13:09.950 --> 03:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
still have is about um circumstances
 
03:13:13.349 --> 03:13:13.359 align:start position:0%
where the child's parent or some other
 
03:13:16.150 --> 03:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
relative is already the paye for the
 
03:13:17.790 --> 03:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
social security benefit benefits and is
 
03:13:20.510 --> 03:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
using that money to pay for things like
 
03:13:22.429 --> 03:13:22.439 align:start position:0%
the family's rent so that the child has
 
03:13:25.389 --> 03:13:25.399 align:start position:0%
a place to come back would this bill
 
03:13:28.229 --> 03:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
interfere with that process and then
 
03:13:30.670 --> 03:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
secondarily if the circumstance were to
 
03:13:32.710 --> 03:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
arise where the pay ends up being
 
03:13:36.990 --> 03:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
changed to the state um well just that
 
03:13:38.429 --> 03:13:38.439 align:start position:0%
one would that one would they interfere
 
03:13:38.439 --> 03:13:40.710 align:start position:0%
one would that one would they interfere
with

03:13:40.710 --> 03:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:45.070 --> 03:13:45.080 align:start position:0%
it well it would it would mean that the
 
03:13:47.389 --> 03:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
the benefits would be preserved for the
 
03:13:49.269 --> 03:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
child by the state and the state would
 
03:13:52.870 --> 03:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
no longer take those benefits for the
 
03:13:55.750 --> 03:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
state's uh reimbursement for the for the
 
03:13:58.469 --> 03:13:58.479 align:start position:0%
Foster Care you will see that there is
 
03:14:01.269 --> 03:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
one difference one small difference in
 
03:14:05.269 --> 03:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
this bill than there was last time and
 
03:14:08.469 --> 03:14:08.479 align:start position:0%
we added and I don't have the bill up
 
03:14:12.030 --> 03:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
here with me but we did add a section
 
03:14:15.950 --> 03:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
that refers to if a child goes into
 
03:14:19.150 --> 03:14:19.160 align:start position:0%
foster care and they already have a paye
 
03:14:20.590 --> 03:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
might be a
 
03:14:25.590 --> 03:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
relative um a family friend um a
 
03:14:27.750 --> 03:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
grandparent it you know if the child
 
03:14:30.309 --> 03:14:30.319 align:start position:0%
already has a pay and the state
 
03:14:33.309 --> 03:14:33.319 align:start position:0%
determines that that is an appropriate
 
03:14:37.429 --> 03:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
pay they could retain that paye okay dur
 
03:14:40.030 --> 03:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
while they are in foster care and that
 
03:14:43.710 --> 03:14:43.720 align:start position:0%
would avoid the state taking the the uh
 
03:14:45.950 --> 03:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
Social Security payment so thank you
 
03:14:48.070 --> 03:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
that's where I was trying to go follow
 
03:14:50.990 --> 03:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
um so in that circumstance would the
 
03:14:53.349 --> 03:14:53.359 align:start position:0%
would that pay still have the ability to
 
03:14:56.110 --> 03:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
use those funds to maintain the child's
 
03:14:58.750 --> 03:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
existing you know household of origin or
 
03:15:01.510 --> 03:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
does that pay then have to create um a
 
03:15:03.070 --> 03:15:03.080 align:start position:0%
savings account for the child with those
 
03:15:05.150 --> 03:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
funds I think that I think that would be
 
03:15:07.950 --> 03:15:07.960 align:start position:0%
something that I would imagine that the
 
03:15:09.630 --> 03:15:09.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:15:12.550 --> 03:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
would work out with the pay I mean in
 
03:15:12.560 --> 03:15:13.790 align:start position:0%
would work out with the pay I mean in
some

03:15:13.790 --> 03:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:15:17.389 --> 03:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
circumstances If the child has had these
 
03:15:21.630 --> 03:15:21.640 align:start position:0%
Social Security payments and the family
 
03:15:25.189 --> 03:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
is very lowincome and they they may be
 
03:15:26.870 --> 03:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
using part of the child's Social
 
03:15:29.389 --> 03:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
Security to help pay their rent if you
 
03:15:32.229 --> 03:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
really want to reunify the family you
 
03:15:34.269 --> 03:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
don't want to impoverished them in such
 
03:15:36.510 --> 03:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
a way that they couldn't accept the
 
03:15:42.349 --> 03:15:42.359 align:start position:0%
child back into the family so this could
 
03:15:45.630 --> 03:15:45.640 align:start position:0%
benefit the reunification of families by
 
03:15:47.670 --> 03:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
being sure that those resources are
 
03:15:50.590 --> 03:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
preserved with the family thank you
 
03:15:52.030 --> 03:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
that's what I was trying to get clarity
 
03:15:54.469 --> 03:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
on thank you any further questions for
 
03:15:57.349 --> 03:15:57.359 align:start position:0%

much and uh you know every one of these
 
03:16:05.510 --> 03:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
cards with two exceptions says you want
 
03:16:07.429 --> 03:16:07.439 align:start position:0%
to speak for three minutes and the two
 
03:16:10.030 --> 03:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
exceptions say two minutes and since
 
03:16:11.630 --> 03:16:11.640 align:start position:0%

03:16:39.990 --> 03:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
question for representative
 
03:16:46.990 --> 03:16:47.000 align:start position:0%

03:17:11.349 --> 03:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
one H good afternoon chairman Pearson
 
03:17:12.830 --> 03:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee I'm Karen
 
03:17:14.750 --> 03:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg I'm the policy director of the
 
03:17:16.030 --> 03:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center of New
 
03:17:18.550 --> 03:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we are here in strong
 
03:17:20.990 --> 03:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
support of this spell as you've heard
 
03:17:25.309 --> 03:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
from representative walner um HB 661
 
03:17:27.630 --> 03:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
would require the department of um
 
03:17:30.670 --> 03:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services to help um
 
03:17:32.950 --> 03:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
parents apply for benefits for their
 
03:17:34.950 --> 03:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
children or apply for federal benefits
 
03:17:37.030 --> 03:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
for children in their custody and then
 
03:17:39.189 --> 03:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
require that those benefits you be
 
03:17:41.790 --> 03:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
conserved they could be used for current
 
03:17:44.389 --> 03:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
needs that exceed what our foster care
 
03:17:46.870 --> 03:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
system generally covers for children
 
03:17:48.990 --> 03:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
which for children with disabilities
 
03:17:50.710 --> 03:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
could be things like extra supports and
 
03:17:53.229 --> 03:17:53.239 align:start position:0%
rest bit in the family home the Foster
 
03:17:55.670 --> 03:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
family home um that aren't generally
 
03:17:58.269 --> 03:17:58.279 align:start position:0%
covered by the regular foster care
 
03:18:00.189 --> 03:18:00.199 align:start position:0%
benefit or system or not covered by
 
03:18:02.349 --> 03:18:02.359 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um it would also require the
 
03:18:04.110 --> 03:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
department to allow those benefits to be
 
03:18:06.349 --> 03:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
conserved for the child um for their
 
03:18:09.110 --> 03:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
future use for children who are have
 
03:18:11.830 --> 03:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
disabilities and are eligible for SSI or
 
03:18:14.870 --> 03:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
supplemental security income that is a
 
03:18:17.389 --> 03:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
um income-based disability program
 
03:18:19.389 --> 03:18:19.399 align:start position:0%
um for children and adults but it has a
 
03:18:22.150 --> 03:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
resource limit um those funds could
 
03:18:23.830 --> 03:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
could be conserved in an account called
 
03:18:25.790 --> 03:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
an able account or sometimes referred to
 
03:18:28.670 --> 03:18:28.680 align:start position:0%
as a stable account very easy to use
 
03:18:31.750 --> 03:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
every our state has one and that the
 
03:18:34.070 --> 03:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
money could be safe for future use and
 
03:18:36.710 --> 03:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
without impacting a child's eligibility
 
03:18:38.990 --> 03:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
for continuing SSI
 
03:18:41.349 --> 03:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
benefits the reasons we think this is
 
03:18:44.110 --> 03:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
really important policy for our children
 
03:18:47.030 --> 03:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
is that we expect significant ly
 
03:18:50.389 --> 03:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
improved outcomes for children who have
 
03:18:54.510 --> 03:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
um contact with the Foster or the um DCF
 
03:18:56.790 --> 03:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
um for children who are removed from
 
03:18:58.429 --> 03:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
their parents for children who
 
03:19:01.590 --> 03:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
ultimately age out of the system um the
 
03:19:04.070 --> 03:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
best outcome of course for children when
 
03:19:06.429 --> 03:19:06.439 align:start position:0%
there is a suggestion that they might be
 
03:19:08.670 --> 03:19:08.680 align:start position:0%
subjected to some abuse or neglect would
 
03:19:10.910 --> 03:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
be for the family to get the services
 
03:19:13.309 --> 03:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
they need to stay intact to not have the
 
03:19:15.590 --> 03:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
children removed having those benefits
 
03:19:17.510 --> 03:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
available helping Ames to apply for
 
03:19:19.950 --> 03:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
these benefits can help maintain family
 
03:19:22.870 --> 03:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
stability help them maintain food and
 
03:19:25.030 --> 03:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
nutrition and housing for the child if
 
03:19:26.910 --> 03:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
children need to be removed due to
 
03:19:29.189 --> 03:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
safety concerns having those benefits
 
03:19:31.510 --> 03:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
available can help with reunification or
 
03:19:34.110 --> 03:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
also help entice a kinship family to
 
03:19:36.229 --> 03:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
actually house a child knowing that they
 
03:19:37.550 --> 03:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
can get the rest that they might need
 
03:19:39.269 --> 03:19:39.279 align:start position:0%
for a child with disability or other
 
03:19:40.790 --> 03:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
services or supports that they would
 
03:19:43.389 --> 03:19:43.399 align:start position:0%
need to maintain the child safely 30
 
03:19:46.269 --> 03:19:46.279 align:start position:0%
seconds oh my goodness I know so I have
 
03:19:48.710 --> 03:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
provided two documents for you one is
 
03:19:50.790 --> 03:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
from Casey Family Services which is a
 
03:19:53.710 --> 03:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
chart that outlines um children who exit
 
03:19:56.510 --> 03:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
foster care um what our homeless rate is
 
03:19:58.349 --> 03:19:58.359 align:start position:0%
compared to the um rest of the country
 
03:20:01.870 --> 03:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
and you'll see um that right now 45% of
 
03:20:04.670 --> 03:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire children 19 years old exit
 
03:20:06.590 --> 03:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
the system homeless this would prevent
 
03:20:08.910 --> 03:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
that from happening I've also circulated
 
03:20:10.950 --> 03:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
testimony from a youth who was in foster
 
03:20:13.309 --> 03:20:13.319 align:start position:0%
care Kamaya Lockett who couldn't be here
 
03:20:17.070 --> 03:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
today she um did experience homelessness
 
03:20:19.990 --> 03:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
um and is eligible for SSI benefits um
 
03:20:21.389 --> 03:20:21.399 align:start position:0%
and would not have experienced
 
03:20:23.469 --> 03:20:23.479 align:start position:0%
homelessness with these benefits I
 
03:20:25.750 --> 03:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
noticed the not so subtle hinge chairman
 
03:20:27.469 --> 03:20:27.479 align:start position:0%
Pearson I'm happy to answer any
 
03:20:30.910 --> 03:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
questions encourage you to support this
 
03:20:34.189 --> 03:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
bill she's very happy because your igles
 
03:20:37.309 --> 03:20:37.319 align:start position:0%
just won the Super Bowl she is too yes
 
03:20:38.830 --> 03:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
don't speak Philadelphia not in my
 
03:20:41.150 --> 03:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
committee okay go ahead representative
 
03:20:44.189 --> 03:20:44.199 align:start position:0%
Raymond thank you Mr chairman and um
 
03:20:46.269 --> 03:20:46.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for that I don't actually know
 
03:20:49.309 --> 03:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
about the Eagles but I'm happy for
 
03:20:51.550 --> 03:20:51.560 align:start position:0%
anyone who's
 
03:20:55.389 --> 03:20:55.399 align:start position:0%
happy um so do can I just ask about the
 
03:20:59.870 --> 03:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
chart you gave us um which is the from
 
03:21:02.590 --> 03:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
2021 is that when the data is from 2021
 
03:21:04.950 --> 03:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
the most recent data I um accessed it
 
03:21:07.710 --> 03:21:07.720 align:start position:0%
today actually it was dated um for it
 
03:21:10.670 --> 03:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
actually has a date of June 2024 so when
 
03:21:13.189 --> 03:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
they published it okay um so does that
 
03:21:16.150 --> 03:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
mean that almost half of the kids who
 
03:21:18.309 --> 03:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
are leaving foster care don't have a
 
03:21:21.150 --> 03:21:21.160 align:start position:0%
place to go when they walk out at 18 or
 
03:21:22.790 --> 03:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
not necessarily it means that they
 
03:21:24.870 --> 03:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
during some time between the ages in
 
03:21:27.309 --> 03:21:27.319 align:start position:0%
this chart between the ages of 17 and 19
 
03:21:29.710 --> 03:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
they experienced homelessness so maybe
 
03:21:31.110 --> 03:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
they had a place to go right when they
 
03:21:33.429 --> 03:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
exited but then they didn't have a place
 
03:21:35.910 --> 03:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
during the interim couple of years that
 
03:21:38.150 --> 03:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
this reports on and it doesn't mean just
 
03:21:40.830 --> 03:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
to be clear that they necessarily were
 
03:21:43.030 --> 03:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
eligible for SSI it just shows this is
 
03:21:45.030 --> 03:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
just one outcome point for our children
 
03:21:46.870 --> 03:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
in foster care and something this bill
 
03:21:50.030 --> 03:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
could do to prevent this kind of outcome
 
03:21:52.550 --> 03:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
it's horrifying thank
 
03:21:55.790 --> 03:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
you any further questions seeing none
 
03:21:58.030 --> 03:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
thank you so much the igles are the
 
03:21:59.510 --> 03:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia Eagles and they won the
 
03:22:02.110 --> 03:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
Super Bowl yesterday yeah I'm not really
 
03:22:04.510 --> 03:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
a sports ball person good for everybody
 
03:22:06.910 --> 03:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
else though you two can talk
 
03:22:15.349 --> 03:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:18.469 --> 03:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
Phillips and and we got 3
 
03:22:20.950 --> 03:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
minutes okay now I have three children
 
03:22:24.469 --> 03:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
to talk about so I'll try okay I am here
 
03:22:26.950 --> 03:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
to talk about HB 661 my name is Stacy
 
03:22:28.349 --> 03:22:28.359 align:start position:0%
Phillips I live in Manchester New
 
03:22:30.030 --> 03:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire my husband and I were foster
 
03:22:33.550 --> 03:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
parents from 2004 to around 2011 during
 
03:22:36.389 --> 03:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
this time we fostered around 73 children
 
03:22:38.110 --> 03:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
we were trained as regular specialized
 
03:22:40.309 --> 03:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
in an emergency home and we did respit
 
03:22:43.429 --> 03:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
we adopted two children from Foster Care
 
03:22:45.150 --> 03:22:45.160 align:start position:0%
um I also feel it's important to share a
 
03:22:46.630 --> 03:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
little bit of my background cuz I feel
 
03:22:49.229 --> 03:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
it gives me a unique look at this
 
03:22:52.030 --> 03:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
specific situation and legislation I
 
03:22:53.710 --> 03:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
have my associates in early childhood
 
03:22:55.870 --> 03:22:55.880 align:start position:0%

the state as a disability examiner
 
03:23:10.189 --> 03:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
working for Social Security disability
 
03:23:13.630 --> 03:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
so very wide gam it my youngest adopted
 
03:23:15.590 --> 03:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
child was placed with me at 8 months old
 
03:23:17.469 --> 03:23:17.479 align:start position:0%
she was failur to Thrive could not roll
 
03:23:20.429 --> 03:23:20.439 align:start position:0%
over sit up hold her own bottle or feed
 
03:23:23.150 --> 03:23:23.160 align:start position:0%

03:23:26.030 --> 03:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
De developmental mild Stones while under
 
03:23:28.189 --> 03:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
my care she slowly made gains but was
 
03:23:30.750 --> 03:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
non-verbal still at two knowing what I
 
03:23:32.630 --> 03:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
know now she clearly met criteria for
 
03:23:34.910 --> 03:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
Social Security disability the regular
 
03:23:36.590 --> 03:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
foster care statement was all we
 
03:23:37.990 --> 03:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
received for this child for most of her
 
03:23:40.070 --> 03:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
time and Care the Staten did not
 
03:23:42.150 --> 03:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
remotely cover the extensive things this
 
03:23:42.160 --> 03:23:44.630 align:start position:0%
remotely cover the extensive things this
child

03:23:44.630 --> 03:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:47.349 --> 03:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
needed the $300 our sensory swing that
 
03:23:49.710 --> 03:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
hung in our hallway the stretchy sacks
 
03:23:51.750 --> 03:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
the weighted blankets are just a few of
 
03:23:52.950 --> 03:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
the things that we had to pay out of
 
03:23:54.910 --> 03:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
pocket I also had to drop down to
 
03:23:57.550 --> 03:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
part-time work because of OT PT speech
 
03:24:00.630 --> 03:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
IEP meetings blah blah blah blah um her
 
03:24:02.030 --> 03:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
aggression issues would rise to the
 
03:24:03.550 --> 03:24:03.560 align:start position:0%
level that windows and Furniture would
 
03:24:07.189 --> 03:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
be broken pretty much on a monthly basis
 
03:24:09.070 --> 03:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
we knew the day we adopted her that we
 
03:24:11.030 --> 03:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
she would likely never live without our
 
03:24:13.269 --> 03:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
support and we would need to plan for
 
03:24:14.990 --> 03:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
when we leave this earth having
 
03:24:16.910 --> 03:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
disability funds would have helped
 
03:24:18.550 --> 03:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
greatly offset the out of pocket
 
03:24:21.229 --> 03:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
expenses to meet just her basic needs
 
03:24:24.429 --> 03:24:24.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:26.910 --> 03:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
future as foster parents we had no right
 
03:24:28.710 --> 03:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
to apply for Social Security
 
03:24:31.309 --> 03:24:31.319 align:start position:0%
disability when she attained age 18 I
 
03:24:33.110 --> 03:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
did apply for adult child with the
 
03:24:35.269 --> 03:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
disability survivors benefits under m l
 
03:24:37.990 --> 03:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
husband's Social Security record she was
 
03:24:40.670 --> 03:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
found meeting criteria for autism um and
 
03:24:42.710 --> 03:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
was allowed disability benefits which
 
03:24:44.070 --> 03:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
supports my theory that she would have
 
03:24:46.790 --> 03:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
been allowed as a child um my other
 
03:24:48.710 --> 03:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
adopted child came to us she was in care
 
03:24:50.229 --> 03:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
for two plus years before she was
 
03:24:52.309 --> 03:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
adopted we found out the state was
 
03:24:53.710 --> 03:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
receiving her benefits from Social
 
03:24:55.229 --> 03:24:55.239 align:start position:0%
Security during this time as her
 
03:24:57.670 --> 03:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
biological father was disabled she was
 
03:24:59.950 --> 03:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
pleased with us she was very parentified
 
03:25:02.150 --> 03:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
having raised herself she also struggled
 
03:25:03.710 --> 03:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
with trust self-confidence and safety
 
03:25:06.070 --> 03:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
awareness we tried to reclaim some of
 
03:25:07.990 --> 03:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
her childhood with camping summer camp
 
03:25:10.030 --> 03:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
and dance classes all of these things
 
03:25:11.590 --> 03:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
came out of our
 
03:25:14.070 --> 03:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
pocket with some exceptions with grants
 
03:25:16.309 --> 03:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
for part or all of Camp dance class
 
03:25:18.429 --> 03:25:18.439 align:start position:0%
class was especially helpful in helping
 
03:25:20.710 --> 03:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
her reclaim her self-confidence and
 
03:25:22.990 --> 03:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
self-worth um all these things dance
 
03:25:25.189 --> 03:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
class be school trip Fields fees
 
03:25:27.349 --> 03:25:27.359 align:start position:0%

Services and other services he happened
 
03:25:55.309 --> 03:25:55.319 align:start position:0%
to mention to me that social security
 
03:25:56.590 --> 03:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
was taking him to court for an
 
03:25:58.910 --> 03:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
overpayment of Social Security benefits
 
03:26:00.830 --> 03:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
despite him never having received Social
 
03:26:02.950 --> 03:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
Security with his permission I
 
03:26:05.070 --> 03:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
investigated come to find out the state
 
03:26:06.830 --> 03:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
had been getting social security for him
 
03:26:09.389 --> 03:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
for years money which he never saw I'm
 
03:26:11.750 --> 03:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
going to now ask if anyone has questions
 
03:26:13.150 --> 03:26:13.160 align:start position:0%
for this
 
03:26:15.750 --> 03:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative Raymond thank
 
03:26:17.269 --> 03:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I have a question what
 
03:26:19.110 --> 03:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
happened with his Social Security
 
03:26:22.670 --> 03:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
lawsuit so he um the state I called um
 
03:26:24.590 --> 03:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
Social Security and I called the fiscal
 
03:26:28.910 --> 03:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
agents at DHHS um and they turned around
 
03:26:32.030 --> 03:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
and went after the state for the to re
 
03:26:33.389 --> 03:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
to reclaim the funds instead of the
 
03:26:35.990 --> 03:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
money that he was owed um so in the end
 
03:26:37.670 --> 03:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
he did not have to pay for it I
 
03:26:39.950 --> 03:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
guarantee there are many others that did
 
03:26:42.710 --> 03:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
though any other
 
03:26:44.710 --> 03:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
questions seeing
 
03:26:47.510 --> 03:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
none the test you were allowed to give
 
03:26:49.670 --> 03:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
was compelling thank you for coming
 
03:26:51.950 --> 03:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Megan Dylan from the
 
03:27:08.550 --> 03:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:11.189 --> 03:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
assistance can you hear me sorry I
 
03:27:12.990 --> 03:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
always forget how the button Works um

Assistant I'm also the public benefits
 
03:27:19.710 --> 03:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
project co-director for New Hampshire
 
03:27:21.910 --> 03:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
legal assistance I've spent the bulk of
 
03:27:23.990 --> 03:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
my career with nhla representing
 
03:27:26.269 --> 03:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
individuals and children in federal
 
03:27:28.189 --> 03:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
disability claims um with the Social
 
03:27:31.389 --> 03:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
Security Agency um and to answer some
 
03:27:33.110 --> 03:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
specific questions about the rep paye I
 
03:27:34.870 --> 03:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to address the specific piece
 
03:27:36.349 --> 03:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
that we added to the bill about the
 
03:27:38.950 --> 03:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
suitable rep paye because primarily this
 
03:27:40.469 --> 03:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
is already embedded in the federal
 
03:27:42.349 --> 03:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
regulations and I've handed out the
 
03:27:44.309 --> 03:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
Social Security Palms the program
 
03:27:47.429 --> 03:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
operations manual guidance that outlines
 
03:27:49.950 --> 03:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
how the agency is supposed to vet and
 
03:27:51.990 --> 03:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
assign an appropriate representative
 
03:27:54.469 --> 03:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
paye for children and foster care and
 
03:27:56.229 --> 03:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
primarily the Federal Regulations
 
03:27:59.070 --> 03:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
already outline that the state or the
 
03:28:01.269 --> 03:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
agency with custodial care is not the
 
03:28:03.590 --> 03:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
automatic representative paye and should
 
03:28:06.229 --> 03:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
not be it actually says should not and
 
03:28:07.910 --> 03:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
not automatic throughout the federal
 
03:28:09.870 --> 03:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
guidance there should be a thoughtful
 
03:28:11.389 --> 03:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
process as to who should be the
 
03:28:12.990 --> 03:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate representative pay for
 
03:28:15.229 --> 03:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
children and there's a preferred list of
 
03:28:18.030 --> 03:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
Representative pay primarily the legal
 
03:28:20.670 --> 03:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
guardian parent if not stepparent and
 
03:28:22.830 --> 03:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
beyond that it could be someone who has
 
03:28:24.790 --> 03:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
a vested interest in this child who
 
03:28:26.550 --> 03:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't have custodial care that could
 
03:28:29.309 --> 03:28:29.319 align:start position:0%
be an older sibling a grandparent there
 
03:28:31.110 --> 03:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
are many people in these children's
 
03:28:33.189 --> 03:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
lives just because they're in care
 
03:28:34.910 --> 03:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they don't have someone
 
03:28:37.110 --> 03:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
with a vested interest in this child who
 
03:28:38.910 --> 03:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
could have been conserving the funds the
 
03:28:41.309 --> 03:28:41.319 align:start position:0%
entire time we have an example of one of
 
03:28:44.550 --> 03:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
those children in the room today um that
 
03:28:47.269 --> 03:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
exactly happens so in these instances
 
03:28:49.150 --> 03:28:49.160 align:start position:0%
frequently the state was automatically
 
03:28:50.630 --> 03:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
assigned or applying to be the
 
03:28:52.389 --> 03:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
representative PE and there was very
 
03:28:54.229 --> 03:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
little happening related to them
 
03:28:56.590 --> 03:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
searching out a potential other family
 
03:28:59.189 --> 03:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
member or person with a vested interest
 
03:29:01.469 --> 03:29:01.479 align:start position:0%
in this child many of these children
 
03:29:03.110 --> 03:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
could have had funds conserved the
 
03:29:05.189 --> 03:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
entire time if that person with the
 
03:29:07.349 --> 03:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
vested interest had been doing it and to
 
03:29:09.189 --> 03:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
answer your questions about spending
 
03:29:11.910 --> 03:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
related to conserved funds or funds for
 
03:29:14.309 --> 03:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
the beneficiary it is built into the
 
03:29:16.710 --> 03:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
federal regulations that the mission of
 
03:29:19.870 --> 03:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
SSI survivors SSDI for children is for
 
03:29:22.710 --> 03:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the child the child's
 
03:29:25.229 --> 03:29:25.239 align:start position:0%
interests the child's needs those funds
 
03:29:27.189 --> 03:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
are to be used towards the interest of a
 
03:29:29.750 --> 03:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
child many of these children identified
 
03:29:32.229 --> 03:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
for these very strict benefits and
 
03:29:34.710 --> 03:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
disability criteria are also identified
 
03:29:36.870 --> 03:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
for special education and as we know
 
03:29:38.389 --> 03:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
these children are required to have a
 
03:29:41.150 --> 03:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
transition plan the transition pen plan
 
03:29:43.630 --> 03:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
is usually and hopefully reunification
 
03:29:45.349 --> 03:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
which means they can work with the
 
03:29:47.990 --> 03:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
agency the Federal agency to ensure that
 
03:29:49.910 --> 03:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
needs of the child means conserving
 
03:29:51.910 --> 03:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
those funds for the family to allow that
 
03:29:54.670 --> 03:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
child to come back to a home that is
 
03:29:57.469 --> 03:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
complete and current on rent and current
 
03:29:59.910 --> 03:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
on mortgage because the plan was for the
 
03:30:01.670 --> 03:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
needs of the child going forward to be
 
03:30:03.630 --> 03:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
unified with their family that is
 
03:30:05.110 --> 03:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
something I've seen in my work that's
 
03:30:07.110 --> 03:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
something that I've seen with children
 
03:30:09.389 --> 03:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
that I have set up that we have assisted
 
03:30:10.830 --> 03:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
who have account set up where are
 
03:30:12.710 --> 03:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
conserving funds and searching for that
 
03:30:14.790 --> 03:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate rep pay for those children
 
03:30:17.469 --> 03:30:17.479 align:start position:0%

DCF and in in response to being as brief

as possible we did uh pass out the
 
03:31:31.269 --> 03:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
actual report that was mentioned uh by
 
03:31:33.550 --> 03:31:33.560 align:start position:0%
representative walner and again by way
 
03:31:35.870 --> 03:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
of procedure and by way of of uh
 
03:31:39.269 --> 03:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
confirming what this is uh last term in
 
03:31:42.389 --> 03:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
uh the finance committee House Bill 1598
 
03:31:47.229 --> 03:31:47.239 align:start position:0%
was amended to result in DH HS be given
 
03:31:50.950 --> 03:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
be given a an appropriation to hire a
 
03:31:54.550 --> 03:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
public uh consultant to study our
 
03:31:57.670 --> 03:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
process of conserving and managing funds
 
03:32:00.590 --> 03:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
to look at our process to dive into what
 
03:32:03.429 --> 03:32:03.439 align:start position:0%
it means to have a c a child- centered
 
03:32:06.150 --> 03:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
benefits and management of federal funds
 
03:32:08.590 --> 03:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
because it's a very very complicated
 
03:32:10.710 --> 03:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
process anything with the federal
 
03:32:13.630 --> 03:32:13.640 align:start position:0%
government um especially Social Security
 
03:32:16.790 --> 03:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
is very complicated and has a lot of
 
03:32:19.630 --> 03:32:19.640 align:start position:0%
nuances especially at this point in time
 
03:32:22.590 --> 03:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
that it is at the precipice of what many
 
03:32:24.910 --> 03:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
states are looking at Arizona was the
 
03:32:28.070 --> 03:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
Trailblazer two years ago with their
 
03:32:30.830 --> 03:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
legislation last term U Massachusetts
 
03:32:35.389 --> 03:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
did similar um uh legislative um acts to
 
03:32:37.790 --> 03:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
conserve Federal benefits for kiddos
 
03:32:40.309 --> 03:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
that is also mentioned in the Consulting
 
03:32:44.389 --> 03:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
um report uh I I do ask that everyone
 
03:32:46.030 --> 03:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
read that report I think it's a I think
 
03:32:48.070 --> 03:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
it's a wealth of information especially
 
03:32:52.349 --> 03:32:52.359 align:start position:0%
in explaining a very very complicated
 
03:32:57.269 --> 03:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
process thank you and it actually slides
 
03:33:00.910 --> 03:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
over yeah thank you welcome um thank you
 
03:33:03.429 --> 03:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
I would also like to add that um
 
03:33:06.950 --> 03:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
currently um there is cost associated
 
03:33:10.070 --> 03:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
with uh making changes to the state um
 
03:33:12.309 --> 03:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
having um access to the child's B
 
03:33:14.870 --> 03:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
benefits to um be able to pay for costs
 
03:33:17.670 --> 03:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
for their care um dcyf certainly does
 
03:33:20.189 --> 03:33:20.199 align:start position:0%
not disagree with wanting kids and
 
03:33:22.389 --> 03:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
families to have all the benefits um all
 
03:33:24.630 --> 03:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
the resources available to them as as
 
03:33:26.710 --> 03:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
certainly as they reunify and certainly
 
03:33:29.070 --> 03:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
as they um prepare for adulthood we
 
03:33:31.189 --> 03:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
certainly agree with that um but I do
 
03:33:33.389 --> 03:33:33.399 align:start position:0%
want to note that it is not included in
 
03:33:36.510 --> 03:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
dcf's agency budget to be able to absorb
 
03:33:39.070 --> 03:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
the costs um that you will read about in
 
03:33:41.830 --> 03:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
in the report so we don't disagree with
 
03:33:44.150 --> 03:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
wanting kids to have what they need um
 
03:33:48.030 --> 03:33:48.040 align:start position:0%
but we would have to um have some um
 
03:33:50.710 --> 03:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
Appropriations attached to be able to um
 
03:33:53.870 --> 03:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
adopt this change any questions
 
03:33:53.880 --> 03:33:56.750 align:start position:0%
adopt this change any questions
representative

03:33:56.750 --> 03:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:59.510 --> 03:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
McMahon thank you Mr chairman is it Miss
 
03:34:02.710 --> 03:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
Nan yes okay want to make sure I had it
 
03:34:04.349 --> 03:34:04.359 align:start position:0%
right uh specific to what you just
 
03:34:07.150 --> 03:34:07.160 align:start position:0%
stated what's the cost of doing nothing
 
03:34:09.030 --> 03:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
so the cost of doing nothing would mean
 
03:34:11.349 --> 03:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
that children um the state would
 
03:34:14.670 --> 03:34:14.680 align:start position:0%
continue to um become relative p in some
 
03:34:18.269 --> 03:34:18.279 align:start position:0%
instances and and use the cost um use
 
03:34:21.030 --> 03:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
the child's benefits to reimburse the
 
03:34:22.910 --> 03:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
state for costs associated with their
 
03:34:25.670 --> 03:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
care which is what the benefit is is
 
03:34:29.590 --> 03:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
allotted for um and so if we were to
 
03:34:31.510 --> 03:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
adopt the changes in here there would be
 
03:34:33.429 --> 03:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
a loss in Revenue to the state as a
 
03:34:35.269 --> 03:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
result and we would need to be able to
 
03:34:37.150 --> 03:34:37.160 align:start position:0%
have the funding to be able to offset
 
03:34:39.870 --> 03:34:39.880 align:start position:0%
that representative D
 
03:34:42.110 --> 03:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
Simone thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:34:44.950 --> 03:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so if you
 
03:34:48.070 --> 03:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
have a child in the Foster Care Program
 
03:34:51.550 --> 03:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
who is not receiving any benefits
 
03:34:55.229 --> 03:34:55.239 align:start position:0%
whatsoever who reimburses the state
 
03:34:58.030 --> 03:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
children are often um eligible for 4E
 
03:35:00.070 --> 03:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
and they still May if they are entitled
 
03:35:03.630 --> 03:35:03.640 align:start position:0%
to Social Security benefits so 4E may be
 
03:35:06.030 --> 03:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
a reimbursable service and otherwise um
 
03:35:08.910 --> 03:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
we have general fund
 
03:35:11.469 --> 03:35:11.479 align:start position:0%
dollars follow up and in some instances
 
03:35:13.229 --> 03:35:13.239 align:start position:0%
I should say also Medicaid depending on
 
03:35:14.269 --> 03:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
the type of
 
03:35:17.950 --> 03:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
placement thank you so if a child does
 
03:35:22.030 --> 03:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
not have any other income whether it be
 
03:35:24.950 --> 03:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
disability or any other
 
03:35:28.830 --> 03:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
income nobody reimburses the state for
 
03:35:31.429 --> 03:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
the Foster Care is that
 
03:35:34.389 --> 03:35:34.399 align:start position:0%
correct so again there if they're fore
 
03:35:36.189 --> 03:35:36.199 align:start position:0%
eligible there could be fore
 
03:35:38.309 --> 03:35:38.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursement um and for some types of
 
03:35:41.309 --> 03:35:41.319 align:start position:0%
care Medicaid is also used to re follow
 
03:35:44.870 --> 03:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
final followup so if that's the case
 
03:35:48.309 --> 03:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
with that child then why should a
 
03:35:52.590 --> 03:35:52.600 align:start position:0%
child's um disability stay with the
 
03:35:55.269 --> 03:35:55.279 align:start position:0%
state and can't be used for that child
 
03:35:58.429 --> 03:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
why does what makes that child different
 
03:36:00.710 --> 03:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
why can't the money be saved for that
 
03:36:04.510 --> 03:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
child to get a leg up when they age out
 
03:36:07.630 --> 03:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
of the fosty care system thank you for
 
03:36:09.950 --> 03:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
that question and we agree again that we
 
03:36:11.790 --> 03:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
would want kids and families to have all
 
03:36:13.670 --> 03:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
the resources financially and otherwise
 
03:36:15.950 --> 03:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
available to them so the soci Security
 
03:36:18.670 --> 03:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
Administration has certain um criteria
 
03:36:22.349 --> 03:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
for what um the benefits can be paid for
 
03:36:25.510 --> 03:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
so relative paye and I realized we heard
 
03:36:27.750 --> 03:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
testimony to the to the contrary but my
 
03:36:29.910 --> 03:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is that relative paye is
 
03:36:32.389 --> 03:36:32.399 align:start position:0%
for the person or the entity providing
 
03:36:34.790 --> 03:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
care for the child to be able to pay for
 
03:36:37.030 --> 03:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
cost of caring for a child there is a
 
03:36:39.790 --> 03:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
waiver process in place so for example
 
03:36:42.750 --> 03:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
if a child were to leave a parent's home
 
03:36:44.510 --> 03:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
um and they were eligible for benefits
 
03:36:47.030 --> 03:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
and the parent now um loses the benefit
 
03:36:48.790 --> 03:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
of that they're able to appeal that
 
03:36:49.990 --> 03:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
decision to the Social Security
 
03:36:52.229 --> 03:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
Administration to not have the agency
 
03:36:54.870 --> 03:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
become the rep paye thank you
 
03:36:56.950 --> 03:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative rice thank you Mr
 
03:36:58.309 --> 03:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:37:00.990 --> 03:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
question so what is the cost to the
 
03:37:04.110 --> 03:37:04.120 align:start position:0%
state when this child gets out of foster
 
03:37:05.990 --> 03:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
care and is left homeless and then the
 
03:37:08.269 --> 03:37:08.279 align:start position:0%
cycle continues and you end up with
 
03:37:10.229 --> 03:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
their children in foster
 
03:37:15.269 --> 03:37:15.279 align:start position:0%
care So currently we do um we do hold
 
03:37:18.750 --> 03:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
the um benefits for a child that is
 
03:37:20.550 --> 03:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
preparing to launch into adulthood for
 
03:37:22.189 --> 03:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
about 6 months so that they can
 
03:37:24.590 --> 03:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
accumulate um certain dollars as they
 
03:37:25.990 --> 03:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
leave so that we can try to support
 
03:37:28.630 --> 03:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
their care in terms of um costs once a
 
03:37:31.030 --> 03:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
child leaves the system I I I'm sorry I
 
03:37:32.750 --> 03:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
don't have the answer that question
 
03:37:35.070 --> 03:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and in the report especially
 
03:37:38.349 --> 03:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
on pages three and four particularly uh
 
03:37:40.469 --> 03:37:40.479 align:start position:0%
the group the public Consulting Group
 
03:37:42.830 --> 03:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
who met with us for various interviews
 
03:37:44.550 --> 03:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
reviewed all of our policies and
 
03:37:47.469 --> 03:37:47.479 align:start position:0%
procedures and Val at our current system
 
03:37:49.189 --> 03:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
um they do point out our program
 
03:37:51.870 --> 03:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
strengths with which already is doing a
 
03:37:54.670 --> 03:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
lot of child censored conservation and
 
03:37:56.750 --> 03:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
management of funds especially for that
 
03:37:59.990 --> 03:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
very vulnerable group that 14 to 17 and
 
03:38:02.070 --> 03:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
also mentions as another strength the
 
03:38:03.990 --> 03:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
receptiveness of the legislature here in
 
03:38:06.590 --> 03:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to that vulnerable group
 
03:38:08.630 --> 03:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh they point to the legislation last
 
03:38:11.349 --> 03:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
term that made it possible that 16 and
 
03:38:14.189 --> 03:38:14.199 align:start position:0%
over kiddos in care can open up their
 
03:38:16.510 --> 03:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
Bank open up their bank account on their
 
03:38:18.590 --> 03:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
own can open up their checking account
 
03:38:21.349 --> 03:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
on their own with certain income
 
03:38:23.910 --> 03:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
maximums because again SSI says you
 
03:38:27.990 --> 03:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
cannot have more than $2,000 in income
 
03:38:30.469 --> 03:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
to make them more financially ready for
 
03:38:33.830 --> 03:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
adulthood to stop that cycle of leading
 
03:38:36.309 --> 03:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
into homelessness and the again for
 
03:38:38.389 --> 03:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
those very vulnerable group and as
 
03:38:40.389 --> 03:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
director Nunan pointed out that we are
 
03:38:42.870 --> 03:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
already earmarking those children who
 
03:38:45.429 --> 03:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
are about to become adults uh get
 
03:38:48.630 --> 03:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
getting them U hooked up with SSA on
 
03:38:50.670 --> 03:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
their own so they can become their own
 
03:38:55.229 --> 03:38:55.239 align:start position:0%
rep PE come 18 years old
 
03:38:57.950 --> 03:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
followup kind of a follow-up Mr chairman
 
03:39:02.790 --> 03:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
kind of followup um jeers like here I go
 
03:39:05.830 --> 03:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
again um so what would your response be
 
03:39:08.550 --> 03:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
to the the wonderful woman that fostered
 
03:39:11.389 --> 03:39:11.399 align:start position:0%
those children and really thank God they
 
03:39:13.229 --> 03:39:13.239 align:start position:0%
had the money to pay out of pocket for
 
03:39:15.990 --> 03:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
the needs of that child
 
03:39:20.389 --> 03:39:20.399 align:start position:0%
how do you justify that money not going
 
03:39:23.229 --> 03:39:23.239 align:start position:0%
to that child for their
 
03:39:26.229 --> 03:39:26.239 align:start position:0%
needs because fortunately they could
 
03:39:29.550 --> 03:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
afford it someone else may not have that
 
03:39:32.710 --> 03:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:35.510 --> 03:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
suffers thank you for that question and
 
03:39:37.910 --> 03:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
certainly I empathize with families uh
 
03:39:40.870 --> 03:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
providing for um Children and Youth with
 
03:39:44.349 --> 03:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
with disabilities with challenges um and
 
03:39:47.950 --> 03:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
I I again very sympathetic to that um
 
03:39:51.429 --> 03:39:51.439 align:start position:0%
the again the the Social Security allows
 
03:39:53.590 --> 03:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
the benefit to be used for costs
 
03:39:55.670 --> 03:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
associated with the care and the needs
 
03:39:58.429 --> 03:39:58.439 align:start position:0%
for the child and so as the state agency
 
03:40:00.750 --> 03:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
when we're providing for for the care
 
03:40:03.750 --> 03:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
and for those for those children um that
 
03:40:05.710 --> 03:40:05.720 align:start position:0%
is why we're currently taking that those
 
03:40:07.309 --> 03:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
dollars and reinvesting it in the
 
03:40:07.319 --> 03:40:09.150 align:start position:0%
dollars and reinvesting it in the
children's

03:40:09.150 --> 03:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
children's
 
03:40:12.309 --> 03:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
care representative
 
03:40:15.150 --> 03:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
Greg thank you Mr chairman I'm trying to
 
03:40:16.790 --> 03:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
think because she pretty much took most
 
03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
of my question um so is there a reason
 
03:40:21.870 --> 03:40:21.880 align:start position:0%
in a case and I want to go back to the
 
03:40:23.550 --> 03:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
foster mom that we heard from because
 
03:40:26.790 --> 03:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
that's our like on the ground firsthand
 
03:40:29.870 --> 03:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
experience um can you explain why she
 
03:40:31.630 --> 03:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
would not have been able to get those
 
03:40:34.030 --> 03:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
funds for um the child that obviously
 
03:40:36.510 --> 03:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
had some needs that um that could have
 
03:40:38.429 --> 03:40:38.439 align:start position:0%
helped with because I'm confused as to
 
03:40:41.229 --> 03:40:41.239 align:start position:0%
why that didn't happen I'm not familiar
 
03:40:42.910 --> 03:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
with her case specifically but if I
 
03:40:44.950 --> 03:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
understood her testimony it may have
 
03:40:48.550 --> 03:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
been the child was deemed eligible later
 
03:40:51.030 --> 03:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
um and so one might think that she could
 
03:40:53.309 --> 03:40:53.319 align:start position:0%
have been eligible as a younger child um
 
03:40:55.150 --> 03:40:55.160 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we appreciate in
 
03:40:56.550 --> 03:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
this report is some of the
 
03:40:58.990 --> 03:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations made to the state of New
 
03:41:01.429 --> 03:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um one of which is that we
 
03:41:03.550 --> 03:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
could increase the screening and we
 
03:41:05.950 --> 03:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
agree with that um that is a step that
 
03:41:08.389 --> 03:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
we can certainly take that doesn't add
 
03:41:10.510 --> 03:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
additional costs it it certainly we we
 
03:41:13.910 --> 03:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
could absorb that um as a dcyf agency
 
03:41:15.750 --> 03:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
and be able to ensure that when kids
 
03:41:18.590 --> 03:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
come into care we have dcyf nurses
 
03:41:21.309 --> 03:41:21.319 align:start position:0%
thanks to the legislature and kids that
 
03:41:22.950 --> 03:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
come into care also get medical
 
03:41:24.710 --> 03:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
screening and behavioral health
 
03:41:26.750 --> 03:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
screening and we could use that to
 
03:41:30.389 --> 03:41:30.399 align:start position:0%
determine potential eligibility
 
03:41:33.510 --> 03:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you so just to follow up
 
03:41:37.429 --> 03:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
with this um putting this
 
03:41:40.550 --> 03:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
into um practice would then help
 
03:41:42.389 --> 03:41:42.399 align:start position:0%
situations could very well help
 
03:41:43.790 --> 03:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
situations like hers where she was
 
03:41:45.590 --> 03:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
trying for the when the child was much
 
03:41:47.510 --> 03:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
younger to be able to get that okay
 
03:41:47.520 --> 03:41:48.510 align:start position:0%
younger to be able to get that okay
thank

03:41:48.510 --> 03:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:41:51.349 --> 03:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
you representative Raymond uh thank you
 
03:41:53.590 --> 03:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so my question is just that
 
03:41:55.950 --> 03:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
um the report didn't make its way all
 
03:41:58.630 --> 03:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
the way around the table so is it in
 
03:42:00.870 --> 03:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
electronic format or some other way that
 
03:42:02.429 --> 03:42:02.439 align:start position:0%
those of us who don't have it could get
 
03:42:02.439 --> 03:42:03.590 align:start position:0%
those of us who don't have it could get
a

03:42:03.590 --> 03:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:42:05.710 --> 03:42:05.720 align:start position:0%
copy because I'd very much like to
 
03:42:10.550 --> 03:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
reference it yes we can get that thank
 
03:42:14.429 --> 03:42:14.439 align:start position:0%
you five more yeah representative George
 
03:42:15.750 --> 03:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
six more
 
03:42:19.750 --> 03:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um I is I I don't
 
03:42:22.750 --> 03:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
know because is someone asking me one
 
03:42:25.710 --> 03:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
day uh they was taking three
 
03:42:28.630 --> 03:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
children um but they didn't want to give
 
03:42:30.630 --> 03:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
them any benefit but they need to
 
03:42:34.070 --> 03:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
support the children by their own and
 
03:42:36.990 --> 03:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
they told me how they can do the that
 
03:42:42.429 --> 03:42:42.439 align:start position:0%
because the the two parents cannot um be
 
03:42:44.870 --> 03:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
with the kids make it a question please
 
03:42:47.790 --> 03:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
yeah question was why they cannot give
 
03:42:49.630 --> 03:42:49.640 align:start position:0%
them the benefit why they cannot even
 
03:42:52.229 --> 03:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
support why they can have a benefit like
 
03:42:56.630 --> 03:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
a to get a or food stamp or something
 
03:42:58.710 --> 03:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
they said they cannot give it to them
 
03:43:02.510 --> 03:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
why if it if already this is because I
 
03:43:06.830 --> 03:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
think so this U 6611 I can support that
 
03:43:09.070 --> 03:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
so once a child come in comes into out
 
03:43:12.550 --> 03:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
of Home Care the family is no longer
 
03:43:14.149 --> 03:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
providing for the care and support of
 
03:43:16.429 --> 03:43:16.439 align:start position:0%
the child and and that is why the state
 
03:43:19.070 --> 03:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
becomes representative P um again I
 
03:43:21.149 --> 03:43:21.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned it's my understanding families
 
03:43:24.750 --> 03:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
could um provide um ask for an exception
 
03:43:27.030 --> 03:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
to that as Canen a relative um if they
 
03:43:29.710 --> 03:43:29.720 align:start position:0%
were receiving pay um at at at the time
 
03:43:32.229 --> 03:43:32.239 align:start position:0%
the child came into care but at at that
 
03:43:34.630 --> 03:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
time the state is then PR preparing or
 
03:43:36.750 --> 03:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
providing the care for the child and so
 
03:43:39.429 --> 03:43:39.439 align:start position:0%
is is then responsible uh to to accept
 
03:43:39.439 --> 03:43:42.710 align:start position:0%
is is then responsible uh to to accept
those

03:43:42.710 --> 03:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:45.110 --> 03:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
dollars saying no further questions
 
03:43:47.870 --> 03:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank
 
03:43:54.229 --> 03:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:06.229 --> 03:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:09.149 --> 03:44:09.159 align:start position:0%
minutes hello Mr chairman and committee
 
03:44:10.469 --> 03:44:10.479 align:start position:0%
um I want to thank you all for allowing
 
03:44:12.550 --> 03:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
me to speak today I I'll try to you know
 
03:44:15.630 --> 03:44:15.640 align:start position:0%
make it quick um my name name is Dawson
 
03:44:17.950 --> 03:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
Hayes I was a part of dcf's foster care
 
03:44:20.510 --> 03:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
system from August of 2021 until I was
 
03:44:23.790 --> 03:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
adopted last year um for three years DCF
 
03:44:25.790 --> 03:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
pocketed my Social Security payments
 
03:44:27.149 --> 03:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
keeping a total of
 
03:44:29.830 --> 03:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
$116,000 that was intended for me this
 
03:44:32.229 --> 03:44:32.239 align:start position:0%
is a common practice for foster kids
 
03:44:35.110 --> 03:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
whose parents are disabled or deceased
 
03:44:37.670 --> 03:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
this is unfair because DCF already
 
03:44:39.790 --> 03:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
receives Government funding for the care
 
03:44:42.030 --> 03:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
they arranged for foster kids like me I
 
03:44:44.149 --> 03:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
wonder why only the foster kids who are
 
03:44:46.149 --> 03:44:46.159 align:start position:0%
entitled to social security or venerates
 
03:44:49.110 --> 03:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
benefits are essentially forced uh to
 
03:44:52.269 --> 03:44:52.279 align:start position:0%
pay for their own foster
 
03:44:54.910 --> 03:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
care I was told by my case worker that
 
03:44:56.990 --> 03:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
the money was kept to pay for the care
 
03:44:59.830 --> 03:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
and Services I received I have to say I
 
03:45:01.710 --> 03:45:01.720 align:start position:0%
certainly did not receive an extra
 
03:45:04.469 --> 03:45:04.479 align:start position:0%
$166,000 worth of care and services
 
03:45:06.030 --> 03:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
foster kids need every Advantage they
 
03:45:08.550 --> 03:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
can get and this obviously includes the
 
03:45:10.269 --> 03:45:10.279 align:start position:0%
Social Security or venerous benefits
 
03:45:12.670 --> 03:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
that are intended for them according to
 
03:45:15.189 --> 03:45:15.199 align:start position:0%
the report that was recently completed a
 
03:45:17.149 --> 03:45:17.159 align:start position:0%
lot of foster kids have these payments
 
03:45:20.070 --> 03:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
taken from them by DCF this practice
 
03:45:22.950 --> 03:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
must stop fewer than half of foster kids
 
03:45:26.030 --> 03:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
even graduate high school and only 3%
 
03:45:28.670 --> 03:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
graduate from a 4-year College in fact
 
03:45:30.950 --> 03:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
22% of foster youth experience
 
03:45:32.790 --> 03:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
homelessness within their first year out
 
03:45:35.550 --> 03:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
of care considering these facts it seems
 
03:45:37.990 --> 03:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
incredible that DCF keeps any of the
 
03:45:39.830 --> 03:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
money that would actually go a long way
 
03:45:42.030 --> 03:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
towards helping the foster kids I think
 
03:45:43.590 --> 03:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
the money should be saved and put into a
 
03:45:45.469 --> 03:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
high yield savings account for the
 
03:45:46.830 --> 03:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
children to have when they get out of
 
03:45:49.189 --> 03:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
foster care for a jump start to help
 
03:45:52.309 --> 03:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
with the cost of Transportation food Etc
 
03:45:54.269 --> 03:45:54.279 align:start position:0%
my own sister aged out of foster care
 
03:45:56.469 --> 03:45:56.479 align:start position:0%
luckily for her My adoptive parents
 
03:45:58.590 --> 03:45:58.600 align:start position:0%
bought her a brand new car so she could
 
03:46:00.110 --> 03:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
get a job and not struggle with
 
03:46:02.429 --> 03:46:02.439 align:start position:0%
Transportation but without this she
 
03:46:04.550 --> 03:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
would have had no way to get a job and
 
03:46:06.830 --> 03:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
keep it and earn money this is the
 
03:46:09.269 --> 03:46:09.279 align:start position:0%
reality for most foster kids who age out
 
03:46:11.670 --> 03:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
they have no resources and no way to
 
03:46:14.070 --> 03:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
keep a roof over their heads that's why
 
03:46:16.110 --> 03:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
so many end up home homeless the thing
 
03:46:17.990 --> 03:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
is this money can mean the difference
 
03:46:19.790 --> 03:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
between being able to support yourself
 
03:46:22.070 --> 03:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
or ending up on welfare and food stamps
 
03:46:24.429 --> 03:46:24.439 align:start position:0%
for survival if you want foster kids to
 
03:46:25.950 --> 03:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
grow up and be independent and
 
03:46:27.910 --> 03:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient they should be given
 
03:46:29.469 --> 03:46:29.479 align:start position:0%
every bit of help to start with their
 
03:46:32.189 --> 03:46:32.199 align:start position:0%
adult lives $16,000 might not seem like
 
03:46:34.429 --> 03:46:34.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of money but to a foster kid I
 
03:46:36.670 --> 03:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
promise you it truly
 
03:46:38.950 --> 03:46:38.960 align:start position:0%

beautifully said wasn't it great yes it
 
03:47:32.670 --> 03:47:32.680 align:start position:0%

um and I am here in support of House
Bill

03:47:38.950 --> 03:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:47:41.630 --> 03:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
661 um I agree with the testimony before
 
03:47:43.950 --> 03:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
me in support of this bill um and I do
 
03:47:45.429 --> 03:47:45.439 align:start position:0%
just want to add a little a little bit
 
03:47:48.389 --> 03:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
of um my experience in working in
 
03:47:50.389 --> 03:47:50.399 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts with children in the
 
03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
system and their social security funds
 
03:47:53.590 --> 03:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
um when I worked for the state of
 
03:47:56.510 --> 03:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts which I left in
 
03:48:00.469 --> 03:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
2021 um we at that time already had been
 
03:48:03.870 --> 03:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
conserving funds for kids and Care um as
 
03:48:05.630 --> 03:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
already explained it could meet it could
 
03:48:07.750 --> 03:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
go up to the max of $2,000 at any given
 
03:48:10.149 --> 03:48:10.159 align:start position:0%
time and then as social workers we were
 
03:48:11.389 --> 03:48:11.399 align:start position:0%
responsible for spending down their
 
03:48:13.630 --> 03:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
funds on something that they needed um I
 
03:48:14.910 --> 03:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
can give you a couple of examples of
 
03:48:17.070 --> 03:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
items that we would get for children um
 
03:48:19.110 --> 03:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
often times particularly for for U
 
03:48:21.870 --> 03:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
Middle School or teenagers um laptops so
 
03:48:24.469 --> 03:48:24.479 align:start position:0%
they could do homework at home um that
 
03:48:26.990 --> 03:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
they could do up job applications um and
 
03:48:28.070 --> 03:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
this is something that would carry them
 
03:48:29.429 --> 03:48:29.439 align:start position:0%
through typically through college as
 
03:48:31.110 --> 03:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
well the laptop was purchased early on
 
03:48:32.710 --> 03:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
and in good quality they can preserve
 
03:48:34.510 --> 03:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
that and then use that in college or in
 
03:48:37.429 --> 03:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
their future career um also children are
 
03:48:39.149 --> 03:48:39.159 align:start position:0%
children they want to have nice things
 
03:48:40.630 --> 03:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
like their peers have and so we would
 
03:48:41.870 --> 03:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
have kids that wanted really nice
 
03:48:43.990 --> 03:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
Sneakers but we could not expect foster
 
03:48:45.630 --> 03:48:45.640 align:start position:0%
parents to fo that bill because they
 
03:48:47.030 --> 03:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
were already paying so much to be able
 
03:48:49.070 --> 03:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
to provide the day-to-day care and so to
 
03:48:51.630 --> 03:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
be able to gift a child a pair of Nike
 
03:48:53.309 --> 03:48:53.319 align:start position:0%
sneakers that they want around their
 
03:48:55.469 --> 03:48:55.479 align:start position:0%
birthday time um because they they have
 
03:48:57.030 --> 03:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
the funds they are available to them it
 
03:48:58.710 --> 03:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
was giving them a sense of normaly and
 
03:49:01.070 --> 03:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
that sense of normaly has a true impact
 
03:49:03.630 --> 03:49:03.640 align:start position:0%
on their long-term outcomes because now
 
03:49:05.110 --> 03:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
they don't feel different than they're
 
03:49:07.670 --> 03:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
not marginalized and they do feel like
 
03:49:10.070 --> 03:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
they can amount to something someday um
 
03:49:12.189 --> 03:49:12.199 align:start position:0%
other things as mentioned already um
 
03:49:13.910 --> 03:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
intensive therapies that are not covered
 
03:49:15.429 --> 03:49:15.439 align:start position:0%
by insurance
 
03:49:17.429 --> 03:49:17.439 align:start position:0%
um devices for children who have
 
03:49:20.030 --> 03:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities U we recently had a call to
 
03:49:22.389 --> 03:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
our office about a kiddo in care who had
 
03:49:24.910 --> 03:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
a communication device that was broken
 
03:49:26.389 --> 03:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
um while they were at their facility the
 
03:49:27.950 --> 03:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
facility did respond appropriately and
 
03:49:29.870 --> 03:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
immediately reached out to insurance but
 
03:49:31.030 --> 03:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
that left that child without a
 
03:49:34.510 --> 03:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
communication device for almost a month
 
03:49:35.950 --> 03:49:35.960 align:start position:0%
um and then they were having visitation
 
03:49:37.630 --> 03:49:37.640 align:start position:0%
with family and during that time they
 
03:49:39.910 --> 03:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
could not communicate with their family
 
03:49:42.070 --> 03:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
um which created more outbursts and
 
03:49:44.910 --> 03:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
difficulties in their visitation and IDE
 
03:49:46.189 --> 03:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
that child should have had that device
 
03:49:47.510 --> 03:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
immediately if those funds were
 
03:49:49.670 --> 03:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
available that could have been purchased
 
03:49:51.229 --> 03:49:51.239 align:start position:0%
by the division and they could have that
 
03:49:53.590 --> 03:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
even as a backup device in the future um
 
03:49:54.990 --> 03:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
so there's so much that can be done with
 
03:49:56.469 --> 03:49:56.479 align:start position:0%
these funds and for that reason we are
 
03:49:58.349 --> 03:49:58.359 align:start position:0%
in support of this Bill thank you any
 
03:50:00.910 --> 03:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
03:50:03.830 --> 03:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
OCA seeing none thanks for coming again
 
03:50:05.550 --> 03:50:05.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chair recognizes
 
03:50:31.389 --> 03:50:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:33.309 --> 03:50:33.319 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman and members of
 
03:50:35.269 --> 03:50:35.279 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Emily Lawrence
 
03:50:37.229 --> 03:50:37.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm the advocacy director with
 
03:50:40.469 --> 03:50:40.479 align:start position:0%
Waypoint Waypoint is a nonprofit
 
03:50:43.830 --> 03:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
organization that works with children um
 
03:50:45.110 --> 03:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
that are involved with with the division
 
03:50:46.870 --> 03:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
for Youth and families in a couple of
 
03:50:49.030 --> 03:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
different ways one is that we provide
 
03:50:51.429 --> 03:50:51.439 align:start position:0%
inhome services supports and services
 
03:50:54.710 --> 03:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
for court that are court ordered when a
 
03:50:57.670 --> 03:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
um when a child comes into the system
 
03:51:00.309 --> 03:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
and then also when a child exits the
 
03:51:02.389 --> 03:51:02.399 align:start position:0%
system we often provide services through
 
03:51:04.189 --> 03:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
our homeless Youth and young adult
 
03:51:06.590 --> 03:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
programs and so what I'm passing out to
 
03:51:08.910 --> 03:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
you today is actually testimony that was
 
03:51:11.630 --> 03:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
written by our program director for the
 
03:51:14.910 --> 03:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
homeless youth young uh youth and young
 
03:51:17.429 --> 03:51:17.439 align:start position:0%
adult programs she was not able to be
 
03:51:19.990 --> 03:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
here today but we wanted to share um
 
03:51:22.189 --> 03:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
some of her experiences with these young
 
03:51:24.870 --> 03:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
adults who age out of care often into
 
03:51:27.670 --> 03:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
homelessness at right when they age out
 
03:51:30.030 --> 03:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
or may experience homelessness several
 
03:51:30.040 --> 03:51:30.870 align:start position:0%
or may experience homelessness several
years

03:51:30.870 --> 03:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:51:33.630 --> 03:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
after um I think there are several
 
03:51:35.710 --> 03:51:35.720 align:start position:0%
examples that we put in the letter so I
 
03:51:37.670 --> 03:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
don't want to belabor that but just to
 
03:51:39.950 --> 03:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
say that there are countless stories
 
03:51:42.429 --> 03:51:42.439 align:start position:0%
that she has seen of young people coming
 
03:51:45.670 --> 03:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
in um who have as I said aged out of
 
03:51:47.550 --> 03:51:47.560 align:start position:0%
care we cannot confirm whether they
 
03:51:50.630 --> 03:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
would have been eligible for SSI or not
 
03:51:52.710 --> 03:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
but even if we took a fraction of those
 
03:51:54.429 --> 03:51:54.439 align:start position:0%
it would still be a significant number
 
03:51:56.269 --> 03:51:56.279 align:start position:0%
of kids who could have benefited from
 
03:51:59.149 --> 03:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
that money to help them with things like
 
03:52:02.030 --> 03:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
even basic urgent Necessities clothes
 
03:52:06.469 --> 03:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
food shelter a phone um and then more
 
03:52:09.149 --> 03:52:09.159 align:start position:0%
longterm as well for Education um
 
03:52:12.149 --> 03:52:12.159 align:start position:0%
helping them to find a job and just to
 
03:52:13.870 --> 03:52:13.880 align:start position:0%
connect with other people in their
 
03:52:16.269 --> 03:52:16.279 align:start position:0%
community transportation is another need
 
03:52:19.469 --> 03:52:19.479 align:start position:0%
that we see frequently so we are in
 
03:52:21.510 --> 03:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
strong support of House Bill
 
03:52:24.070 --> 03:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
661 and we hope that the committee will
 
03:52:27.349 --> 03:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
pass the bill I happy to take any
 
03:52:33.070 --> 03:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:35.790 --> 03:52:35.800 align:start position:0%

03:53:01.560 --> 03:53:03.149 align:start position:0%
interest on that inflation is very
high

03:53:03.149 --> 03:53:03.159 align:start position:0%
high
 
03:53:06.630 --> 03:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
um my name is Robert tangue um I don't
 
03:53:07.990 --> 03:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
know too much about this bill but I was
 
03:53:09.469 --> 03:53:09.479 align:start position:0%
listening to the testimony I'm kind of
 
03:53:12.269 --> 03:53:12.279 align:start position:0%
getting warmed up for uh what's going to
 
03:53:15.510 --> 03:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
be happening in the future um
 
03:53:17.830 --> 03:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
today I'm the author of uh New Hampshire
 
03:53:20.269 --> 03:53:20.279 align:start position:0%
Oliver Twist and if you guys have uh
 
03:53:22.550 --> 03:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
read or heard of Oliver Twist it's a
 
03:53:25.990 --> 03:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
story about an orphan who is abused by
 
03:53:29.149 --> 03:53:29.159 align:start position:0%
everybody who was around him uh with
 
03:53:33.110 --> 03:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
officials um what I the gentleman's uh
 
03:53:34.750 --> 03:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
young gentleman's testimony earlier was
 
03:53:37.469 --> 03:53:37.479 align:start position:0%
very relevant uh to what's going on I
 
03:53:41.710 --> 03:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
mean I'm looking at a US debt clock and
 
03:53:44.110 --> 03:53:44.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know if the committee knows that
 
03:53:45.510 --> 03:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
every every single
 
03:53:49.910 --> 03:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
citizen in this room everybody has
 
03:53:54.030 --> 03:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
75.6 th000 in debt so that young
 
03:53:57.469 --> 03:53:57.479 align:start position:0%
gentleman was born with $76,000 in debt
 
03:53:59.710 --> 03:53:59.720 align:start position:0%
and then when you look at a family of
 
03:54:02.229 --> 03:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
three that owns a house with half the
 
03:54:05.110 --> 03:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
equity and the average house price is
 
03:54:10.630 --> 03:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
$500,000 a person who has a family is
 
03:54:12.950 --> 03:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
actually in the positive I didn't get
 
03:54:15.269 --> 03:54:15.279 align:start position:0%
that luckily I had a
 
03:54:18.189 --> 03:54:18.199 align:start position:0%
and I'm very thankful for that um so
 
03:54:19.790 --> 03:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
what we have with this bill it seems
 
03:54:21.030 --> 03:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
like they're
 
03:54:23.550 --> 03:54:23.560 align:start position:0%
intercepting the state is intercepting
 
03:54:27.590 --> 03:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
funds and taking it away from the people
 
03:54:30.229 --> 03:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
who actually deserve it we're born with
 
03:54:31.910 --> 03:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
equal access
 
03:54:35.990 --> 03:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
to all of the state's resources and the
 
03:54:36.000 --> 03:54:37.469 align:start position:0%
to all of the state's resources and the
country's

03:54:37.469 --> 03:54:37.479 align:start position:0%
country's
 
03:54:37.479 --> 03:54:39.070 align:start position:0%
country's
resources

03:54:39.070 --> 03:54:39.080 align:start position:0%
resources
 
03:54:41.990 --> 03:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
and I think that that's something that's
 
03:54:44.870 --> 03:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
very important for a
 
03:54:47.950 --> 03:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
young disadvantaged youth to be able
 
03:54:51.389 --> 03:54:51.399 align:start position:0%
to have available or a foster parent to
 
03:54:53.229 --> 03:54:53.239 align:start position:0%
have available so that they can go spend
 
03:54:56.189 --> 03:54:56.199 align:start position:0%
it at cannaby Lake and give the child
 
03:54:57.670 --> 03:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
something that and then it goes into our
 
03:54:59.630 --> 03:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
economy so it's really just redirecting
 
03:55:02.030 --> 03:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
the funds to the
 
03:55:04.389 --> 03:55:04.399 align:start position:0%
state which is I believe the state's
 
03:55:08.070 --> 03:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
largest employer is the state and then
 
03:55:09.710 --> 03:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh taking it away from disadvantaged
 
03:55:13.030 --> 03:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
youths uh I will ask for some Le lency
 
03:55:14.990 --> 03:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
on my time and and I don't think that
 
03:55:17.510 --> 03:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
there are any questions that need to be
 
03:55:21.590 --> 03:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh asked I will note that I watched
 
03:55:24.469 --> 03:55:24.479 align:start position:0%
every point5 seconds the national debt
 
03:55:26.149 --> 03:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
go up
 
03:55:30.750 --> 03:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:35.070 --> 03:55:35.080 align:start position:0%
you put 47 seconds in Mr Tang's Bank
 
03:55:37.630 --> 03:55:37.640 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
03:55:40.309 --> 03:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
recognizes Emma
 
03:55:50.590 --> 03:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:52.110 --> 03:55:52.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman Pearson and

the children's Behavioral Health policy
 
03:55:59.269 --> 03:55:59.279 align:start position:0%
coordinator at new Futures new Futures
 
03:56:01.670 --> 03:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
is a nonprofit nonpartisan organization
 
03:56:02.990 --> 03:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
that solves problems through policy
 
03:56:04.630 --> 03:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
change and we are here in strong support
 
03:56:08.030 --> 03:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
for Senate Bill 661 today we are here in
 
03:56:09.550 --> 03:56:09.560 align:start position:0%
strong support of this bill because it
 
03:56:12.429 --> 03:56:12.439 align:start position:0%
en ensures that Foster youth have access
 
03:56:14.870 --> 03:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
to concrete supports
 
03:56:16.830 --> 03:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
either during their time in foster care
 
03:56:19.630 --> 03:56:19.640 align:start position:0%
or after which is a proven way to reduce
 
03:56:21.110 --> 03:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
the impact of adverse childhood
 
03:56:22.630 --> 03:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
experiences and give them the best
 
03:56:25.550 --> 03:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
opportunities to succeed later in life
 
03:56:27.870 --> 03:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
countless Studies have shown the impact
 
03:56:30.429 --> 03:56:30.439 align:start position:0%
that toxic stress can have not just on a
 
03:56:32.189 --> 03:56:32.199 align:start position:0%
a child's mental health but actually in
 
03:56:35.030 --> 03:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
the physical brain structure they have
 
03:56:37.349 --> 03:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
when kids are exposed to traumatic
 
03:56:39.389 --> 03:56:39.399 align:start position:0%
experiences which many many in the
 
03:56:42.590 --> 03:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
foster care system have been um these
 
03:56:44.269 --> 03:56:44.279 align:start position:0%
adverse childhood experiences can have
 
03:56:46.590 --> 03:56:46.600 align:start position:0%
have really long-term devastating Health
 
03:56:48.750 --> 03:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
consequences higher rates of heart
 
03:56:51.950 --> 03:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
disease diabetes um depression
 
03:56:54.710 --> 03:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
suicidality uh anxiety the list goes on
 
03:56:57.309 --> 03:56:57.319 align:start position:0%
and on providing concrete supports is a
 
03:56:59.550 --> 03:56:59.560 align:start position:0%
proven way to mitigate the impact of
 
03:57:04.149 --> 03:57:04.159 align:start position:0%
Aces um Aces have uh can be mitigated by
 
03:57:06.870 --> 03:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
protective factors and then well-being
 
03:57:09.149 --> 03:57:09.159 align:start position:0%
can be improved by promoting promotive
 
03:57:11.670 --> 03:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
factors concrete supports are both so
 
03:57:15.349 --> 03:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
not only does this uh stipended of money
 
03:57:17.710 --> 03:57:17.720 align:start position:0%
that the children are have access to
 
03:57:20.510 --> 03:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
during foster care and afterwards have
 
03:57:22.950 --> 03:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
um a protective ability on the child to
 
03:57:26.030 --> 03:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that their uh Aces scores do
 
03:57:27.630 --> 03:57:27.640 align:start position:0%
not impact their health it actually
 
03:57:29.229 --> 03:57:29.239 align:start position:0%
promotes their well-being Studies have
 
03:57:32.030 --> 03:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
shown that when um kids and families
 
03:57:34.189 --> 03:57:34.199 align:start position:0%
have access to finances they have higher
 
03:57:36.910 --> 03:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
rates of long-term stable employment
 
03:57:39.590 --> 03:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
they have long-term um Better Health
 
03:57:41.510 --> 03:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
outcomes and mental health
 
03:57:44.469 --> 03:57:44.479 align:start position:0%
outcomes um so for all of those reasons
 
03:57:46.429 --> 03:57:46.439 align:start position:0%
and all of the reasons that other folks
 
03:57:48.389 --> 03:57:48.399 align:start position:0%
have so eloquently put uh new Futures
 
03:57:50.110 --> 03:57:50.120 align:start position:0%
urges this committee ought to pass on
 
03:57:52.189 --> 03:57:52.199 align:start position:0%

04:02:36.830 --> 04:02:36.840 align:start position:0%

sureair I can get through all this in 10
 
04:03:34.110 --> 04:03:34.120 align:start position:0%
minutes because this is a huge huge
 
04:03:36.309 --> 04:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility thank you chairman thank
 
04:03:39.550 --> 04:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
you committee uh I'm here to introduce
 
04:03:42.309 --> 04:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
HB 652 which is to abolish the family
 
04:03:45.269 --> 04:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
court and I start off with the rationale
 
04:03:48.990 --> 04:03:49.000 align:start position:0%
of why this is necessary So Family Court
 
04:03:53.950 --> 04:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
was established in two in uh 2005 so
 
04:03:56.510 --> 04:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
it's been in existence for 20 years and
 
04:03:59.950 --> 04:03:59.960 align:start position:0%
yet it is antithetical to two
 
04:04:02.870 --> 04:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional Provisions Article 15 and
 
04:04:08.309 --> 04:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
article 20 uh requiring that uh uh any
 
04:04:11.189 --> 04:04:11.199 align:start position:0%
litigant be given the opportunity of
 
04:04:13.790 --> 04:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
court in equity as well as two statute
 
04:04:18.750 --> 04:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
at requirements RSA 490 D3 and
 
04:04:23.189 --> 04:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
4914 in in in point the fact people get
 
04:04:26.429 --> 04:04:26.439 align:start position:0%
shunted to uh the family court through
 
04:04:29.469 --> 04:04:29.479 align:start position:0%
RSA 4911 and
 
04:04:32.910 --> 04:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
two so the family court has uh generally
 
04:04:36.550 --> 04:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
been uhj not generally been adjudicated
 
04:04:40.269 --> 04:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
by judges uh the presiding officer is is
 
04:04:42.750 --> 04:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
often a marital Master now called a
 
04:04:45.030 --> 04:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
referee as such they are not
 
04:04:49.510 --> 04:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional officers RSA 490 d8
 
04:04:51.670 --> 04:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
defines the qualifications of a marital
 
04:04:53.630 --> 04:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
master that they have professional
 
04:04:56.469 --> 04:04:56.479 align:start position:0%
experience in family law of matters
 
04:04:58.670 --> 04:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge of Family Matters personal
 
04:05:01.189 --> 04:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
maturity personal qualities of patience
 
04:05:01.199 --> 04:05:02.950 align:start position:0%
maturity personal qualities of patience
and

04:05:02.950 --> 04:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:05:09.070 --> 04:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
understanding fine okay so in uh 2007
 
04:05:12.229 --> 04:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
this this this I'm I'm trying to shorten
 
04:05:15.590 --> 04:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
this up here the the the uh the Senate
 
04:05:18.750 --> 04:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh brought a question to the Supreme
 
04:05:21.469 --> 04:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
Court uh and it was defined that marital
 
04:05:25.149 --> 04:05:25.159 align:start position:0%
Masters are not constitutional judicial
 
04:05:27.790 --> 04:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
officers they are further not subject to
 
04:05:29.750 --> 04:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire judicial Judicial Code
 
04:05:32.110 --> 04:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
of Conduct like other constitutional
 
04:05:34.429 --> 04:05:34.439 align:start position:0%
judicial officers they're generally not
 
04:05:36.469 --> 04:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
attorneys therefore not therefore the
 
04:05:38.870 --> 04:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
bar association has no jurisdiction over
 
04:05:42.389 --> 04:05:42.399 align:start position:0%
them ultimately uh in most cases there
 
04:05:45.110 --> 04:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
is no official mechanis me ISM to to
 
04:05:46.550 --> 04:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
address their
 
04:05:49.110 --> 04:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
accountability in hearings Witnesses are
 
04:05:51.710 --> 04:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
often not sworn in hence there's no
 
04:05:54.590 --> 04:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
pursuit of perjury Family Division is
 
04:05:57.830 --> 04:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
known in the public as the Liar's Court
 
04:05:59.630 --> 04:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
the facade of being a judge is
 
04:06:03.030 --> 04:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
maintained by placing the court fac the
 
04:06:06.189 --> 04:06:06.199 align:start position:0%
court in a court facility and requiring
 
04:06:10.269 --> 04:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
by law that the the presiding officers
 
04:06:13.710 --> 04:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
wear official black robes
 
04:06:13.720 --> 04:06:14.590 align:start position:0%
wear official black robes
as

04:06:14.590 --> 04:06:14.600 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:06:18.309 --> 04:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned marital Masters uh orders are
 
04:06:21.389 --> 04:06:21.399 align:start position:0%
only recommendations to make them legal
 
04:06:23.469 --> 04:06:23.479 align:start position:0%
they have to be countersigned by a
 
04:06:25.950 --> 04:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
constitutionally appointed and qualified
 
04:06:30.349 --> 04:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
judge RSA 490 D9 all recommendations of
 
04:06:32.510 --> 04:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
marital Masters shall be signed by a
 
04:06:34.070 --> 04:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
judge the judge signing such
 
04:06:36.429 --> 04:06:36.439 align:start position:0%
recommendations so certifi that he or
 
04:06:38.149 --> 04:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
she has read the recommendations and
 
04:06:40.309 --> 04:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
agrees that a meral master has applied
 
04:06:42.469 --> 04:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
the correct legal standard to the facts
 
04:06:45.990 --> 04:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
determined by the merital master in 2007
 
04:06:48.229 --> 04:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
judge uh administrative judge of the
 
04:06:51.670 --> 04:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
family court judge Kelly proposed an
 
04:06:55.189 --> 04:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
amendment uh in the Senate and to repeal
 
04:06:57.590 --> 04:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
that requirement that they that these
 
04:07:00.070 --> 04:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
orders be counter signed by a judge
 
04:07:02.950 --> 04:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
because quote unquote it is virtually
 
04:07:05.469 --> 04:07:05.479 align:start position:0%
impossible for a judge to spend the time
 
04:07:09.070 --> 04:07:09.080 align:start position:0%
they have uh going through the file to
 
04:07:11.550 --> 04:07:11.560 align:start position:0%
uh to really get an understanding of the
 
04:07:13.149 --> 04:07:13.159 align:start position:0%
case to measure the case against the
 
04:07:16.070 --> 04:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
facts that they have found uh that were
 
04:07:17.950 --> 04:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
found by the master it is virtually
 
04:07:20.550 --> 04:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
impossible I think without sitting in
 
04:07:22.510 --> 04:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
the courtroom and seeing the witnesses
 
04:07:24.030 --> 04:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
and judging their credibility and
 
04:07:26.109 --> 04:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
listening to all the facts of the case
 
04:07:29.590 --> 04:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
for a judge to second guess someone who
 
04:07:31.910 --> 04:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
has just done all that is not really a
 
04:07:33.790 --> 04:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
review that occurs right now under the
 
04:07:35.950 --> 04:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
law it is a signature it is a
 
04:07:39.309 --> 04:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
co-signature to the Master's
 
04:07:42.870 --> 04:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
report the 13 February hearing results
 
04:07:45.870 --> 04:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
the bill was not adopted yet all these
 
04:07:48.870 --> 04:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
inadequacies and deficiencies of the
 
04:07:50.910 --> 04:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
system still
 
04:07:53.990 --> 04:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
remain one would expect the rules of of
 
04:07:55.950 --> 04:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
the circuit Circuit Court Family
 
04:07:57.510 --> 04:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
Division should be consistent with the
 
04:08:00.109 --> 04:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
rules of the other circuit courts in law
 
04:08:03.670 --> 04:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
and Equity however rule 1.2 states that
 
04:08:05.550 --> 04:08:05.560 align:start position:0%
the Family Division May wave the
 
04:08:07.790 --> 04:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
application of any rule except where
 
04:08:11.830 --> 04:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
prohibited by law rule 2.2 indicates New
 
04:08:14.070 --> 04:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Rules of Evidence do not do
 
04:08:14.080 --> 04:08:14.870 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Rules of Evidence do not do
not

04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:08:18.229 --> 04:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
apply in case after case you have heard
 
04:08:21.149 --> 04:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
litigants claim their ability to present
 
04:08:23.510 --> 04:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
evidence or gain Discovery has been
 
04:08:26.429 --> 04:08:26.439 align:start position:0%
seriously and severely hampered because
 
04:08:30.429 --> 04:08:30.439 align:start position:0%
rule point one 1.25 States the court in
 
04:08:32.910 --> 04:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
its discretion May limit or expand the
 
04:08:35.349 --> 04:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
scope of Discovery in any case as
 
04:08:38.149 --> 04:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
Justice requires the ability to present
 
04:08:41.630 --> 04:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
evidence and make Discovery is critical
 
04:08:44.030 --> 04:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
to establishing one's case and is
 
04:08:47.590 --> 04:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
repeatedly being denied by this
 
04:08:50.349 --> 04:08:50.359 align:start position:0%
system litigants are not informed of
 
04:08:50.359 --> 04:08:51.189 align:start position:0%
system litigants are not informed of
these

04:08:51.189 --> 04:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:08:53.229 --> 04:08:53.239 align:start position:0%
deficiencies there is no informed
 
04:08:54.550 --> 04:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
consent that they're waving their
 
04:08:56.710 --> 04:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to a trial in
 
04:08:58.830 --> 04:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
equity and that they're submitting to a
 
04:09:01.750 --> 04:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
quasi judicial review and findings of
 
04:09:03.550 --> 04:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
facts by individuals who are not
 
04:09:05.950 --> 04:09:05.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional officers and therefore
 
04:09:08.590 --> 04:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
have no right to judicial conduct review
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
their only appeal is to the New
 
04:09:12.189 --> 04:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court where findings
 
04:09:15.189 --> 04:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
of facts are not reviewable because the
 
04:09:17.510 --> 04:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
app the the Supreme Court's only looking
 
04:09:19.950 --> 04:09:19.960 align:start position:0%
at the law as applied to the facts that
 
04:09:22.510 --> 04:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
have been found by that marital
 
04:09:27.389 --> 04:09:27.399 align:start position:0%
Master this lack uh this this past year
 
04:09:29.510 --> 04:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
re recent session the legislature
 
04:09:32.990 --> 04:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
repealed the judicial conduct commission
 
04:09:35.189 --> 04:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
which was established in
 
04:09:38.670 --> 04:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
2010 to rectify this problem because
 
04:09:40.950 --> 04:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
there was one clause in that law that
 
04:09:43.389 --> 04:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
was found to be constitutionally
 
04:09:47.469 --> 04:09:47.479 align:start position:0%
deficient so now there is no opportunity
 
04:09:50.349 --> 04:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
to rectify this problem so these
 
04:09:52.950 --> 04:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
deficiencies indite the family court
 
04:09:55.429 --> 04:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
system as it is currently as it
 
04:09:57.910 --> 04:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
currently exists it's
 
04:10:01.870 --> 04:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
basically that worm written being eaten
 
04:10:05.189 --> 04:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
by an apple being eaten by the worm
 
04:10:08.670 --> 04:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:11.550 --> 04:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
worms how do you know the harm will
 
04:10:13.630 --> 04:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
continue well you're sitting in a
 
04:10:15.309 --> 04:10:15.319 align:start position:0%
committee that's dealing with those
 
04:10:19.510 --> 04:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
harms Time After Time day after day and
 
04:10:21.149 --> 04:10:21.159 align:start position:0%
there were established two special
 
04:10:24.269 --> 04:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
committies to also deal with these
 
04:10:27.910 --> 04:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
problems I sponsored hr14 two years ago
 
04:10:29.830 --> 04:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
creating one of those committees the
 
04:10:31.309 --> 04:10:31.319 align:start position:0%
thought was the victims would come
 
04:10:34.309 --> 04:10:34.319 align:start position:0%
before you and and make their case and
 
04:10:35.750 --> 04:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
then you could bring the family court
 
04:10:37.910 --> 04:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
judges in to hear what their rationale
 
04:10:41.189 --> 04:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
was you could do that you are as
 
04:10:44.349 --> 04:10:44.359 align:start position:0%
qualified to be a family court judge as
 
04:10:46.990 --> 04:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
they are I read you their qualifications
 
04:10:49.429 --> 04:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
early on you meet all those
 
04:10:52.309 --> 04:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
qualifications you could have made those
 
04:10:55.750 --> 04:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
judgments instead the work is focused on
 
04:10:59.469 --> 04:10:59.479 align:start position:0%
training Staffing and other issues not
 
04:11:01.510 --> 04:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with the fundamental
 
04:11:05.030 --> 04:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
deficiencies of the system as a
 
04:11:08.349 --> 04:11:08.359 align:start position:0%
whole more Band-Aids on the
 
04:11:10.950 --> 04:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
corpse I believe the actual review of
 
04:11:12.910 --> 04:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
cases is necessary to determine whether
 
04:11:16.309 --> 04:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
the family court judge should be removed
 
04:11:18.070 --> 04:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
an actual review should would
 
04:11:21.670 --> 04:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
demonstrate a pattern of violations or
 
04:11:24.149 --> 04:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
abuses you're not going to catch any
 
04:11:26.830 --> 04:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
hidden envelopes or any other nefarious
 
04:11:30.469 --> 04:11:30.479 align:start position:0%
activities but if you listened to the
 
04:11:34.030 --> 04:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
cases and reviewed case after case in
 
04:11:36.109 --> 04:11:36.119 align:start position:0%
those special committees you would have
 
04:11:39.189 --> 04:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
found patterns patterns that have come
 
04:11:41.990 --> 04:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
before you already alienation of
 
04:11:45.149 --> 04:11:45.159 align:start position:0%
affection claims reunification therapy
 
04:11:45.159 --> 04:11:46.189 align:start position:0%
affection claims reunification therapy
with

04:11:46.189 --> 04:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:11:49.070 --> 04:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
abusers evidence of covert surveillance
 
04:11:52.870 --> 04:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
I gave a one this is new I gave the
 
04:11:55.269 --> 04:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
chairman a document here where there's a
 
04:11:59.469 --> 04:11:59.479 align:start position:0%
little screenshot indicates a someone
 
04:12:02.309 --> 04:12:02.319 align:start position:0%
has tapped into someone's private Zoom
 
04:12:06.510 --> 04:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
meeting that turns out to be linked to a
 
04:12:10.149 --> 04:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
family court judge there are more of
 
04:12:12.630 --> 04:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
those kinds of activities they only come
 
04:12:15.149 --> 04:12:15.159 align:start position:0%
up quickly it's hard to get a screenshot
 
04:12:18.469 --> 04:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
we're lucky to get one
 
04:12:21.510 --> 04:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
here we have a system that fails to prit
 
04:12:24.710 --> 04:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
testimony as I indicated by the rules
 
04:12:27.630 --> 04:12:27.640 align:start position:0%
you have a failure of bcss to follow
 
04:12:29.870 --> 04:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decisions you have had
 
04:12:34.429 --> 04:12:34.439 align:start position:0%
testimony early on where a a a uh victim
 
04:12:36.429 --> 04:12:36.439 align:start position:0%
came before you and explained she went
 
04:12:39.030 --> 04:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
to the new hampsh Supreme Court five
 
04:12:41.030 --> 04:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
times I'm going to give you two more
 
04:12:46.149 --> 04:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:48.429 --> 04:12:48.439 align:start position:0%
well then I cannot go through begin to
 
04:12:51.429 --> 04:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
go through this and fully explain the
 
04:12:54.910 --> 04:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
problem of this I mean Mr chairman the
 
04:12:58.870 --> 04:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
family court system is broken it is
 
04:12:58.880 --> 04:13:01.070 align:start position:0%
family court system is broken it is
fundamentally

04:13:01.070 --> 04:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
fundamentally
 
04:13:03.870 --> 04:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
broken you know that members of this
 
04:13:07.109 --> 04:13:07.119 align:start position:0%
committee know that you hear these cases
 
04:13:09.429 --> 04:13:09.439 align:start position:0%
day we are prepared to speak for
 
04:13:12.830 --> 04:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
ourselves and not have you speak for us
 
04:13:15.870 --> 04:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
I I'm speaking for what I have observed
 
04:13:18.229 --> 04:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
that is your opinion it is my opinion
 
04:13:23.510 --> 04:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
yes indeed it is so I will turn then to
 
04:13:26.830 --> 04:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
the the uh provision I provided which
 
04:13:29.590 --> 04:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
the the greater provision which is the
 
04:13:32.910 --> 04:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
uh explanation of what the recommended
 
04:13:34.670 --> 04:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
changes are
 
04:13:39.149 --> 04:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
fundamentally uh you you see that I have
 
04:13:42.070 --> 04:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
basically sent most of the activities of
 
04:13:44.710 --> 04:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
the family court back to the Superior
 
04:13:47.950 --> 04:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
Court that's where they were before
 
04:13:50.590 --> 04:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
2005 if you look at the first page of
 
04:13:50.600 --> 04:13:51.389 align:start position:0%
2005 if you look at the first page of
this

04:13:51.389 --> 04:13:51.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:13:53.590 --> 04:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
document towards the bottom you see
 
04:13:53.600 --> 04:13:55.189 align:start position:0%
document towards the bottom you see
jurisdiction

04:13:55.189 --> 04:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
04:13:58.950 --> 04:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
d.2 you see articles uh sub articles 1
 
04:14:02.070 --> 04:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
and two those are the articles that I
 
04:14:05.149 --> 04:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
have offered a mediation program to deal
 
04:14:09.510 --> 04:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
with articles 3 through 10 go back to
 
04:14:11.469 --> 04:14:11.479 align:start position:0%
the superior court or in some cases to
 
04:14:13.870 --> 04:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
the Probate Court where they originally
 
04:14:17.149 --> 04:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
where why a why a mediation
 
04:14:19.630 --> 04:14:19.640 align:start position:0%
service and and what kind of mediation
 
04:14:22.109 --> 04:14:22.119 align:start position:0%
service am I proposing well the
 
04:14:24.070 --> 04:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
mediation has been used by multiple
 
04:14:27.030 --> 04:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
courts uh in other states already and
 
04:14:29.830 --> 04:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
that's where I drew this this uh idea
 
04:14:33.590 --> 04:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
from is less costly than the the current
 
04:14:38.429 --> 04:14:38.439 align:start position:0%
system um furthermore um I have placed
 
04:14:42.109 --> 04:14:42.119 align:start position:0%
controls here where the mediation system
 
04:14:45.630 --> 04:14:45.640 align:start position:0%
is to be be conducted in accordance with
 
04:14:50.149 --> 04:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
guidance by the AC Academy of uh Family
 
04:14:52.309 --> 04:14:52.319 align:start position:0%
Mediation uh uh
 
04:14:55.229 --> 04:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
professionals um they have standards on
 
04:14:56.750 --> 04:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
training they have standards on
 
04:15:00.149 --> 04:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
qualification they have standards uh on
 
04:15:04.109 --> 04:15:04.119 align:start position:0%
on quality assurance and uh would
 
04:15:07.189 --> 04:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
therefore assure that mediators in the
 
04:15:09.229 --> 04:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
program are not putting their thumb on
 
04:15:09.239 --> 04:15:11.030 align:start position:0%
program are not putting their thumb on
the

04:15:11.030 --> 04:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:15:15.030 --> 04:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:17.229 --> 04:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
make it shorter than
 
04:15:21.269 --> 04:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
that any questions for the prime sponsor
 
04:15:23.109 --> 04:15:23.119 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
04:15:25.870 --> 04:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
chairman and um thank you are there any
 
04:15:29.710 --> 04:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
states currently that do not have family
 
04:15:33.590 --> 04:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
court I don't have a full uh
 
04:15:35.910 --> 04:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
understanding of what system is in every
 
04:15:38.590 --> 04:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
state that's it's every state is
 
04:15:42.309 --> 04:15:42.319 align:start position:0%
different so they they may have family
 
04:15:43.469 --> 04:15:43.479 align:start position:0%
courts that are
 
04:15:45.990 --> 04:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
that are that are part of their superior
 
04:15:49.070 --> 04:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
court system uh you know as a division
 
04:15:52.550 --> 04:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
or a separate entities some uh go
 
04:15:55.429 --> 04:15:55.439 align:start position:0%
directly to mediation as a matter of law
 
04:15:58.429 --> 04:15:58.439 align:start position:0%
it's it's you know it varies state to
 
04:16:00.790 --> 04:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
state so follow up follow up are there
 
04:16:02.910 --> 04:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
any states that use mediation in the
 
04:16:05.469 --> 04:16:05.479 align:start position:0%
cases of child and abuse and neglect
 
04:16:08.550 --> 04:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
cases I don't believe so and that's why
 
04:16:12.189 --> 04:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
I have if you look at the Articles 3
 
04:16:15.269 --> 04:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
through 10 the neglect cases the abuse
 
04:16:18.670 --> 04:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
cases those types of cases uh I I've
 
04:16:20.950 --> 04:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
said they need to go to Superior Court
 
04:16:24.070 --> 04:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
you need to be in a court of equity for
 
04:16:26.710 --> 04:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
that thank you I appreciate
 
04:16:30.630 --> 04:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
it you had said earlier that I was as
 
04:16:33.550 --> 04:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
qualified as a family court judge and in
 
04:16:36.309 --> 04:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
my fantasy life I am but I don't have a
 
04:16:39.750 --> 04:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
JD they do no they don't they do not
 
04:16:43.389 --> 04:16:43.399 align:start position:0%
need to have a JD it's not a requirement
 
04:16:47.389 --> 04:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
most of them do family court judge
 
04:16:50.910 --> 04:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
that they are not required to have a JD
 
04:16:52.389 --> 04:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
they're not required to be a member of
 
04:16:53.469 --> 04:16:53.479 align:start position:0%
the bar
 
04:16:56.429 --> 04:16:56.439 align:start position:0%
association I read I read you the
 
04:17:00.030 --> 04:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
requirements um get to my notes I can
 
04:17:04.349 --> 04:17:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:09.750 --> 04:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
the qualifications are found in RSA 490
 
04:17:14.030 --> 04:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
d8 490 okay look at 490 d8
 
04:17:17.710 --> 04:17:17.720 align:start position:0%
thank you so there's no one on this
 
04:17:19.630 --> 04:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
committee that I believe that does not
 
04:17:21.870 --> 04:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
have the capability of standing as a
 
04:17:24.189 --> 04:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
family court judge and therefore you
 
04:17:27.750 --> 04:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
have the full ability to review and
 
04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
evaluate the harms that you have heard
 
04:17:31.750 --> 04:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:17:34.990 --> 04:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
ask the judges that made that decision
 
04:17:38.269 --> 04:17:38.279 align:start position:0%
to justify those if they make sense you
 
04:17:39.750 --> 04:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
have the you have the common sense
 
04:17:42.830 --> 04:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
ability to understand that decision does
 
04:17:44.389 --> 04:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense why are you
 
04:17:46.389 --> 04:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
putting this child back in the hands of
 
04:17:46.399 --> 04:17:48.109 align:start position:0%
putting this child back in the hands of
an

04:17:48.109 --> 04:17:48.119 align:start position:0%
an
 
04:17:51.030 --> 04:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
abuser I have another question uh for
 
04:17:53.630 --> 04:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
you uh what would be the benefit of
 
04:17:55.870 --> 04:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
creating a second mediation office since
 
04:17:58.990 --> 04:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
we already have one the reason I created
 
04:18:01.149 --> 04:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
a second mediation office rather than
 
04:18:05.030 --> 04:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
take the current one is uh because the
 
04:18:08.070 --> 04:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
current the qualifications to be a
 
04:18:11.870 --> 04:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
mediator are are are not well understood
 
04:18:14.189 --> 04:18:14.199 align:start position:0%
by me in the current system I gave you
 
04:18:18.149 --> 04:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
this handout it let a particular person
 
04:18:21.790 --> 04:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
who is a mediator and a family court
 
04:18:25.109 --> 04:18:25.119 align:start position:0%
judge and on his advertisement he
 
04:18:28.990 --> 04:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
advertised that he handles cases with
 
04:18:32.550 --> 04:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
high net worth Personnel that is not
 
04:18:35.950 --> 04:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
someone who is a neutral party that is
 
04:18:37.590 --> 04:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
someone who's going to put their thumb
 
04:18:40.030 --> 04:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
on the scale in the favor of selected
 
04:18:42.750 --> 04:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
individuals and I don't want that Med
 
04:18:44.950 --> 04:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
mediation and arbitration group to have
 
04:18:47.109 --> 04:18:47.119 align:start position:0%
anything to do with Family Mediation
 
04:18:49.950 --> 04:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
that's why I separated it now that's not
 
04:18:52.910 --> 04:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
to say that you couldn't adopt the
 
04:18:55.550 --> 04:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
standards that I have put into the
 
04:18:57.630 --> 04:18:57.640 align:start position:0%
legislation from the
 
04:19:03.630 --> 04:19:03.640 align:start position:0%
afpm uh FMP excuse me uh and require all
 
04:19:06.189 --> 04:19:06.199 align:start position:0%
mediators to meet those requirements and
 
04:19:08.149 --> 04:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
that would potentially take that
 
04:19:10.189 --> 04:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
individual and individuals like that out
 
04:19:14.950 --> 04:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:14.960 --> 04:19:17.750 align:start position:0%
 
given

04:19:17.750 --> 04:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:20.750 --> 04:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
the statements that the special
 
04:19:24.950 --> 04:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee heard that some family court
 
04:19:27.710 --> 04:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
judges then rotate over to probate for a
 
04:19:30.109 --> 04:19:30.119 align:start position:0%
while and they're not especially trained
 
04:19:31.830 --> 04:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
in family
 
04:19:35.750 --> 04:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
law even though uh one of the small
 
04:19:37.950 --> 04:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
victories the special committee got was
 
04:19:39.830 --> 04:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
further training for our judges now in
 
04:19:42.990 --> 04:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
Family Court what makes you think think
 
04:19:45.469 --> 04:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
that kicking things up to Superior Court
 
04:19:47.750 --> 04:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
which I see in here numbers of times
 
04:19:50.870 --> 04:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
would find a Judiciary any more
 
04:19:53.269 --> 04:19:53.279 align:start position:0%
qualified or trained in Family Court
 
04:19:56.229 --> 04:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
matters because in Superior Court one
 
04:19:59.269 --> 04:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
has to follow the laws of equity meaning
 
04:20:02.710 --> 04:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
you have to have full due process rights
 
04:20:05.950 --> 04:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
in the Family Court as I went through
 
04:20:09.950 --> 04:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
those are gone there are none available
 
04:20:09.960 --> 04:20:11.229 align:start position:0%
those are gone there are none available
to

04:20:11.229 --> 04:20:11.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:20:13.790 --> 04:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
you I think the Rules of Evidence are
 
04:20:16.550 --> 04:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
discretionary They're Not absent it's
 
04:20:19.389 --> 04:20:19.399 align:start position:0%
not just the Rules of Evidence it's it's
 
04:20:21.870 --> 04:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
far beyond the Rules of Evidence I when
 
04:20:24.389 --> 04:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
the quote unquote family court judge can
 
04:20:26.349 --> 04:20:26.359 align:start position:0%
decide what evidence they're going to
 
04:20:29.590 --> 04:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
listen to and someone wants to present
 
04:20:31.950 --> 04:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
well here's the circumstance of my case
 
04:20:34.590 --> 04:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
yet they're not heard that opportunity
 
04:20:34.600 --> 04:20:35.429 align:start position:0%
yet they're not heard that opportunity
is

04:20:35.429 --> 04:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:20:38.189 --> 04:20:38.199 align:start position:0%
foreclosed and there's no reason that
 
04:20:41.910 --> 04:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
they can be given an opportunity to make
 
04:20:43.670 --> 04:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
their case because the family court
 
04:20:46.429 --> 04:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
judge says Ah it's not important that's
 
04:20:48.950 --> 04:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
not going to happen in a court of
 
04:20:51.830 --> 04:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
equity anyone anyone has full
 
04:20:55.229 --> 04:20:55.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present their
 
04:20:58.429 --> 04:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
case all issues will be
 
04:21:00.670 --> 04:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
heard okay looking to see if there's any
 
04:21:03.070 --> 04:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
other questions representative
 
04:21:06.670 --> 04:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
Greg yes I wonder um and I in
 
04:21:09.790 --> 04:21:09.800 align:start position:0%
understanding in depth how Family Court
 
04:21:13.149 --> 04:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
works and how they have to go about
 
04:21:14.950 --> 04:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
certain things and also the
 
04:21:18.109 --> 04:21:18.119 align:start position:0%
complications that come in how do you
 
04:21:20.710 --> 04:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
suppose that putting it mediation so
 
04:21:22.189 --> 04:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
that people can have all of their
 
04:21:23.750 --> 04:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
information put out there when we have
 
04:21:25.349 --> 04:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
people come in here and they have stacks
 
04:21:29.389 --> 04:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
of stuff first stack is like that how do
 
04:21:30.670 --> 04:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
you suppose that they handled the
 
04:21:32.349 --> 04:21:32.359 align:start position:0%
workload in this state and what do you
 
04:21:35.670 --> 04:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
think the um backlog would be to uh put
 
04:21:37.790 --> 04:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
this all in this situation or give it to
 
04:21:41.189 --> 04:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court well first off I I
 
04:21:43.870 --> 04:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
recommended that the uh that the phase
 
04:21:45.910 --> 04:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
out be through two years and I'm going
 
04:21:48.309 --> 04:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
further recommend to this this committee
 
04:21:51.550 --> 04:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
that if you realize that this is this
 
04:21:54.070 --> 04:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
kind of approach is a necessary approach
 
04:21:56.469 --> 04:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
that you may start just like the family
 
04:21:59.830 --> 04:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
court did in one or two counties trial
 
04:22:03.229 --> 04:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
the system work any bugs out that may
 
04:22:06.630 --> 04:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
exist and then expand it to to the rest
 
04:22:09.630 --> 04:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
of the State uh that is not in here but
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
the two-year issue is in here um
 
04:22:16.870 --> 04:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
it the number of cases of of divorce and
 
04:22:19.710 --> 04:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
child custody what not are are are not
 
04:22:22.389 --> 04:22:22.399 align:start position:0%
going to change I I don't think we're
 
04:22:25.670 --> 04:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
changing our our climate and our culture
 
04:22:28.269 --> 04:22:28.279 align:start position:0%
so the same number of cases appearing in
 
04:22:30.710 --> 04:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
Family Court are going to actually
 
04:22:34.550 --> 04:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
appear either in mediation or a choice
 
04:22:37.550 --> 04:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
to go to Superior Court and that's
 
04:22:39.790 --> 04:22:39.800 align:start position:0%
that's the choice that I give anyone
 
04:22:43.109 --> 04:22:43.119 align:start position:0%
coming before the court saying I'm
 
04:22:46.229 --> 04:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
seeking a divorce you get to choose you
 
04:22:48.349 --> 04:22:48.359 align:start position:0%
get to choose a court in equity or you
 
04:22:52.550 --> 04:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:57.710 --> 04:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
mediation if at present 80% of cases in
 
04:23:00.750 --> 04:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
Family Court are
 
04:23:05.189 --> 04:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
prosay how will these people equally be
 
04:23:08.590 --> 04:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
able to go to Superior Court where if
 
04:23:12.030 --> 04:23:12.040 align:start position:0%
all the rules are in place who knows all
 
04:23:15.309 --> 04:23:15.319 align:start position:0%
of those rules or if one person does is
 
04:23:19.269 --> 04:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
not the other proos at a distinct
 
04:23:22.149 --> 04:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
disadvantage so in when you appear a
 
04:23:25.030 --> 04:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
pray in front of the Superior Court the
 
04:23:28.710 --> 04:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh the judge is to give leeway to the
 
04:23:30.670 --> 04:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
understanding of the rules of evidence
 
04:23:34.429 --> 04:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
and the rules of procedure
 
04:23:37.630 --> 04:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
leeway in making appropriate motions
 
04:23:39.149 --> 04:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to guide them
 
04:23:40.870 --> 04:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
through that and that's what they do now
 
04:23:43.189 --> 04:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
if you if you come to court on a real
 
04:23:45.750 --> 04:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
estate transaction and you're a prosay
 
04:23:48.750 --> 04:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
person you you you are not going to be
 
04:23:52.750 --> 04:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
held to the same requirements that a uh
 
04:23:55.710 --> 04:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
a professional attorney is I'm
 
04:23:59.429 --> 04:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
encouraged that since one seems to be
 
04:24:01.870 --> 04:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
negative towards the leeway the judges
 
04:24:03.670 --> 04:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
and family court have you would give
 
04:24:07.229 --> 04:24:07.239 align:start position:0%
that leeway to Superior Court judges too
 
04:24:10.510 --> 04:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
because in in Superior Court or the
 
04:24:12.870 --> 04:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court this these are
 
04:24:14.670 --> 04:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
these are courts where full
 
04:24:16.670 --> 04:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights are granted full
 
04:24:19.189 --> 04:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
du process must be
 
04:24:22.189 --> 04:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
held it Family Court doesn't that's I
 
04:24:24.389 --> 04:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
started off this and I know it is
 
04:24:27.229 --> 04:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
damning and it's maddening that this is
 
04:24:30.070 --> 04:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
this is the truth but the truth is there
 
04:24:32.830 --> 04:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
is lack total lack of due process in
 
04:24:36.550 --> 04:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
Family Court it is it is a a court where
 
04:24:39.149 --> 04:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
that family court judge operates
 
04:24:42.389 --> 04:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
essentially at whim you are totally
 
04:24:44.950 --> 04:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
subject to that person's discretion on
 
04:24:47.469 --> 04:24:47.479 align:start position:0%
how they want to deal with you and your
 
04:24:47.479 --> 04:24:48.630 align:start position:0%
how they want to deal with you and your
rights

04:24:48.630 --> 04:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
rights
 
04:24:51.870 --> 04:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
are you may be granted some you may not
 
04:24:53.910 --> 04:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
it's you know pays your nickel and takes
 
04:24:56.670 --> 04:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
your chance it's it's not an acceptable
 
04:24:58.469 --> 04:24:58.479 align:start position:0%
way of doing business it's
 
04:25:00.950 --> 04:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional it's unlawful and I
 
04:25:03.389 --> 04:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
hate saying that I absolutely hate
 
04:25:05.950 --> 04:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
saying that and I'm humbled by the fact
 
04:25:07.750 --> 04:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
of all the people that I've met and
 
04:25:09.990 --> 04:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
dealt with and raised these issues
 
04:25:13.109 --> 04:25:13.119 align:start position:0%
before me I I can't possibly represent
 
04:25:15.149 --> 04:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
the pain that they felt going through
 
04:25:17.910 --> 04:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
this process but the family court system
 
04:25:20.189 --> 04:25:20.199 align:start position:0%
you know they I it's my understanding
 
04:25:22.910 --> 04:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
and again I'm operating on hearsay now
 
04:25:25.189 --> 04:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
my understanding was set up because
 
04:25:26.990 --> 04:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
people show up in Superior Court and
 
04:25:28.950 --> 04:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
there's a trial of criminals and the
 
04:25:30.910 --> 04:25:30.920 align:start position:0%
next case is a divorce case so the
 
04:25:32.870 --> 04:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
divorce people are sitting in the uh
 
04:25:35.030 --> 04:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
docket next to the to the criminal
 
04:25:37.750 --> 04:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
docket people and the judges well we we
 
04:25:39.590 --> 04:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
don't we want to separate these people
 
04:25:42.670 --> 04:25:42.680 align:start position:0%
out we want a nice convenient place for
 
04:25:45.229 --> 04:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
these domestic issues to be
 
04:25:49.429 --> 04:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
resolved and in so doing they dumb down
 
04:25:52.429 --> 04:25:52.439 align:start position:0%
all the rules and they dumb down the
 
04:25:55.630 --> 04:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
Constitution and as a consequence you're
 
04:25:59.149 --> 04:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
you're left with people that you know
 
04:26:00.870 --> 04:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that every family court
 
04:26:03.950 --> 04:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
judge is bad but you have many of them
 
04:26:06.750 --> 04:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
that are that have unique crazy
 
04:26:09.229 --> 04:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
crotchets everything goes to the woman
 
04:26:11.149 --> 04:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
everything goes to the man everything
 
04:26:13.950 --> 04:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's alienation
 
04:26:17.590 --> 04:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
everywhere there it's there's all kinds
 
04:26:17.600 --> 04:26:19.189 align:start position:0%
everywhere there it's there's all kinds
of

04:26:19.189 --> 04:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:26:22.070 --> 04:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
crazy things that are happening and
 
04:26:25.309 --> 04:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
worst of all and I didn't get to raise
 
04:26:29.109 --> 04:26:29.119 align:start position:0%
this this is all superintended by uh
 
04:26:33.389 --> 04:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:38.349 --> 04:26:38.359 align:start position:0%
4D has been corrupted to pay for this
 
04:26:40.189 --> 04:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
system and that's not not what it was
 
04:26:43.750 --> 04:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
designed for it was not designed to
 
04:26:48.149 --> 04:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
force it was designed for cases where a
 
04:26:51.990 --> 04:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
parent abandoned a family member so the
 
04:26:54.309 --> 04:26:54.319 align:start position:0%
deadbeat dad for those of you who
 
04:26:57.229 --> 04:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
remember back in the in the uh Clinton
 
04:27:00.910 --> 04:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
era right guy skips town you know lived
 
04:27:03.109 --> 04:27:03.119 align:start position:0%
in Iowa he goes to Kentucky and and is
 
04:27:05.389 --> 04:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
not paying a child support that's what
 
04:27:08.349 --> 04:27:08.359 align:start position:0%
title for D was designed for well the
 
04:27:11.109 --> 04:27:11.119 align:start position:0%
way title for a d now forces the family
 
04:27:14.389 --> 04:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
court to operate or or it not forces
 
04:27:17.269 --> 04:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
incentivizes the family court to operate
 
04:27:22.590 --> 04:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
is is a place where it induces the
 
04:27:26.550 --> 04:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
single family uh single Parenthood
 
04:27:30.189 --> 04:27:30.199 align:start position:0%
situation and then that feeds on case
 
04:27:33.070 --> 04:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
after case after case where the parent
 
04:27:35.950 --> 04:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
who has been forced to not have access
 
04:27:38.429 --> 04:27:38.439 align:start position:0%
to their children keeps knocking at the
 
04:27:42.229 --> 04:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
door and keeps the case open
 
04:27:45.790 --> 04:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
protracted cases that's the problem and
 
04:27:48.389 --> 04:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
that's a pattern that you would discover
 
04:27:51.349 --> 04:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
if you asked these people to give their
 
04:27:53.830 --> 04:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
testimony and you collected it time
 
04:27:56.109 --> 04:27:56.119 align:start position:0%
after time you would see that pattern is
 
04:27:59.109 --> 04:27:59.119 align:start position:0%
there I have the testimony from amaly
 
04:28:02.870 --> 04:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
Olsen a New Hampshire legislator who now
 
04:28:04.870 --> 04:28:04.880 align:start position:0%

04:28:06.510 --> 04:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you for that well I'm

Constitution
 
04:28:46.590 --> 04:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional um
 
04:28:50.349 --> 04:28:50.359 align:start position:0%
Cod how we can change that to become
 
04:28:52.229 --> 04:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
Constitution because to come

50 get looked at and 47 get dismissed as
 
04:30:56.309 --> 04:30:56.319 align:start position:0%

for virtually anything that's relevant
 
04:31:13.910 --> 04:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
to the case that relates to a claim or a
 
04:31:16.309 --> 04:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
defense of a party as long as it's not
 
04:31:18.750 --> 04:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
privileged and are you aware that some
 
04:31:21.269 --> 04:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
of the limitations that involved is when
 
04:31:24.229 --> 04:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
Discovery becomes crosses the line from
 
04:31:26.950 --> 04:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
oppressive and harassment to asking
 
04:31:28.469 --> 04:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
questions that are more focused and
 
04:31:31.229 --> 04:31:31.239 align:start position:0%
relevant and by way of one more question
 
04:31:33.910 --> 04:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
one more okay are you aware also that in
 
04:31:36.309 --> 04:31:36.319 align:start position:0%

allowed to file motions to compel and
 
04:31:41.070 --> 04:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
motions to strike interrogatories if for
 
04:31:42.750 --> 04:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
some reason they bound on something
 
04:31:45.950 --> 04:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
that's inappropriate for the case I I
 
04:31:48.790 --> 04:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sure all that's true I'm also sure
 
04:31:51.830 --> 04:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
that one rule 1.25 says the judge can
 
04:31:56.429 --> 04:31:56.439 align:start position:0%

04:32:41.349 --> 04:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
bill and we're now into our three
 
04:32:43.830 --> 04:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
minutes segment role except for one
 
04:32:49.189 --> 04:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:51.790 --> 04:32:51.800 align:start position:0%

Susan Dy and I'm from St straford
 
04:32:59.790 --> 04:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
District 3 which is New Durham I didn't
 
04:33:02.630 --> 04:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
think I would be here today but when I
 
04:33:06.029 --> 04:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
ran for office I had in one I had four
 
04:33:09.109 --> 04:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
people immediately contact me over the
 
04:33:11.070 --> 04:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
last couple of months about what's
 
04:33:12.949 --> 04:33:12.959 align:start position:0%
happening with their children and I'm
 
04:33:15.590 --> 04:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
scared to death for
 
04:33:19.470 --> 04:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
them their stories are are extremely
 
04:33:22.029 --> 04:33:22.039 align:start position:0%
alarming and very similar children are
 
04:33:26.551 --> 04:33:26.561 align:start position:0%
being placed in or allowed unsupervised
 
04:33:29.750 --> 04:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
visits with abuse of parents these
 
04:33:33.510 --> 04:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
children often return with bruises
 
04:33:37.709 --> 04:33:37.719 align:start position:0%
Burns scrapes and even worse and many of
 
04:33:39.789 --> 04:33:39.799 align:start position:0%
these people are going to testify this
 
04:33:42.551 --> 04:33:42.561 align:start position:0%
today one of the most troubling aspects
 
04:33:47.750 --> 04:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
that I've I hear is a recurring theme of
 
04:33:51.109 --> 04:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
punitive and biased treatment to the
 
04:33:51.119 --> 04:33:53.189 align:start position:0%
punitive and biased treatment to the
reporting

04:33:53.189 --> 04:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
04:33:56.310 --> 04:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
parents these parents are
 
04:33:59.551 --> 04:33:59.561 align:start position:0%
motivated and have a desire to protect
 
04:33:59.561 --> 04:34:00.429 align:start position:0%
motivated and have a desire to protect
their

04:34:00.429 --> 04:34:00.439 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:34:03.910 --> 04:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
children frequently they become targets
 
04:34:07.789 --> 04:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
of skepticism and hostility from biased
 
04:34:12.310 --> 04:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
magistrates and um guardian and lims
 
04:34:14.709 --> 04:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
the negative response not only deters
 
04:34:17.429 --> 04:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
other parents from coming forward but
 
04:34:19.029 --> 04:34:19.039 align:start position:0%
emboldens the
 
04:34:21.789 --> 04:34:21.799 align:start position:0%
abuser those who interpret the systems
 
04:34:24.510 --> 04:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
failure to
 
04:34:26.949 --> 04:34:26.959 align:start position:0%
act makes them think that their behavior
 
04:34:26.959 --> 04:34:27.990 align:start position:0%
act makes them think that their behavior
is

04:34:27.990 --> 04:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:34:31.109 --> 04:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
okay most importantly this situation
 
04:34:33.910 --> 04:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
puts the children let me say that again
 
04:34:37.629 --> 04:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
the Children at Risk forcing them to
 
04:34:40.869 --> 04:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
endure endure a cycle of abuse that has
 
04:34:44.109 --> 04:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
lifelong effects and those lifelong
 
04:34:46.830 --> 04:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
effects keep coming back and keep coming
 
04:34:49.109 --> 04:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
back and keep coming back and you know
 
04:34:52.189 --> 04:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
what that means that means money people
 
04:34:54.709 --> 04:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
are making money off of these children
 
04:34:57.789 --> 04:34:57.799 align:start position:0%
and off of these parents we must reform
 
04:34:59.910 --> 04:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
our form Court family court system to
 
04:35:01.750 --> 04:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
help these parents and their children
 
04:35:04.789 --> 04:35:04.799 align:start position:0%
regain their lives no longer should
 
04:35:07.789 --> 04:35:07.799 align:start position:0%
cases drag on for 2 to 3 years allowing
 
04:35:11.109 --> 04:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
abuse to continue and draining parents
 
04:35:14.629 --> 04:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
saving on attorney fees and court fees
 
04:35:17.189 --> 04:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
if they can afford them at all and many
 
04:35:19.910 --> 04:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
can't they can't defend
 
04:35:22.709 --> 04:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
themselves this bill proposes closing
 
04:35:24.750 --> 04:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
the administrative Court as has been
 
04:35:27.910 --> 04:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
told and transitioning these cases to
 
04:35:31.470 --> 04:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
judges who follow the law and that's
 
04:35:33.709 --> 04:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
important we not going to go over all
 
04:35:35.269 --> 04:35:35.279 align:start position:0%

Bill 652 to abolish the family court in
 
04:37:23.070 --> 04:37:23.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire with deep conviction and a
 
04:37:24.269 --> 04:37:24.279 align:start position:0%
heavy heart my experience with the
 
04:37:25.709 --> 04:37:25.719 align:start position:0%
family court has been traumatic to say
 
04:37:27.551 --> 04:37:27.561 align:start position:0%
the least and has at every turn violated
 
04:37:29.390 --> 04:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
my rights as a parent my right to
 
04:37:30.990 --> 04:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
religious freedom and my fundamental
 
04:37:33.551 --> 04:37:33.561 align:start position:0%
right to protect my child from harm I'm
 
04:37:34.910 --> 04:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
here to tell you that the current family
 
04:37:36.470 --> 04:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
court system has completely failed my
 
04:37:38.949 --> 04:37:38.959 align:start position:0%
child my family in the public in every
 
04:37:41.070 --> 04:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
conceivable way my son will turn four
 
04:37:42.869 --> 04:37:42.879 align:start position:0%
years in June of this year and we have
 
04:37:44.390 --> 04:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
been involved in the family court system
 
04:37:46.789 --> 04:37:46.799 align:start position:0%
since October 2021 when my son was 4
 
04:37:49.470 --> 04:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
months old um where I am the respondent
 
04:37:52.070 --> 04:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
in that that case or in the case since
 
04:37:53.390 --> 04:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
day when I've been fighting for my son's
 
04:37:54.869 --> 04:37:54.879 align:start position:0%
safety and well-being to be put first
 
04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
for my right to raise him in accordance
 
04:37:58.390 --> 04:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
with my beliefs however the court has
 
04:38:00.230 --> 04:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
continuously dismissed my concerns
 
04:38:01.990 --> 04:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
especially regarding the abuse my son
 
04:38:03.990 --> 04:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
has endured at the hands of his father
 
04:38:05.551 --> 04:38:05.561 align:start position:0%
my son's father was arrested out of our
 
04:38:07.230 --> 04:38:07.240 align:start position:0%
apartment for domestic violence against
 
04:38:09.470 --> 04:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
both my son and me when my son was just
 
04:38:11.830 --> 04:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
3 months old he was later ConEd victed
 
04:38:13.990 --> 04:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
by a jury of domestic violence against
 
04:38:15.949 --> 04:38:15.959 align:start position:0%
both my son and me he was later
 
04:38:18.189 --> 04:38:18.199 align:start position:0%
convicted of criminally stalking me this
 
04:38:20.070 --> 04:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
is not just an accusation it is a matter
 
04:38:22.310 --> 04:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
of public record to make matters worse
 
04:38:24.429 --> 04:38:24.439 align:start position:0%
my son's father is an admitted opioid
 
04:38:27.150 --> 04:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
addict who has admittedly been in active
 
04:38:28.750 --> 04:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
addiction during points of my son's
 
04:38:31.629 --> 04:38:31.639 align:start position:0%
short life the family Court's response
 
04:38:33.830 --> 04:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
give my son's father 4 and a half days a
 
04:38:35.269 --> 04:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
week of parenting time and give his
 
04:38:37.750 --> 04:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
protective Parent Me 2 and 1/2 days a
 
04:38:41.029 --> 04:38:41.039 align:start position:0%
week yep you heard that right no there
 
04:38:42.830 --> 04:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
is quite literally nothing that the
 
04:38:44.670 --> 04:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
court has against me I don't have a drug
 
04:38:46.310 --> 04:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
problem never have don't have any
 
04:38:50.470 --> 04:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
criminal history of of any kind um
 
04:38:52.310 --> 04:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
sounds shocking but it's actually common
 
04:38:54.590 --> 04:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
in the in the family court because it's
 
04:38:57.629 --> 04:38:57.639 align:start position:0%
clearly not a real Court they don't care
 
04:39:00.750 --> 04:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
um my um after these incidents of
 
04:39:02.869 --> 04:39:02.879 align:start position:0%
domestic violence my son's father snuck
 
04:39:05.070 --> 04:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
into the to my son's school and also
 
04:39:06.670 --> 04:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
became violent and threatening to the
 
04:39:08.910 --> 04:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
director he then chose to have a 2-hour
 
04:39:10.510 --> 04:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
standoff with police which resulted in
 
04:39:11.910 --> 04:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
him being criminally trp pass from the
 
04:39:14.029 --> 04:39:14.039 align:start position:0%
school altogether months later my son's
 
04:39:15.269 --> 04:39:15.279 align:start position:0%
father threatened a nurse at the
 
04:39:17.029 --> 04:39:17.039 align:start position:0%
pediatrician and was criminally
 
04:39:19.390 --> 04:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
trespassed from there as well which also
 
04:39:21.029 --> 04:39:21.039 align:start position:0%
led to the practice dropping my son as a
 
04:39:23.109 --> 04:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
patient altogether despite the fact that
 
04:39:25.269 --> 04:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
my son and I are adjudicated victims of
 
04:39:27.189 --> 04:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
domestic violence the family court still
 
04:39:29.750 --> 04:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
requires per their court orders that my
 
04:39:31.310 --> 04:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
son's father and I share equal
 
04:39:33.390 --> 04:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
decision-making responsibility including
 
04:39:35.029 --> 04:39:35.039 align:start position:0%
but not limited to scheduling all
 
04:39:36.551 --> 04:39:36.561 align:start position:0%
pediatrition or specialist doctor's
 
04:39:37.830 --> 04:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
visits in according with each of our
 
04:39:39.430 --> 04:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
schedules so that we both have the
 
04:39:41.430 --> 04:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to attend this does not
 
04:39:43.948 --> 04:39:43.958 align:start position:0%
protect me or my son as adjudicated
 
04:39:45.750 --> 04:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
victims of domestic violence and clearly
 
04:39:50.070 --> 04:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
disregards my safety um despite my son's
 
04:39:51.990 --> 04:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
father's convictions in an adjudicated
 
04:39:53.190 --> 04:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
finding by
 
04:39:55.230 --> 04:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
DCF um
 
04:39:55.240 --> 04:39:57.110 align:start position:0%
DCF um

04:39:57.110 --> 04:39:57.120 align:start position:0%

04:40:02.030 --> 04:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
eyes busted lips and near
 
04:40:04.830 --> 04:40:04.840 align:start position:0%

04:40:07.070 --> 04:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
do have to keep it there's a room full
 
04:40:11.628 --> 04:40:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:15.510 --> 04:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
very day the chair recognizes Anthony
 
04:40:23.310 --> 04:40:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:26.030 --> 04:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
up we have a room full of people and
 
04:40:33.110 --> 04:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:35.070 --> 04:40:35.080 align:start position:0%
people good morning members of the
 
04:40:37.030 --> 04:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
committee yes
 
04:40:39.750 --> 04:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
sir for the record I'm very skeptical
 
04:40:41.910 --> 04:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
about being here today as my family case
 
04:40:44.948 --> 04:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
could you be closer to the mic thank you
 
04:40:47.628 --> 04:40:47.638 align:start position:0%
for the record I am very skeptical about
 
04:40:49.510 --> 04:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
being here today as my family case is
 
04:40:51.550 --> 04:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
still ongoing I believe because I've
 
04:40:53.070 --> 04:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
already faced retaliation through the
 
04:40:55.230 --> 04:40:55.240 align:start position:0%
court that my being here today might
 
04:40:57.510 --> 04:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
affect the outcome of this case I'm here
 
04:41:00.230 --> 04:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
today in support of HB
 
04:41:02.750 --> 04:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
652 I've often heard said in discussion
 
04:41:04.110 --> 04:41:04.120 align:start position:0%
in this committee and as other
 
04:41:06.230 --> 04:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
committees about the family court only
 
04:41:07.910 --> 04:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
parents that are on the losing side come
 
04:41:10.190 --> 04:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
forward to testify that's not the case
 
04:41:12.350 --> 04:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
here today my co-parent and I share
 
04:41:15.430 --> 04:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
equal custody I'm not on the losing side
 
04:41:17.470 --> 04:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
in May of 2020 my co-parent went to the
 
04:41:19.510 --> 04:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
family division with intent to take my
 
04:41:21.830 --> 04:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
parental rights away the clerk informed
 
04:41:24.070 --> 04:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
her that she needed a lawyer for such
 
04:41:26.628 --> 04:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
action my co-parent was then referred to
 
04:41:28.750 --> 04:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
an attorney who was not only a partner
 
04:41:30.350 --> 04:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
at the same law firm as a presiding
 
04:41:33.550 --> 04:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
judge and he was a managed partner her
 
04:41:35.628 --> 04:41:35.638 align:start position:0%
boss but also had a deep personal
 
04:41:37.948 --> 04:41:37.958 align:start position:0%
professional ties with the judge the
 
04:41:41.470 --> 04:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
family his family and the clerk court
 
04:41:43.830 --> 04:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
um the court clerk sorry before our
 
04:41:45.830 --> 04:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
initial temporary hearing while my
 
04:41:47.868 --> 04:41:47.878 align:start position:0%
co-parent was withholding visitation i s
 
04:41:51.030 --> 04:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
an expar order uh which was denied
 
04:41:53.110 --> 04:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
during the hearing after my co-parent
 
04:41:56.110 --> 04:41:56.120 align:start position:0%
attorney remarked why are we here the
 
04:41:59.510 --> 04:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
experte was denied the judge responded
 
04:42:03.070 --> 04:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
Yes we had it denied at the temporary
 
04:42:04.510 --> 04:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
hearing following the attorney's
 
04:42:06.150 --> 04:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations the court stripped me of
 
04:42:08.030 --> 04:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
my decision-making rights which were
 
04:42:09.830 --> 04:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
granted by God and protected by both the
 
04:42:11.510 --> 04:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution and the
 
04:42:13.910 --> 04:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
constitution of the USA granting my
 
04:42:16.830 --> 04:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
co-parent so Authority while also
 
04:42:19.070 --> 04:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
severely restricting my visitation
 
04:42:21.948 --> 04:42:21.958 align:start position:0%
communication and contact with my son a
 
04:42:24.990 --> 04:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
g was appointed who was also a longtime
 
04:42:27.550 --> 04:42:27.560 align:start position:0%
friend with the judge what began as a
 
04:42:29.670 --> 04:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
lowc conflict case has now stretched
 
04:42:32.190 --> 04:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
nearly 5 years escalating to a high
 
04:42:34.868 --> 04:42:34.878 align:start position:0%
conflict battle fueled by the court and
 
04:42:37.150 --> 04:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
its actors the conflicts were created
 
04:42:39.708 --> 04:42:39.718 align:start position:0%
within the court upon discovering the
 
04:42:41.470 --> 04:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
relationship between the judge and the
 
04:42:44.110 --> 04:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
attorney I requested the judge's recusal
 
04:42:46.628 --> 04:42:46.638 align:start position:0%
and was met with retaliation after four
 
04:42:48.070 --> 04:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
years of battling this Court's
 
04:42:51.270 --> 04:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
manufactured conflict I finally regained
 
04:42:53.350 --> 04:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
equal rights and responsibility due to
 
04:42:55.550 --> 04:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
exposure and involvement with judicial
 
04:42:56.868 --> 04:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
conduct committee the judge was
 
04:43:00.070 --> 04:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately forced to admit his bias that
 
04:43:02.550 --> 04:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
he had not been fair and impartial and
 
04:43:05.270 --> 04:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
he had to recuse himself violations of
 
04:43:07.150 --> 04:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
the Judicial Code of Conduct as well as
 
04:43:10.190 --> 04:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
his own oath of office during this time
 
04:43:12.430 --> 04:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
my son endured repeated abuse at his
 
04:43:14.190 --> 04:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
mother's house strangulations and
 
04:43:16.350 --> 04:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
attempted drowning and other violent
 
04:43:18.150 --> 04:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
incidents at the hands of his older
 
04:43:20.550 --> 04:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
siblings his mother resorted to physical

punishment including hitting him with
 
04:43:24.110 --> 04:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
wooden utensils and forcing him to
 
04:43:27.230 --> 04:43:27.240 align:start position:0%

by medical professionals and law
 
04:43:38.270 --> 04:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement documented these dangers yet
 
04:43:40.510 --> 04:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
despite presenting clear evidence of my
 
04:43:42.708 --> 04:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
expart was denied the court refused to
 
04:43:44.910 --> 04:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
put any evidence on the
 
04:43:48.628 --> 04:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
record do you have any questions for the
 
04:43:51.628 --> 04:43:51.638 align:start position:0%
witness um I have one um I think I heard
 
04:43:54.110 --> 04:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
you mention a judge was disciplined by
 
04:43:57.190 --> 04:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
the judicial conduct commission that's
 
04:43:59.990 --> 04:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
good to know I mean not that they had to
 
04:44:02.910 --> 04:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
be but it's good to know that it can
 
04:44:05.190 --> 04:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
be committee okay
 
04:44:09.110 --> 04:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you sir chair recognizes
 
04:44:27.948 --> 04:44:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:30.590 --> 04:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
got to push the button Bingo good
 
04:44:33.310 --> 04:44:33.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon chair committee um I'm for
 
04:44:35.830 --> 04:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
this bill to abolish Family Court uh
 
04:44:37.948 --> 04:44:37.958 align:start position:0%
title 42 is a non-positive law title
 
04:44:39.470 --> 04:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
which means that there isn't actually
 
04:44:41.110 --> 04:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
real evidence that goes on in family
 
04:44:43.948 --> 04:44:43.958 align:start position:0%
Court um when you look up New Hampshire
 
04:44:47.310 --> 04:44:47.320 align:start position:0%
executive branch um agencies and you go
 
04:44:50.470 --> 04:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
down to the letter f f it says uh family
 
04:44:52.590 --> 04:44:52.600 align:start position:0%
mediators chapter 328 that's exactly
 
04:44:55.030 --> 04:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
what they are family mediators um
 
04:44:55.788 --> 04:44:55.798 align:start position:0%
they're not supposed to do
 
04:44:57.110 --> 04:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues they're supposed
 
04:44:59.868 --> 04:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
to be independent third parties uh if
 
04:45:01.990 --> 04:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
you look into administrative law uh
 
04:45:03.788 --> 04:45:03.798 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court Family Division is all
 
04:45:05.510 --> 04:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
three branches of government in one
 
04:45:07.150 --> 04:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
where the executive branch runs a show
 
04:45:09.350 --> 04:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
using judicial branch
 
04:45:12.110 --> 04:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
documents US Supreme Court Justice gors
 
04:45:14.310 --> 04:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
said that American uh administrative law
 
04:45:16.590 --> 04:45:16.600 align:start position:0%
judges are not judges and these are not
 
04:45:19.270 --> 04:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
courts um the reason why it needs to be
 
04:45:21.310 --> 04:45:21.320 align:start position:0%
abolished because there was uh talk
 
04:45:24.550 --> 04:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
about Rules of Evidence uh and motions I
 
04:45:27.190 --> 04:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
filed uh three motions for Discovery two
 
04:45:29.948 --> 04:45:29.958 align:start position:0%
for show cause along with 500 other
 
04:45:34.110 --> 04:45:34.120 align:start position:0%
motions uh all denied um so when it said
 
04:45:35.788 --> 04:45:35.798 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence don't apply but it's a
 
04:45:38.150 --> 04:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence uh this is
 
04:45:41.788 --> 04:45:41.798 align:start position:0%
direct um washing machine uh child abuse
 
04:45:43.708 --> 04:45:43.718 align:start position:0%
from the court uh you can't have
 
04:45:44.948 --> 04:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence if Rules
 
04:45:45.990 --> 04:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
of Evidence don't apply it's an
 
04:45:50.030 --> 04:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
oxymoronic statement
 
04:45:53.670 --> 04:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah let's abolish family court so uh
 
04:45:56.868 --> 04:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
we don't hurt any more innocent
 
04:46:00.350 --> 04:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
kids uh I did uh two parenting appeals
 
04:46:04.150 --> 04:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
to Supreme Court a motion uh a r of sear
 
04:46:06.830 --> 04:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court both all three denied uh
 
04:46:08.350 --> 04:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
two district courts and the US court of
 
04:46:10.190 --> 04:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
appeals all denied 12 years protective
 
04:46:12.150 --> 04:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
voter no evidence
 
04:46:14.350 --> 04:46:14.360 align:start position:0%
um this is the definition of child abuse
 
04:46:17.150 --> 04:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
through all branches of government um
 
04:46:19.070 --> 04:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
and it's in the American judis Prudence
 
04:46:20.430 --> 04:46:20.440 align:start position:0%
so if anybody has a question you can
 
04:46:22.270 --> 04:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
read it it's all three branches of
 
04:46:25.030 --> 04:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
government in one so it's not very cool
 
04:46:27.030 --> 04:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
to military veterans we don't we don't
 
04:46:31.868 --> 04:46:31.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:37.708 --> 04:46:37.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:40.350 --> 04:46:40.360 align:start position:0%
fredman who now gets to testify because
 
04:46:41.990 --> 04:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
I got the hearing
 
04:46:45.030 --> 04:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
right Mr chairman committee members I
 
04:46:46.910 --> 04:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
speak uh Aubrey Friedman I live in
 
04:46:49.948 --> 04:46:49.958 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater I speak in support of this
 
04:46:54.788 --> 04:46:54.798 align:start position:0%
bill uh the family court is a rogue
 
04:46:57.270 --> 04:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
division of the government and it's
 
04:46:59.750 --> 04:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
clearly I mean there could be an
 
04:47:03.070 --> 04:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
isolated case here of U abuse or what
 
04:47:05.990 --> 04:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
but there's tons it's a it carries a
 
04:47:11.788 --> 04:47:11.798 align:start position:0%
history of abuse and tyranny and so uh
 
04:47:13.548 --> 04:47:13.558 align:start position:0%
I don't think it can be reformed to be
 
04:47:16.310 --> 04:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
honest and I uh they don't clearly don't
 
04:47:18.430 --> 04:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
follow due process and also this
 
04:47:21.708 --> 04:47:21.718 align:start position:0%
business of not swearing in isn't that a
 
04:47:24.708 --> 04:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
red flag right there not swearing in
 
04:47:27.190 --> 04:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
even when you do testimony for your the
 
04:47:29.750 --> 04:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
online bills or whatever you got to
 
04:47:32.350 --> 04:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
you're like test you know it's a you're
 
04:47:34.270 --> 04:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
kind of like perjury thing not swearing
 
04:47:37.628 --> 04:47:37.638 align:start position:0%
in in a court so that's a red flag right
 
04:47:39.868 --> 04:47:39.878 align:start position:0%
it can't be reformed I like the idea of
 
04:47:43.230 --> 04:47:43.240 align:start position:0%
the mediation court or mediation office
 
04:47:45.470 --> 04:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
Family Mediation office try to work
 
04:47:48.190 --> 04:47:48.200 align:start position:0%
things out voluntarily and maybe that
 
04:47:51.628 --> 04:47:51.638 align:start position:0%
can uh bring some of the volume down I
 
04:47:52.910 --> 04:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
mean naturally it's going to be
 
04:47:56.230 --> 04:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
adversarial with family divorce and you
 
04:48:00.750 --> 04:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
know problems like that but um doing it
 
04:48:03.150 --> 04:48:03.160 align:start position:0%
voluntarily can maybe bring the volume
 
04:48:04.910 --> 04:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
down and then if they can't work it out
 
04:48:06.830 --> 04:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
then it goes to Superior Court and they
 
04:48:09.750 --> 04:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
have to follow due process in the
 
04:48:11.830 --> 04:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution and also I just want to
 
04:48:15.910 --> 04:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
mention that the taxpayers are evidently
 
04:48:18.470 --> 04:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
going to be on the hook for a lot of
 
04:48:21.548 --> 04:48:21.558 align:start position:0%
this abuse and Corruption that has
 
04:48:25.030 --> 04:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
happened and so if we go to something A
 
04:48:27.510 --> 04:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
system that works better uh like the
 
04:48:30.230 --> 04:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
mediation and the superior court that
 
04:48:33.230 --> 04:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
will uh I think we're going to have the
 
04:48:34.990 --> 04:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are going to have to pay a ton
 
04:48:38.948 --> 04:48:38.958 align:start position:0%
of money but uh maybe in the future in
 
04:48:41.670 --> 04:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
some of this abuse and the and trying to
 
04:48:44.350 --> 04:48:44.360 align:start position:0%
rectify it through claims and so forth
 
04:48:46.708 --> 04:48:46.718 align:start position:0%
so those are the reasons that I support
 
04:48:49.350 --> 04:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
the Bill thank you thank you well spoken
 
04:48:51.150 --> 04:48:51.160 align:start position:0%
uh we have a
 
04:48:54.030 --> 04:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
mediator thing now where people can go
 
04:48:55.590 --> 04:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
and try to work it out and it only goes
 
04:48:57.230 --> 04:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
to court when that doesn't work or they
 
04:48:58.910 --> 04:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to do
 
04:49:01.830 --> 04:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
it well something isn't working right
 
04:49:04.430 --> 04:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
now because otherwise why are we having
 
04:49:09.070 --> 04:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
all these um te horror stories
 
04:49:11.350 --> 04:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
basically well I don't know about that
 
04:49:13.510 --> 04:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
but I do know there's a lot of cases now
 
04:49:15.110 --> 04:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
and that's because the divorce rate's
 
04:49:15.120 --> 04:49:15.948 align:start position:0%
and that's because the divorce rate's
about

04:49:15.948 --> 04:49:15.958 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:49:20.230 --> 04:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
50% but um we do have a mediator program
 
04:49:23.190 --> 04:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
going on before they get to Family Court
 
04:49:26.070 --> 04:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
are people advised of this you know you
 
04:49:28.708 --> 04:49:28.718 align:start position:0%
can do this first I'm
 
04:49:31.030 --> 04:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
wondering why we have somebody who
 
04:49:33.190 --> 04:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
actually knows other than me I don't
 
04:49:35.070 --> 04:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
know so would you believe that my
 
04:49:37.270 --> 04:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
daughter is going through a divorce and
 
04:49:38.990 --> 04:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
for a year has been involved in
 
04:49:41.670 --> 04:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
mediation and it's still ongoing so I
 
04:49:43.788 --> 04:49:43.798 align:start position:0%
don't I'm not sure how this bill is
 
04:49:46.628 --> 04:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
going to help speed up any processes
 
04:49:49.230 --> 04:49:49.240 align:start position:0%
because she has been with mediation
 
04:49:52.750 --> 04:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
which is very costly to her and when he
 
04:49:54.670 --> 04:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to agree to something then
 
04:49:57.788 --> 04:49:57.798 align:start position:0%
it becomes more costly to her so I'm not
 
04:50:00.548 --> 04:50:00.558 align:start position:0%
quite sure how this and she sees no end
 
04:50:03.030 --> 04:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
in sight right they just schedule
 
04:50:05.628 --> 04:50:05.638 align:start position:0%
another mediation appointment four
 
04:50:08.310 --> 04:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
months down the road so I don't see how
 
04:50:11.868 --> 04:50:11.878 align:start position:0%
this this by having everyone go through
 
04:50:16.150 --> 04:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
mediation would um speed up the process
 
04:50:18.310 --> 04:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
well it would be voluntary so I think
 
04:50:20.670 --> 04:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
that's the key thing if they choose to
 
04:50:22.830 --> 04:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
do it and maybe I don't know how many
 
04:50:26.670 --> 04:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
would or advise maybe it's a better idea
 
04:50:30.070 --> 04:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
but it could help follow up Mr chair
 
04:50:33.470 --> 04:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
follow up so this was ordered by the
 
04:50:36.150 --> 04:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
court she didn't voluntarily go that
 
04:50:39.070 --> 04:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
this mediation was ordered by the court
 
04:50:42.788 --> 04:50:42.798 align:start position:0%
for her uh under this bill it is it is
 
04:50:45.990 --> 04:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
voluntary so if they don't agree to it
 
04:50:47.830 --> 04:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
then it goes right to the superior court
 
04:50:50.230 --> 04:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
and they have to follow due process I
 
04:50:52.390 --> 04:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
think that that's the difference here
 
04:50:54.150 --> 04:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
and if they have to follow everything
 
04:50:55.670 --> 04:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
exactly as it's listen I've read The
 
04:50:58.310 --> 04:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence book five times and if
 
04:51:01.070 --> 04:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
they have to follow various
 
04:51:03.510 --> 04:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
things I've read it five times and I'm
 
04:51:05.510 --> 04:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
not sure I could do it so I'm just
 
04:51:08.350 --> 04:51:08.360 align:start position:0%
wondering what does this do in in
 
04:51:11.350 --> 04:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
Superior Court you have to hire EXP Ive
 
04:51:13.868 --> 04:51:13.878 align:start position:0%
lawyer um I'm just trying to get my hand
 
04:51:16.868 --> 04:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
around this here well following due
 
04:51:20.230 --> 04:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
process I think giving everybody a CH a
 
04:51:24.230 --> 04:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
chance to present it uh so each side
 
04:51:26.750 --> 04:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
feels like they got a fair shot I think
 
04:51:28.910 --> 04:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
that's the difference here and and
 
04:51:31.868 --> 04:51:31.878 align:start position:0%
following the Constitution okay any
 
04:51:31.878 --> 04:51:32.868 align:start position:0%
following the Constitution okay any
other

04:51:32.868 --> 04:51:32.878 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:51:36.070 --> 04:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you Katrina
 
04:51:36.080 --> 04:51:44.868 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you Katrina
Heinrich

04:51:44.868 --> 04:51:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:58.910 --> 04:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:01.390 --> 04:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
handouts if there's only one of each
 
04:52:03.470 --> 04:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
they go to the clerk of the committee
 
04:52:06.948 --> 04:52:06.958 align:start position:0%
for filing thank you you didn't I like
 
04:52:08.510 --> 04:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
how you kept that going right along
 
04:52:20.868 --> 04:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:22.990 --> 04:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
we have had a history of people
 
04:52:37.788 --> 04:52:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:39.910 --> 04:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
things he miss Hinrich while they're

you for having me again welcome I'm
 
04:52:49.390 --> 04:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
Katrina Heinrich and
 
04:52:53.708 --> 04:52:53.718 align:start position:0%
um I was asked by the bill sponsor to
 
04:52:55.390 --> 04:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
provide some data for you guys to look
 
04:52:57.510 --> 04:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
at which is on its way
 
04:53:01.150 --> 04:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
around and some of it is critical in the
 
04:53:01.160 --> 04:53:02.590 align:start position:0%
around and some of it is critical in the
way

04:53:02.590 --> 04:53:02.600 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:53:04.708 --> 04:53:04.718 align:start position:0%
that those of us that's been working on
 
04:53:06.030 --> 04:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
this for quite a long time have been
 
04:53:08.070 --> 04:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
using a methodology that's very similar
 
04:53:10.750 --> 04:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
to the doj has to have three three
 
04:53:13.470 --> 04:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
verifiable things has to be detectable
 
04:53:16.270 --> 04:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
has to be verifiable and it has to be
 
04:53:19.270 --> 04:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
quantifiable so for application if
 
04:53:21.868 --> 04:53:21.878 align:start position:0%
there's a pattern there's a pattern and
 
04:53:23.548 --> 04:53:23.558 align:start position:0%
then you guys can go ahead and educate
 
04:53:24.868 --> 04:53:24.878 align:start position:0%
yourself on the little blib they have
 
04:53:26.350 --> 04:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
for the rest of
 
04:53:29.430 --> 04:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
it the next
 
04:53:33.190 --> 04:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
sheet is actually a graph I put together
 
04:53:36.510 --> 04:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
for you and this is case profile
 
04:53:39.110 --> 04:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
samplings this is I can't even tell you
 
04:53:40.510 --> 04:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
how many cases we went through on this
 
04:53:43.670 --> 04:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
this um to form these patterns to
 
04:53:46.470 --> 04:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
discover what exactly is going on and
 
04:53:49.030 --> 04:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
comparing it to what they're saying
 
04:53:50.670 --> 04:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
which is often and you guys know this
 
04:53:54.230 --> 04:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's very emotional for them um but we
 
04:53:56.470 --> 04:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
need to put it into a data we needed to
 
04:53:58.750 --> 04:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
find a way to do that so we had to find
 
04:54:01.590 --> 04:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
words that made sense and this is the
 
04:54:03.990 --> 04:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
chart that you've got if you'll notice
 
04:54:05.390 --> 04:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
at the end of the chart there's a little
 
04:54:08.788 --> 04:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
key that says um Na equals does not
 
04:54:11.230 --> 04:54:11.240 align:start position:0%
apply kind of common one
 
04:54:14.628 --> 04:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
but it was much easier on this chart to
 
04:54:16.948 --> 04:54:16.958 align:start position:0%
put in the three things that didn't
 
04:54:20.070 --> 04:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
apply than fill in the whole chart with
 
04:54:23.990 --> 04:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
x's and what this is at the top is those
 
04:54:27.030 --> 04:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
a through G are actual
 
04:54:30.030 --> 04:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
cases those are the years of the cases
 
04:54:33.030 --> 04:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
so it's a huge sampling it's different
 
04:54:36.750 --> 04:54:36.760 align:start position:0%
courts another sampling and yet we found
 
04:54:39.070 --> 04:54:39.080 align:start position:0%
the same patterns being reported in
 
04:54:43.070 --> 04:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
these cases all always resulting in the
 
04:54:45.590 --> 04:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
child being abused a parent being abused
 
04:54:49.470 --> 04:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
or both parents even being abused um so
 
04:54:51.230 --> 04:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
this chart really gives you kind of
 
04:54:54.990 --> 04:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
insight into the layers of it the theme
 
04:54:57.350 --> 04:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
of this is that the family court was
 
04:55:00.110 --> 04:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
unsustainable in about 2007 they started
 
04:55:03.430 --> 04:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
realizing they did not have enough
 
04:55:05.628 --> 04:55:05.638 align:start position:0%
families in need to support under title
 
04:55:10.990 --> 04:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
4 so there was um an upswing shall we
 
04:55:14.868 --> 04:55:14.878 align:start position:0%
say in looking for cases in higher
 
04:55:17.830 --> 04:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
income families and I believe that
 
04:55:20.310 --> 04:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi handed you one
 
04:55:24.628 --> 04:55:24.638 align:start position:0%
of those people who is a judge
 
04:55:27.868 --> 04:55:27.878 align:start position:0%
and targeting started there now with
 
04:55:30.190 --> 04:55:30.200 align:start position:0%
that said I did comparison with the
 
04:55:32.708 --> 04:55:32.718 align:start position:0%
state of Minnesota Minnesota found the
 
04:55:35.030 --> 04:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
exact same upswing at the exact same
 
04:55:37.270 --> 04:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
time and the swing has never stopped
 
04:55:40.470 --> 04:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
it's continued so 20 seconds yep this
 
04:55:43.750 --> 04:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
chart gives you that and the last page
 
04:55:46.788 --> 04:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
because we keep talking a lot about how
 
04:55:48.510 --> 04:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
these cases
 
04:55:51.910 --> 04:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
are shall we say artificially created
 
04:55:54.628 --> 04:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
and they have a lot of high
 
04:55:56.670 --> 04:55:56.680 align:start position:0%
conflict when we hear about we hear
 
04:55:58.070 --> 04:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
about high conflict as in there's
 
04:55:59.750 --> 04:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
something wrong but in this particular
 
04:56:02.470 --> 04:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
case this is from Cohen and winter and
 
04:56:03.750 --> 04:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
they were looking at
 
04:56:08.830 --> 04:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
HB HB um 185 for the parental rights
 
04:56:11.270 --> 04:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
yeah and they respond to it in their own
 
04:56:14.110 --> 04:56:14.120 align:start position:0%
blog and you'll look at the bottom the
 
04:56:15.868 --> 04:56:15.878 align:start position:0%
bottom yellow you guys we're going to
 
04:56:17.470 --> 04:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
take a look at that do you will you
 
04:56:18.708 --> 04:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
accept any
 
04:56:22.430 --> 04:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
questions qu any questions
 
04:56:24.990 --> 04:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you your
 
04:56:28.708 --> 04:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
testimony excuse me Mr chairman could I
 
04:56:30.628 --> 04:56:30.638 align:start position:0%
just request I don't know what's going
 
04:56:32.750 --> 04:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
on but there's just never enough copies
 
04:56:33.868 --> 04:56:33.878 align:start position:0%
to reach
 
04:56:36.470 --> 04:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
me well sometimes they don't reach me
 
04:56:40.990 --> 04:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:42.230 --> 04:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
give it to
 
04:56:45.708 --> 04:56:45.718 align:start position:0%
me it dis does a disservice to the
 
04:56:47.868 --> 04:56:47.878 align:start position:0%
person testifying if there are not
 
04:56:50.190 --> 04:56:50.200 align:start position:0%
enough copies for the people in the room
 
04:56:52.788 --> 04:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't help their case basically
 
04:56:54.230 --> 04:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's their problem to
 
04:56:58.510 --> 04:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
solve yeah um Mr chairman I think um
 
04:57:00.868 --> 04:57:00.878 align:start position:0%
maybe not everyone is aware that we need
 
04:57:03.868 --> 04:57:03.878 align:start position:0%
one copy for the file so maybe that's
 
04:57:06.470 --> 04:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
why you're getting
 
04:57:10.708 --> 04:57:10.718 align:start position:0%
short okay the chair recognizes Cullen
 
04:57:16.670 --> 04:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:19.270 --> 04:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
minutes not seeing a Drew

include two Supreme Court appeals one of
 
04:58:10.830 --> 04:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
which dealt with the eth circuit in Keen
 
04:58:12.628 --> 04:58:12.638 align:start position:0%
stealing my parental rights on
 
04:58:14.750 --> 04:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and basic religious rights
 
04:58:17.390 --> 04:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
to exempt my 8-year-old from being
 
04:58:19.910 --> 04:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
abused with the covid-19 jab and thus
 
04:58:24.868 --> 04:58:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:29.670 --> 04:58:29.680 align:start position:0%

court as well I'll even give you
 
04:58:36.548 --> 04:58:36.558 align:start position:0%
permission to see the sealed stuff if we
 
04:58:37.830 --> 04:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:58:40.590 --> 04:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
Judicial uh oversight
 
04:58:41.990 --> 04:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
04:58:44.030 --> 04:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
upheld this blatant abuse of my basic
 
04:58:45.590 --> 04:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
rights and my daughter's health and
 
04:58:47.548 --> 04:58:47.558 align:start position:0%
safety making law from the bench and
 
04:58:49.750 --> 04:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
denying basic rights is an anathema to
 
04:58:52.110 --> 04:58:52.120 align:start position:0%
our way of life we petition our
 
04:58:54.230 --> 04:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
grievances to this body year after year
 
04:58:56.510 --> 04:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
decade after decade so that this body
 
04:58:58.230 --> 04:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
will reign in the lawlessness in the
 
04:59:00.350 --> 04:59:00.360 align:start position:0%
Judiciary which as history has shown is
 
04:59:01.868 --> 04:59:01.878 align:start position:0%
the most corrupt branch in the New
 
04:59:03.868 --> 04:59:03.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire government and the few bills
 
04:59:05.670 --> 04:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
you manage to pass are watered down and
 
04:59:07.830 --> 04:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
Toothless our civil rights are being

04:59:50.070 --> 04:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon sir thank you for
 
04:59:53.470 --> 04:59:53.480 align:start position:0%
recognizing me for three minutes uh to
 
04:59:55.150 --> 04:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
begin I'd like to say that the word
 
04:59:57.868 --> 04:59:57.878 align:start position:0%
court is used improperly these so-called
 
05:00:00.390 --> 05:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
family courts are not courts that's TW
 
05:00:03.470 --> 05:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
total 42 USC 666 they are
 
05:00:05.788 --> 05:00:05.798 align:start position:0%
administrative expedited administrative
 
05:00:08.548 --> 05:00:08.558 align:start position:0%
and judicial procedure that is an
 
05:00:11.830 --> 05:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
article to uh procedure it is not a
 
05:00:14.750 --> 05:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
court of law it is for the adjudication
 
05:00:18.548 --> 05:00:18.558 align:start position:0%
of a of a public entitlement either of
 
05:00:21.670 --> 05:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
child support from the state or of
 
05:00:24.868 --> 05:00:24.878 align:start position:0%
foster care uh managed by the state it
 
05:00:27.310 --> 05:00:27.320 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with private rights
 
05:00:29.788 --> 05:00:29.798 align:start position:0%
that is why they are not courts of law
 
05:00:33.230 --> 05:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
under article 3 next I want to say that
 
05:00:35.230 --> 05:00:35.240 align:start position:0%
the persons who are involved in those
 
05:00:38.590 --> 05:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
courts so-called courts are incentivized
 
05:00:42.070 --> 05:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
by quote in incentive payments computed
 
05:00:44.470 --> 05:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
as a percentage of child support
 
05:00:48.548 --> 05:00:48.558 align:start position:0%
collections that's 45 fcr
 
05:00:52.788 --> 05:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
30412 that is a that is essentially an
 
05:00:55.470 --> 05:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
illegal act conducted by an officer
 
05:00:57.830 --> 05:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
because they are being false they're
 
05:01:00.708 --> 05:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
they're being corruptly influenced uh to
 
05:01:03.430 --> 05:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
give one side of the family more
 
05:01:06.670 --> 05:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
parenting time in order to obtain a
 
05:01:10.230 --> 05:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
greater child support um ruling which
 
05:01:12.230 --> 05:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
will benefit the state's
 
05:01:16.070 --> 05:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
agency um but and and the persons who
 
05:01:18.670 --> 05:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
are doing this you you're right they're
 
05:01:21.788 --> 05:01:21.798 align:start position:0%
not necessarily JDS but I'll tell you
 
05:01:26.310 --> 05:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
something else they are not in fact
 
05:01:28.868 --> 05:01:28.878 align:start position:0%
acting on in their behalf as judicial
 
05:01:30.868 --> 05:01:30.878 align:start position:0%
officers because that would be a
 
05:01:35.030 --> 05:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
violation of separation of of uh of
 
05:01:40.750 --> 05:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
powers Doctrine they're not acting as
 
05:01:45.430 --> 05:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
judicial officers um and even if they
 
05:01:48.350 --> 05:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
are a Judicial officer what they are
 
05:01:51.230 --> 05:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
acting under is a interdepartmental
 
05:01:54.070 --> 05:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
service agreement between them and the
 
05:01:56.510 --> 05:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
agency of the state responsible for
 
05:01:59.670 --> 05:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
collecting the money under F title 4D or
 
05:02:02.868 --> 05:02:02.878 align:start position:0%
or title uh four which brings me to uh
 
05:02:07.070 --> 05:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
the other uh point is that chapter sub
 
05:02:10.548 --> 05:02:10.558 align:start position:0%
chapter 4 is entitled Grant to States
 
05:02:13.708 --> 05:02:13.718 align:start position:0%
for Aid and services to needy families
 
05:02:17.030 --> 05:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
with children and for child welfare
 
05:02:20.670 --> 05:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
services meaning that it should not be
 
05:02:23.628 --> 05:02:23.638 align:start position:0%
applied to normal people who have
 
05:02:26.150 --> 05:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise functional families and who
 
05:02:28.830 --> 05:02:28.840 align:start position:0%
are otherwise financially
 
05:02:32.270 --> 05:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
solvent it is this misapplication of the
 
05:02:35.310 --> 05:02:35.320 align:start position:0%
law that is that that is the most
 
05:02:37.990 --> 05:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
concerning to me because the law is
 
05:02:40.788 --> 05:02:40.798 align:start position:0%
actually written quite well it allows
 
05:02:43.788 --> 05:02:43.798 align:start position:0%
the state to take care of the most needy
 
05:02:45.868 --> 05:02:45.878 align:start position:0%
and most vulnerable members of society
 
05:02:48.350 --> 05:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
15 seconds however it has been corrupted
 
05:02:51.868 --> 05:02:51.878 align:start position:0%
to be applied to everyone which means
 
05:02:56.510 --> 05:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
that that um it is used to to profit
 
05:02:59.150 --> 05:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
those who are in charge of of of
 
05:03:01.548 --> 05:03:01.558 align:start position:0%
administrating those
 
05:03:03.868 --> 05:03:03.878 align:start position:0%
things thank you for your testimony
 
05:03:05.350 --> 05:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
could you print that
 
05:03:07.750 --> 05:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
out I mean I don't think I will send you
 
05:03:09.910 --> 05:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
an email give me about 24 hours sure
 
05:03:12.070 --> 05:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
enough I mean there's some good stuff in
 
05:03:14.628 --> 05:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
there I want to check out it's the truth
 
05:03:16.590 --> 05:03:16.600 align:start position:0%
well let's maybe if it's truth that's
 
05:03:18.910 --> 05:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
good stuff and and the people are are
 
05:03:21.310 --> 05:03:21.320 align:start position:0%
not told this so they feel like the
 
05:03:23.390 --> 05:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
quote unquote judge is doing them wrong
 
05:03:25.110 --> 05:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
but in fact would you take some
 
05:03:27.110 --> 05:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
questions CU your time is up I'm afraid
 
05:03:30.350 --> 05:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
any questions nope thank you I'm looking
 
05:03:33.190 --> 05:03:33.200 align:start position:0%

05:03:59.868 --> 05:03:59.878 align:start position:0%
and you know what I did when I testified
 
05:04:02.030 --> 05:04:02.040 align:start position:0%

wholeheartedly um it really is Family
 
05:05:31.830 --> 05:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
Division should be abolished and there
 
05:05:34.708 --> 05:05:34.718 align:start position:0%
should be this family uh office of
 
05:05:36.470 --> 05:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
family mediation with professional
 
05:05:39.628 --> 05:05:39.638 align:start position:0%
mediators psychiatrist or psychologists
 
05:05:41.948 --> 05:05:41.958 align:start position:0%
I know mediation doesn't work you know
 
05:05:45.990 --> 05:05:46.000 align:start position:0%

professionals the Family Division for
 
05:05:50.190 --> 05:05:50.200 align:start position:0%
example I've had experience in this over
 
05:05:53.670 --> 05:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
the past four years um they'll have 30
 
05:05:56.788 --> 05:05:56.798 align:start position:0%
minute hearings on office of proof with
 
05:05:59.230 --> 05:05:59.240 align:start position:0%
multiple motions at the same time that
 
05:06:02.830 --> 05:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
gives each side 15 minutes to make a
 
05:06:04.830 --> 05:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
presentation to the court there's no
 
05:06:06.470 --> 05:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
checks or balances because you don't
 
05:06:08.590 --> 05:06:08.600 align:start position:0%
know what the other side may say to
 
05:06:10.070 --> 05:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
counteract it
 
05:06:13.390 --> 05:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
you can have clients or people making
 
05:06:16.310 --> 05:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
with a narcissistic personality wanting
 
05:06:18.430 --> 05:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
absolute control over the children will
 
05:06:20.030 --> 05:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
do anything to get it and say anything
 
05:06:23.990 --> 05:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
to get it if a judge um does not like
 
05:06:26.110 --> 05:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
you in the first instance to some extent
 
05:06:29.830 --> 05:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
or has some type of attitude towards you
 
05:06:32.990 --> 05:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
you can't change it and the problem a
 
05:06:35.350 --> 05:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
big problem in the family division
 
05:06:35.360 --> 05:06:36.868 align:start position:0%
big problem in the family division
is

05:06:36.868 --> 05:06:36.878 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:06:39.708 --> 05:06:39.718 align:start position:0%
the if if you're on the wrong side for
 
05:06:42.868 --> 05:06:42.878 align:start position:0%
any reason attitude or whatever the
 
05:06:46.150 --> 05:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
judge will pontificate in its orders and
 
05:06:49.230 --> 05:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
I I mean pontificate so that if you
 
05:06:51.070 --> 05:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to challenge it if you want to go
 
05:06:53.390 --> 05:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
further on whether the Supreme Court or
 
05:06:56.110 --> 05:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
whatever in instances they they they
 
05:06:59.788 --> 05:06:59.798 align:start position:0%
justified in there um there
 
05:07:02.910 --> 05:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
is um I'm trying
 
05:07:06.548 --> 05:07:06.558 align:start position:0%
to one there's discussion for example of
 
05:07:09.030 --> 05:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
of interrogatories in Discovery in the
 
05:07:09.040 --> 05:07:10.430 align:start position:0%
of interrogatories in Discovery in the
50s

05:07:10.430 --> 05:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
50s
 
05:07:14.708 --> 05:07:14.718 align:start position:0%
50 uh interrogative submit well if a
 
05:07:18.708 --> 05:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
judge says fav one side and that side
 
05:07:18.718 --> 05:07:20.230 align:start position:0%
judge says fav one side and that side
submitted

05:07:20.230 --> 05:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
05:07:23.510 --> 05:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
156 in subp Parts the judge said well
 
05:07:26.350 --> 05:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
that doesn't count the subp parts if
 
05:07:29.990 --> 05:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
this rule 125 required disclosures if
 
05:07:32.430 --> 05:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
the other side wants to play games with
 
05:07:35.390 --> 05:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
Discovery they'll say he didn't provide
 
05:07:37.548 --> 05:07:37.558 align:start position:0%
this or she didn't provide this one item
 
05:07:39.628 --> 05:07:39.638 align:start position:0%
and the judge will say you can't do to
 
05:07:41.590 --> 05:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
Discovery you can't take depositions
 
05:07:44.310 --> 05:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
until you comply with 125 but that's a
 
05:07:46.948 --> 05:07:46.958 align:start position:0%
single individual making a judgment call
 
05:07:48.948 --> 05:07:48.958 align:start position:0%
and as I say to you if there's if
 
05:07:51.350 --> 05:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
there's an attitude against you it
 
05:07:54.510 --> 05:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
really protracts one gentleman said
 
05:07:57.590 --> 05:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
protracted divorces more creates more
 
05:07:59.670 --> 05:07:59.680 align:start position:0%

berno do I have it
 
05:08:20.150 --> 05:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
right the name
 
05:08:23.548 --> 05:08:23.558 align:start position:0%
burs oh like you wrote somebody else
 
05:08:27.310 --> 05:08:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:32.030 --> 05:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
wrote uh thank you um I come here today
 
05:08:33.750 --> 05:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
to give you a bit of a perspective from
 
05:08:35.390 --> 05:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
someone who has practiced law in New
 
05:08:37.150 --> 05:08:37.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a little closer to the mic sir
 
05:08:39.628 --> 05:08:39.638 align:start position:0%
for the ancient of years for 23 three
 
05:08:40.910 --> 05:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
years I've been practicing law in New
 
05:08:43.270 --> 05:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I give you the perspective
 
05:08:45.830 --> 05:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
of an attorney's view here as you
 
05:08:47.270 --> 05:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
probably know there are three levels in
 
05:08:49.230 --> 05:08:49.240 align:start position:0%
the court system here Supreme Court
 
05:08:51.510 --> 05:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
being the highest intermediate is your
 
05:08:53.910 --> 05:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
appell at County courts the superior
 
05:08:56.150 --> 05:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
court and your entry level is your
 
05:08:58.910 --> 05:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
circuit court comprised of the probate
 
05:09:02.510 --> 05:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
family court and District division now
 
05:09:04.948 --> 05:09:04.958 align:start position:0%
for reasons I still haven't figured out
 
05:09:07.230 --> 05:09:07.240 align:start position:0%
after 23 years of practice the technical
 
05:09:10.270 --> 05:09:10.280 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence don't apply in the
 
05:09:12.948 --> 05:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
cases I still don't get it I get the
 
05:09:15.070 --> 05:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
theory behind it is you don't want
 
05:09:17.590 --> 05:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
children placed on
 
05:09:20.990 --> 05:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
technicalities but the reality is there
 
05:09:24.310 --> 05:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
is somebody a gatekeeper the judge who's
 
05:09:26.430 --> 05:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
going to tell you what you can let in
 
05:09:29.110 --> 05:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
and what you cannot let in and under the
 
05:09:32.390 --> 05:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
current system it has to be material and
 
05:09:35.750 --> 05:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
relevant and you get a ton of evidence
 
05:09:38.628 --> 05:09:38.638 align:start position:0%
based on emotion and you're getting
 
05:09:40.868 --> 05:09:40.878 align:start position:0%
decisions based on emotion because
 
05:09:42.030 --> 05:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
nobody is
 
05:09:44.830 --> 05:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
explaining you can't let what the
 
05:09:47.670 --> 05:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
exhibits in that have no probative value
 
05:09:49.868 --> 05:09:49.878 align:start position:0%
and that should be explained to them and
 
05:09:49.878 --> 05:09:50.948 align:start position:0%
and that should be explained to them and
it's

05:09:50.948 --> 05:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:09:53.708 --> 05:09:53.718 align:start position:0%
not in addition to the lack of
 
05:09:58.510 --> 05:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
evidential rules There is almost no
 
05:10:01.430 --> 05:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
appellant oversight here in certain
 
05:10:03.510 --> 05:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
cases there was a time where you could
 
05:10:06.230 --> 05:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
take an appeal a denovo appeal from the
 
05:10:07.910 --> 05:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
family court to Superior Court
 
05:10:09.990 --> 05:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
specifically abuse and neglect cases
 
05:10:12.708 --> 05:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
but some years ago that Avenue was
 
05:10:15.430 --> 05:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
eliminated now your vast majority almost
 
05:10:17.670 --> 05:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
exclusively appeals from the Family
 
05:10:20.868 --> 05:10:20.878 align:start position:0%
Division go to the Supreme Court
 
05:10:23.230 --> 05:10:23.240 align:start position:0%
straight to the Supreme Court and the
 
05:10:27.030 --> 05:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
odds of the Supreme Court taking your
 
05:10:29.390 --> 05:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
run-of-the-mill disagreement in a
 
05:10:31.868 --> 05:10:31.878 align:start position:0%
marital case is almost
 
05:10:34.310 --> 05:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
non-existent unless there's a new
 
05:10:36.270 --> 05:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
statute that needs to be
 
05:10:38.990 --> 05:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
interpreted and everybody needs that
 
05:10:41.430 --> 05:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
view you from the Supreme Court it's
 
05:10:43.548 --> 05:10:43.558 align:start position:0%
almost always you're going to get a a
 
05:10:45.190 --> 05:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
form letter from the Superior Court
 
05:10:47.430 --> 05:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
that's the Supreme Court rather that
 
05:10:49.310 --> 05:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
says the best Court in the position to
 
05:10:51.030 --> 05:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
determine the credibility of witnesses
 
05:10:54.350 --> 05:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
and evaluate evidence is trial court so
 
05:10:56.868 --> 05:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
we're not going to disturb their
 
05:11:01.350 --> 05:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
findings so compare that to the federal
 
05:11:04.230 --> 05:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
scheme which essentially says all of
 
05:11:05.948 --> 05:11:05.958 align:start position:0%
your federal rights come in different
 
05:11:08.230 --> 05:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
shapes and sizes they're not all equally
 
05:11:11.670 --> 05:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
important your fundamental rights are
 
05:11:14.430 --> 05:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
your most important parenting rights are
 
05:11:16.390 --> 05:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
in that group so they're subject to the
 
05:11:18.110 --> 05:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
St strictest
 
05:11:21.150 --> 05:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
scrutiny and the current system I I see
 
05:11:24.948 --> 05:11:24.958 align:start position:0%
she's showing you the watch this oh half
 
05:11:27.510 --> 05:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
about hour feel strike that half a
 
05:11:31.070 --> 05:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
minute so the US Supreme Court has
 
05:11:34.590 --> 05:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
determined in the case of tville that
 
05:11:38.628 --> 05:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
parents are deemed to be fit parents
 
05:11:40.310 --> 05:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
unless the the state has proven
 
05:11:42.510 --> 05:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise and what you currently have in
 
05:11:44.948 --> 05:11:44.958 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect cases coming forward
 
05:11:47.628 --> 05:11:47.638 align:start position:0%
is you can have a non- accused parent
 
05:11:50.150 --> 05:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
who wants to get their child back but
 
05:11:52.830 --> 05:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
under the current statutory scheme they
 
05:11:55.830 --> 05:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
actually have to file a request and the
 
05:11:57.868 --> 05:11:57.878 align:start position:0%
court will schedule a parental Fitness
 
05:12:00.310 --> 05:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
hearing for that parent who's non
 
05:12:03.548 --> 05:12:03.558 align:start position:0%
Accused by the state to try to prove to
 
05:12:06.430 --> 05:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
the family judge that they are adequate
 
05:12:07.750 --> 05:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
to take their child back when they're
 
05:12:13.708 --> 05:12:13.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:15.990 --> 05:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
05:12:19.990 --> 05:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
for counil just a couple of statements
 
05:12:22.548 --> 05:12:22.558 align:start position:0%
um I am working with and I'm going to
 
05:12:24.590 --> 05:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
blank it out but it's I think it's the
 
05:12:27.750 --> 05:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Bar Association is working
 
05:12:32.310 --> 05:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
with me to produce an intro book for
 
05:12:34.948 --> 05:12:34.958 align:start position:0%
people who are going prosay and I've
 
05:12:37.628 --> 05:12:37.638 align:start position:0%
been talking with their executive
 
05:12:40.150 --> 05:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
director to see what can we put in it
 
05:12:42.390 --> 05:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
because I there are materials but I'm
 
05:12:45.510 --> 05:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
not quite sure many people are knowing
 
05:12:47.708 --> 05:12:47.718 align:start position:0%
about that much less getting them but
 
05:12:50.628 --> 05:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
that will speak to the issue of why did
 
05:12:52.670 --> 05:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
they do that and what do I do next and
 
05:12:54.990 --> 05:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
if this then what doesn't solve every
 
05:12:57.430 --> 05:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
problem but it will solve maybe a few
 
05:12:59.430 --> 05:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
and you might also be interested to know
 
05:13:01.230 --> 05:13:01.240 align:start position:0%
that I've been given the authority to
 
05:13:04.190 --> 05:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
make a subcommittee out of this
 
05:13:06.910 --> 05:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
committee we'll probably stand it up um
 
05:13:09.270 --> 05:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
April or May to pick up the good work
 
05:13:10.990 --> 05:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
that was started in the special
 
05:13:13.150 --> 05:13:13.160 align:start position:0%
committee on the Family Division of
 
05:13:15.590 --> 05:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court yeah we were putting
 
05:13:18.270 --> 05:13:18.280 align:start position:0%
Band-Aids and you know what it did some
 
05:13:21.868 --> 05:13:21.878 align:start position:0%
good job did good job doing good work I
 
05:13:24.470 --> 05:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
think we're going to do some more so
 
05:13:28.030 --> 05:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and uh seeing nothing
 
05:13:32.350 --> 05:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:35.310 --> 05:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
counselor chair recognizes Brooke low
 
05:13:35.320 --> 05:13:46.270 align:start position:0%
counselor chair recognizes Brooke low
farmer

05:13:46.270 --> 05:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:48.150 --> 05:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
hello this is quite intimidating I'll be
 
05:13:51.190 --> 05:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
honest um when I was asked to come um by
 
05:13:55.150 --> 05:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
the representative I said I was very
 
05:13:57.390 --> 05:13:57.400 align:start position:0%
apprehensive to come and share my story
 
05:14:00.110 --> 05:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
as my another father mentioned my case
 
05:14:01.830 --> 05:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
is currently ongoing and has been
 
05:14:04.150 --> 05:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
ongoing for three
 
05:14:08.350 --> 05:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
years um so I guess I'll just tell you
 
05:14:10.470 --> 05:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
part of my story because it it echoes a
 
05:14:12.750 --> 05:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
lot that's already been said so I'll try
 
05:14:15.910 --> 05:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
and be quick for you chairman um two and
 
05:14:17.670 --> 05:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
a half minutes so letter a rule all
 
05:14:19.788 --> 05:14:19.798 align:start position:0%
right okay my case is out of the 9th
 
05:14:23.190 --> 05:14:23.200 align:start position:0%
District uh Family Division um the judge
 
05:14:24.910 --> 05:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
has presided over my family case since
 
05:14:27.750 --> 05:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
the beginning in September of 2021 the
 
05:14:29.628 --> 05:14:29.638 align:start position:0%
judge's rulings over this case
 
05:14:31.670 --> 05:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
demonstrate clear biased against women
 
05:14:33.628 --> 05:14:33.638 align:start position:0%
veterans and law
 
05:14:35.670 --> 05:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement this is my personal
 
05:14:37.948 --> 05:14:37.958 align:start position:0%
experience um in one proceeding the
 
05:14:39.708 --> 05:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
judge would cut me off and not even let
 
05:14:45.470 --> 05:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
me speak and another um it was my uh
 
05:14:48.270 --> 05:14:48.280 align:start position:0%
parenting plan that was being discussed
 
05:14:50.110 --> 05:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
I was employed as a police dispatcher
 
05:14:52.390 --> 05:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
after extensive background checks
 
05:14:54.830 --> 05:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
polygraph my ex-boyfriend the father of
 
05:14:57.150 --> 05:14:57.160 align:start position:0%
my child and his Council ultimately got
 
05:14:59.110 --> 05:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
me fired from my position due to slander
 
05:15:00.830 --> 05:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
subpoenas to my employer the police
 
05:15:02.990 --> 05:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
department sending private investigators
 
05:15:05.628 --> 05:15:05.638 align:start position:0%
to harass me while I was at work into my
 
05:15:09.830 --> 05:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
home the judge remarked in his ruling

these proceedings including falsely

stating I testified under oath that the

excellent attorney it seems allow
 
05:16:27.948 --> 05:16:27.958 align:start position:0%
perjury as with the case of my recent
 
05:16:30.628 --> 05:16:30.638 align:start position:0%
trial the father of my child made
 
05:16:32.070 --> 05:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
completely false statements that I
 
05:16:34.948 --> 05:16:34.958 align:start position:0%
easily disapproved by my testimony and
 
05:16:37.708 --> 05:16:37.718 align:start position:0%
evidence I presented the judge never
 
05:16:39.708 --> 05:16:39.718 align:start position:0%
addressed that either
 
05:16:41.510 --> 05:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
in his ruling he said the petitioner
 
05:16:43.310 --> 05:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
often times seemed unable to answer
 
05:16:45.190 --> 05:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
questions or confused you have 20
 
05:16:49.750 --> 05:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:53.230 --> 05:16:53.240 align:start position:0%

seconds you're on a roll thank you I

guess why I'm here is his last ruling
 
05:17:04.590 --> 05:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
this judge like we heard for so many
 
05:17:07.110 --> 05:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
others is made a biased decision that
 
05:17:08.868 --> 05:17:08.878 align:start position:0%
being in law enforcement for a woman
 
05:17:11.230 --> 05:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
woman and a mother was not okay he
 
05:17:13.110 --> 05:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
essentially ruled that the father would
 
05:17:14.430 --> 05:17:14.440 align:start position:0%
get the
 
05:17:16.470 --> 05:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
child his last ruling removed a
 
05:17:17.788 --> 05:17:17.798 align:start position:0%

daughter when my daughter was five I
 
05:20:14.990 --> 05:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
asked him to show some interest in her
 
05:20:16.628 --> 05:20:16.638 align:start position:0%
so he showed up at her school grabbed
 
05:20:18.430 --> 05:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
her and smashed her fa face against the

hearing and New Hampshire family court
 
05:20:39.548 --> 05:20:39.558 align:start position:0%
judge wrote I thought about granting M
 
05:20:41.990 --> 05:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
jono's request but then decided why
 
05:20:43.750 --> 05:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
bother since I already knew what I would
 
05:20:46.708 --> 05:20:46.718 align:start position:0%
decide another judge wrote openly wrote
 
05:20:48.590 --> 05:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
he wasn't interested in evidence and the

indefensible actions didn't stop there
 
05:20:58.990 --> 05:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
and a move many have ascribed as
 
05:21:01.310 --> 05:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
shocking the conscience this judge one

05:22:34.070 --> 05:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
about 27k to 57k and that's yearly
 
05:22:35.628 --> 05:22:35.638 align:start position:0%
depending on how much money a person
 
05:22:38.150 --> 05:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
does or does not have if a divorce case
 
05:22:41.948 --> 05:22:41.958 align:start position:0%
goes on for 4 years that can cost over
 
05:22:44.350 --> 05:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
$108,000 if a marriage license is so
 
05:22:47.030 --> 05:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
cheap why does a divorce cost so much in
 
05:22:48.670 --> 05:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
any civil courtroom you have the right
 
05:22:50.750 --> 05:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
to an attorney and a jury decides a
 
05:22:53.150 --> 05:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
verdict however in family courtroom the
 
05:22:55.830 --> 05:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
judge is the dominant one decision maker
 
05:22:57.430 --> 05:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
the constitution in the United States
 
05:22:59.708 --> 05:22:59.718 align:start position:0%
does not apply in Family Court a person
 
05:23:01.470 --> 05:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
does not have the right to an attorney
 
05:23:03.510 --> 05:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
and there is no jury when it comes to
 
05:23:05.190 --> 05:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
divorce with children involved the best
 
05:23:07.230 --> 05:23:07.240 align:start position:0%
interest for the child is equality
 
05:23:09.868 --> 05:23:09.878 align:start position:0%
between both parents that means 50/50
 
05:23:11.350 --> 05:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
the court system is not a friendly
 
05:23:12.990 --> 05:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
environment and does not work with
 
05:23:15.230 --> 05:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
equality seeing it with my own eyes
 
05:23:16.868 --> 05:23:16.878 align:start position:0%
attorneys encourage their clients to be
 
05:23:19.110 --> 05:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
aggressive as possible often encouraging
 
05:23:21.548 --> 05:23:21.558 align:start position:0%
their client to make accused accusations
 
05:23:23.470 --> 05:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
of course if someone is getting accused
 
05:23:25.430 --> 05:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
of something that they didn't do they're
 
05:23:27.670 --> 05:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
going to fight against it more fighting
 
05:23:29.548 --> 05:23:29.558 align:start position:0%
means more time in court more money
 
05:23:31.510 --> 05:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
spent and if a person does not fight
 
05:23:33.070 --> 05:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
they can lose everything and that
 
05:23:35.350 --> 05:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
includes his or her children the federal
 
05:23:37.510 --> 05:23:37.520 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair and members of the

committee uh my name is Dana alre uh I
 
05:24:51.230 --> 05:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
think you've heard a lot of the problems
 
05:24:53.708 --> 05:24:53.718 align:start position:0%
with the court from other people I would
 
05:24:57.190 --> 05:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
just add to that uh February 4th on
 
05:25:00.628 --> 05:25:00.638 align:start position:0%
House Bill 350 you also heard a problem
 
05:25:02.548 --> 05:25:02.558 align:start position:0%
wherein the chief J former Chief judge
 
05:25:05.430 --> 05:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
of the administrator Court uh who cannot
 
05:25:09.150 --> 05:25:09.160 align:start position:0%
be named uh committed uh perjury in his
 
05:25:13.708 --> 05:25:13.718 align:start position:0%
August 26 2022 deposition uh with intent
 
05:25:14.910 --> 05:25:14.920 align:start position:0%

transcripts uh for
 
05:25:23.628 --> 05:25:23.638 align:start position:0%
appeal that being said I'd sum up what I
 
05:25:27.110 --> 05:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
heard earlier is that uh our magistrates
 
05:25:30.430 --> 05:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
and officers of government are not
 
05:25:33.390 --> 05:25:33.400 align:start position:0%
accountable to the people at all times
 
05:25:37.150 --> 05:25:37.160 align:start position:0%
and uh rather than that uh we have this
 
05:25:40.110 --> 05:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
family court that constitute the private
 
05:25:43.548 --> 05:25:43.558 align:start position:0%
interest uh or ement of any one
 
05:25:48.150 --> 05:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
man uh family or class of men uh public
 
05:25:50.628 --> 05:25:50.638 align:start position:0%
Liberty is manifestly
 
05:25:53.948 --> 05:25:53.958 align:start position:0%
endangered thankfully we have this bill
 
05:25:57.030 --> 05:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
as an effectual means of redress please
 
05:25:59.948 --> 05:25:59.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:03.590 --> 05:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
bill the trouble though is wealthy men
 
05:26:06.070 --> 05:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
are sometimes difficult to convince as
 
05:26:09.030 --> 05:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
we've heard for 2,000 years
 
05:26:13.470 --> 05:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
when the rich man was unkind to
 
05:26:16.430 --> 05:26:16.440 align:start position:0%

sympathize with what your daughter has
 
05:27:50.990 --> 05:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
gone through I'm also a mom who adopted
 
05:27:54.590 --> 05:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
my two sons out of dcyf custody in total
 
05:27:57.070 --> 05:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
I have about 10 cases in the basement um
 
05:27:58.470 --> 05:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
probably about seven years in Family
 
05:28:00.270 --> 05:28:00.280 align:start position:0%
Court the one thing I want everyone to
 
05:28:02.788 --> 05:28:02.798 align:start position:0%
hear today is that it is a racket it is
 
05:28:04.390 --> 05:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
not in the best interest of the children
 
05:28:06.150 --> 05:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
it is not in the best interest of the
 
05:28:09.190 --> 05:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
families right now for every collected
 
05:28:12.150 --> 05:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
for child support the state gets
 
05:28:16.230 --> 05:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
$512 back from the federal government
 
05:28:18.990 --> 05:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
it's money driven it's not
 
05:28:20.868 --> 05:28:20.878 align:start position:0%
constitutional if you think about it
 
05:28:22.708 --> 05:28:22.718 align:start position:0%
what is the most corporal punishment
 
05:28:24.670 --> 05:28:24.680 align:start position:0%
thing you could do to an individual you
 
05:28:26.030 --> 05:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
could throw them in jail for life you
 
05:28:27.830 --> 05:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
could put them life to prison but I
 
05:28:29.948 --> 05:28:29.958 align:start position:0%
would say taking someone's child is
 
05:28:32.628 --> 05:28:32.638 align:start position:0%
right up there and we're doing that
 
05:28:32.638 --> 05:28:35.230 align:start position:0%
right up there and we're doing that
without

05:28:35.230 --> 05:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
without
 
05:28:37.230 --> 05:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional what our forefathers put
 
05:28:40.230 --> 05:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
in place we don't have a jury we have a
 
05:28:43.430 --> 05:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
judge who will decide whatever the heck
 
05:28:45.670 --> 05:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
he wants to do and I know I only have
 
05:28:46.868 --> 05:28:46.878 align:start position:0%
three minutes I'm going to go as quick
 
05:28:50.590 --> 05:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
as I can the most crazy most recent was
 
05:28:52.350 --> 05:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
my 10-year-old who I have permanent
 
05:28:54.830 --> 05:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
guardianship over his grandfather came
 
05:28:57.750 --> 05:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
out of left field he had been told by
 
05:28:59.830 --> 05:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
DCF he was not allowed to see this child
 
05:29:02.708 --> 05:29:02.718 align:start position:0%
because of evidence of sexual assault on
 
05:29:04.948 --> 05:29:04.958 align:start position:0%
this child he came out of leftfield and
 
05:29:08.150 --> 05:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
asked for grandfather visitation rights
 
05:29:10.190 --> 05:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
very clearly Define the RSA what he's
 
05:29:12.390 --> 05:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to do went in front of the judge
 
05:29:14.270 --> 05:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
the judge decided to give him a
 
05:29:16.548 --> 05:29:16.558 align:start position:0%
parenting plan that I was to give him
 
05:29:18.990 --> 05:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
his medical records his school records
 
05:29:21.230 --> 05:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
an update every week as to all of his
 
05:29:24.190 --> 05:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
activities and unsupervised visits
 
05:29:27.548 --> 05:29:27.558 align:start position:0%
including Christmas Day for8 hours this
 
05:29:30.430 --> 05:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
child had not seen this man in 6
 
05:29:32.830 --> 05:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
years the other judges that came after
 
05:29:34.230 --> 05:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
and that's the one thing every time you
 
05:29:36.470 --> 05:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
go to a hearing it's a different judge
 
05:29:38.590 --> 05:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
so you have to start over and you're
 
05:29:41.150 --> 05:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
revictimized you're wearing people out
 
05:29:43.750 --> 05:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars in law
 
05:29:45.510 --> 05:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
losing your home when I should be there
 
05:29:48.150 --> 05:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
for those boys and helping them as a mom
 
05:29:50.948 --> 05:29:50.958 align:start position:0%
as a Mimi no I'm pulled out of work to
 
05:29:53.510 --> 05:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
go to court every time I turn around
 
05:29:55.948 --> 05:29:55.958 align:start position:0%
that's not efficient these cases should
 
05:29:58.670 --> 05:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
be over and done with within a month but
 
05:30:00.470 --> 05:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
they drag on for years and hundreds of
 
05:30:02.548 --> 05:30:02.558 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars at the detriment of
 
05:30:04.070 --> 05:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
those parents being able to be healthy
 
05:30:06.750 --> 05:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
for those children but this judge he he
 
05:30:08.430 --> 05:30:08.440 align:start position:0%
ordered a parenting plan the judge I
 
05:30:10.310 --> 05:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
said is this a grandfather's visitation
 
05:30:12.070 --> 05:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
or is this a parenting plan because I'm
 
05:30:14.310 --> 05:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
not going to be the one to set a
 
05:30:16.910 --> 05:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
president and if I'm in contempt of
 
05:30:19.150 --> 05:30:19.160 align:start position:0%
court you can haul me off to jail but
 
05:30:22.190 --> 05:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not doing this we're not doing it
 
05:30:25.230 --> 05:30:25.240 align:start position:0%

05:30:28.190 --> 05:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
fasted and you know what happened out of
 
05:30:30.470 --> 05:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
nowhere this 10-year-old decided to
 
05:30:33.190 --> 05:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
confide in a school teacher with how he
 
05:30:36.670 --> 05:30:36.680 align:start position:0%
had been sexually assaulted by this
 
05:30:38.750 --> 05:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
grandfather we knew something had
 
05:30:40.830 --> 05:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
happened but he wasn't willing to talk
 
05:30:42.750 --> 05:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
about it when he was five and six years
 
05:30:46.070 --> 05:30:46.080 align:start position:0%

05:30:54.270 --> 05:30:54.280 align:start position:0%
dropped all of the requests through the
 
05:30:56.470 --> 05:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
family court that was our Saving Grace
 
05:30:57.990 --> 05:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
to protect that
 
05:31:00.868 --> 05:31:00.878 align:start position:0%

05:31:04.670 --> 05:31:04.680 align:start position:0%

of $512 in incentives that come from the

federal government back to the state so

board Robert tangue haven't seen my kid
 
05:33:59.788 --> 05:33:59.798 align:start position:0%
in over two years no arrests nothing
 
05:34:02.590 --> 05:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
some of you people have uh not even not
 
05:34:04.910 --> 05:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
even uh I guess except for the State
 
05:34:08.270 --> 05:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
trying to arrest me um and I've been
 
05:34:10.708 --> 05:34:10.718 align:start position:0%
before this General Court uh many times
 
05:34:12.628 --> 05:34:12.638 align:start position:0%
and also did the same tactic that the
 
05:34:15.510 --> 05:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
domestic violence Coalition so I I I
 
05:34:17.548 --> 05:34:17.558 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill and I ask that I get a
 
05:34:20.750 --> 05:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
couple extra minutes if not I do request
 
05:34:22.708 --> 05:34:22.718 align:start position:0%
that you guys do ask me questions
 
05:34:25.070 --> 05:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
because I'm a wealth of knowledge I I've
 
05:34:27.470 --> 05:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
read the family courts I've read all the
 
05:34:30.948 --> 05:34:30.958 align:start position:0%
statutes including 546a colon 5 which
 
05:34:34.270 --> 05:34:34.280 align:start position:0%
requires the judge to shall consider
 
05:34:38.350 --> 05:34:38.360 align:start position:0%
assets and determining child support
 
05:34:41.270 --> 05:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
the system that we have in New Hampshire
 
05:34:44.230 --> 05:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
this bill won't pass we need to
 
05:34:47.350 --> 05:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
repeal 173b which is domestic violence
 
05:34:49.070 --> 05:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
which is being used to
 
05:34:52.070 --> 05:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
weaponize at the benefit of lawyers and
 
05:34:54.708 --> 05:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
Federal grant money the courts
 
05:34:58.350 --> 05:34:58.360 align:start position:0%
fictitious domestic violence petitions I
 
05:35:00.470 --> 05:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
have also video that I uh that I can
 
05:35:02.030 --> 05:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
sent to you for the latest court hearing
 
05:35:04.190 --> 05:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
CU I record all the court hearings with
 
05:35:06.390 --> 05:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
permission uh where the
 
05:35:09.110 --> 05:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
judge after after having the defendant
 
05:35:12.350 --> 05:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
laugh uh said that the police
 
05:35:16.430 --> 05:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
tell people to go to court to get a
 
05:35:18.310 --> 05:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
restraining order so when you look at
 
05:35:21.868 --> 05:35:21.878 align:start position:0%
the hierarchy
 
05:35:25.390 --> 05:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
of uh evidence probable cause is what's
 
05:35:27.070 --> 05:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
required for a police officer to apply
 
05:35:29.350 --> 05:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
for a
 
05:35:32.150 --> 05:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
warrant uh preponderance of the evidence
 
05:35:34.190 --> 05:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
Which is higher standard is required for
 
05:35:36.670 --> 05:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
a domestic violence petition so what we
 
05:35:39.310 --> 05:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
have is really a backet of lawyers uh
 
05:35:41.868 --> 05:35:41.878 align:start position:0%
lawyers who are making money and
 
05:35:43.948 --> 05:35:43.958 align:start position:0%
advocating laws including the domestic
 
05:35:45.628 --> 05:35:45.638 align:start position:0%
violence Coalition which has spent over
 
05:35:49.830 --> 05:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
$10,000 last year in advocating for laws
 
05:35:54.310 --> 05:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
and it's all in uh public record
 
05:35:58.350 --> 05:35:58.360 align:start position:0%
so I know you guys can't rehear
 
05:36:01.788 --> 05:36:01.798 align:start position:0%
my case and we really have a problem
 
05:36:03.510 --> 05:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
with the Supreme Court so we're going to
 
05:36:06.868 --> 05:36:06.878 align:start position:0%
the people who are not able to help
 
05:36:10.230 --> 05:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
judges right lies that's why we need a
 
05:36:14.750 --> 05:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
jury we could just simply repeal this or
 
05:36:16.830 --> 05:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
uh repeal the family courts and then it
 
05:36:18.310 --> 05:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
would go back to the way it was before
 
05:36:20.390 --> 05:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have to do anything but I
 
05:36:22.310 --> 05:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
think we also need to repeal if we
 
05:36:24.230 --> 05:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
really want to get the change and people
 
05:36:26.350 --> 05:36:26.360 align:start position:0%
because these people haven't been heard
 
05:36:29.150 --> 05:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
I haven't been heard that's the problem
 
05:36:30.708 --> 05:36:30.718 align:start position:0%
and Mr tangu I think we're going to cut
 
05:36:33.548 --> 05:36:33.558 align:start position:0%
you off here because of time but are you
 
05:36:35.470 --> 05:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
said you would ask answer a couple
 
05:36:37.230 --> 05:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
questions I hope briefly does anybody
 
05:36:39.070 --> 05:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
have a couple of questions on
 
05:36:40.750 --> 05:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
suggestions I have to make the bill
 
05:36:43.150 --> 05:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
better might help you I will give you
 
05:36:44.670 --> 05:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
one more minute because you're one of my
 
05:36:48.948 --> 05:36:48.958 align:start position:0%
frequent flyers thank you sir okay so we
 
05:36:51.230 --> 05:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
need a jury mandatory that that is not a
 
05:36:54.070 --> 05:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
wable right unless it is told to someone
 
05:36:58.390 --> 05:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
so when we wave rights or wave
 
05:37:01.548 --> 05:37:01.558 align:start position:0%
rules uh that needs to be like you
 
05:37:03.150 --> 05:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
should be able allowed to object to it
 
05:37:05.590 --> 05:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
so we need a jury uh we need to repeal
 
05:37:08.310 --> 05:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
173b it's unconstitutional the police
 
05:37:10.190 --> 05:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
are supposed to make an arrest and then
 
05:37:13.390 --> 05:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
we also need to repeal uh judicial
 
05:37:14.628 --> 05:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
sovereign immunity which is
 
05:37:16.670 --> 05:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional anyways article 8 the
 
05:37:18.030 --> 05:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire you guys need to
 
05:37:21.510 --> 05:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:24.910 --> 05:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
constitutions and base laws upon this I
 
05:37:27.628 --> 05:37:27.638 align:start position:0%
suggest that this committee does go
 
05:37:30.510 --> 05:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
forward with this bill but examines it
 
05:37:33.230 --> 05:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
and maybe a subcommittee to finally
 
05:37:36.868 --> 05:37:36.878 align:start position:0%
resolve this issue in because it's it's
 
05:37:39.190 --> 05:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
hurting our children it's it's that

minutes thank you Mr chairman and
 
05:38:06.270 --> 05:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um Leah kushman
 
05:38:08.548 --> 05:38:08.558 align:start position:0%
where New Hampshire uh New Hampshire
 
05:38:08.558 --> 05:38:09.788 align:start position:0%
where New Hampshire uh New Hampshire
Family

05:38:09.788 --> 05:38:09.798 align:start position:0%
Family
 
05:38:12.190 --> 05:38:12.200 align:start position:0%
Justice if the legislature creates a
 
05:38:14.270 --> 05:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
court of law or a court of equity and
 
05:38:16.230 --> 05:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
then puts it into statute that the court
 
05:38:18.030 --> 05:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
is not bound by rules of equity or
 
05:38:20.310 --> 05:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
common law then the court is not a court
 
05:38:23.030 --> 05:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
of equity or a court of law then what
 
05:38:26.150 --> 05:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
kind of court is it it's like calling
 
05:38:28.070 --> 05:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
something a bathtub but it's convex and
 
05:38:28.948 --> 05:38:28.958 align:start position:0%
made of
 
05:38:31.270 --> 05:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
paper okay so what kind of court is it
 
05:38:32.830 --> 05:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
actually I think the ambiguity is part
 
05:38:35.708 --> 05:38:35.718 align:start position:0%
of the game um I think it's uh Works in
 
05:38:37.590 --> 05:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
favor of the system of the business
 
05:38:39.948 --> 05:38:39.958 align:start position:0%
model keeps people confused and not
 
05:38:41.548 --> 05:38:41.558 align:start position:0%
knowing how to resolve the issues that
 
05:38:43.670 --> 05:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
they see um if you don't know the rules
 
05:38:45.030 --> 05:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
you're at a disadvantage and the court
 
05:38:46.390 --> 05:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
has all the advantage for whatever
 
05:38:49.030 --> 05:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
outcome it wants if you want to come
 
05:38:51.150 --> 05:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
back if they want you to come back they
 
05:38:56.270 --> 05:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
create or um encourage more conflict uh
 
05:38:58.910 --> 05:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
they'll bring in outside parties um who
 
05:39:00.468 --> 05:39:00.478 align:start position:0%
also benefit from grant money that's
 
05:39:01.910 --> 05:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
flowing in from the federal government
 
05:39:04.150 --> 05:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
from these cases and they create
 
05:39:05.910 --> 05:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
conditions for your case to be
 
05:39:09.430 --> 05:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
protracted and here Li the rub when you
 
05:39:13.390 --> 05:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
are in this court um there is no due
 
05:39:15.788 --> 05:39:15.798 align:start position:0%
process and if there's no due
 
05:39:15.798 --> 05:39:17.468 align:start position:0%
process and if there's no due
process

05:39:17.468 --> 05:39:17.478 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:39:20.150 --> 05:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
um then there's you don't have Miranda
 
05:39:22.230 --> 05:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
rights right there's a preponderance of
 
05:39:25.350 --> 05:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
the evidence and if you're if there's a
 
05:39:29.350 --> 05:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
suspicion that someone is ACU is abusing
 
05:39:31.708 --> 05:39:31.718 align:start position:0%
a child then they've already
 
05:39:33.390 --> 05:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
incriminated themselves in family court
 
05:39:35.590 --> 05:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
and there's supposed to be immunity for
 
05:39:37.070 --> 05:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
things that go on in family court but we
 
05:39:39.390 --> 05:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
see that that's not applied so it's just
 
05:39:43.830 --> 05:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
more mixing up of proper process of law
 
05:39:46.390 --> 05:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
it just poisons the entire well in the
 
05:39:49.070 --> 05:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
ability to make sure that Justice is is
 
05:39:51.468 --> 05:39:51.478 align:start position:0%
had um and when they go to a court of
 
05:39:54.510 --> 05:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
law they can say you know my Miranda
 
05:39:56.230 --> 05:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
rights are violated and then you can't
 
05:39:59.270 --> 05:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
stick the charges on this person um so
 
05:40:01.070 --> 05:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
the question about the mediation about
 
05:40:02.910 --> 05:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
what the differen is current mediators
 
05:40:05.110 --> 05:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
are uh private
 
05:40:07.350 --> 05:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
contractors and this bill proposes a
 
05:40:10.030 --> 05:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
state budget funded certified family
 
05:40:13.230 --> 05:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
mediators they're employees of the state
 
05:40:16.030 --> 05:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
um so then there's no if it's funded
 
05:40:18.830 --> 05:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
just by the state budget and I say that
 
05:40:21.670 --> 05:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
for the entire court and the mediation
 
05:40:23.708 --> 05:40:23.718 align:start position:0%
that's being proposed then there's no
 
05:40:26.150 --> 05:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity for federal funds like we've
 
05:40:29.708 --> 05:40:29.718 align:start position:0%
seen with USA money and um you know
 
05:40:31.628 --> 05:40:31.638 align:start position:0%
other other Federal programs that are
 
05:40:33.830 --> 05:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
incentivizing and being abused with
 
05:40:36.548 --> 05:40:36.558 align:start position:0%
fraud all over the country it's just the
 
05:40:38.150 --> 05:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
same thing going with the family court
 
05:40:40.350 --> 05:40:40.360 align:start position:0%
here there's no possibility for that if
 
05:40:42.070 --> 05:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
you're just running the courts off of a
 
05:40:44.788 --> 05:40:44.798 align:start position:0%
state budget without Federal incentives
 
05:40:48.270 --> 05:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
that um you know drive drive people who
 
05:40:50.030 --> 05:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
are involved in the court to seek
 
05:40:53.590 --> 05:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
certain outcomes for financial gain so
 
05:40:55.548 --> 05:40:55.558 align:start position:0%
remove those incentives remove the
 
05:40:57.910 --> 05:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
ability for judges to use broad judicial
 
05:41:01.628 --> 05:41:01.638 align:start position:0%
discretion that's ant antithetical to um
 
05:41:03.430 --> 05:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
American Jurish Prudence anyway if you
 
05:41:05.350 --> 05:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
read maxims of law judicial discretion
 
05:41:09.230 --> 05:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be very limited
 
05:41:12.070 --> 05:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
um right now they already have to hire
 
05:41:14.230 --> 05:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
expensive lawyers and because cases are
 
05:41:17.190 --> 05:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
often protracted and because attorneys
 
05:41:19.430 --> 05:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
um 90% of litigation in New Hampshire is
 
05:41:22.230 --> 05:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
through Family Court um and because they
 
05:41:24.030 --> 05:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
know that the judges have broad judicial
 
05:41:26.390 --> 05:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
discretion the lawyers are often not
 
05:41:28.990 --> 05:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
willing to go to bat for their clients
 
05:41:31.230 --> 05:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
because it would be career
 
05:41:33.990 --> 05:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
suicide you get about 10 seconds they go
 
05:41:37.030 --> 05:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
through 3 69ine attorneys over the years
 
05:41:38.310 --> 05:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
what what's happening with Doge right
 
05:41:40.910 --> 05:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
now they're going to dig into these HHS
 
05:41:42.590 --> 05:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
programs and they're going to find the
 
05:41:45.150 --> 05:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
fraud and waste and abuse in the family
 
05:41:46.948 --> 05:41:46.958 align:start position:0%
court systems across the country it's
 
05:41:50.030 --> 05:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
being called to be um dissolved Across
 
05:41:52.030 --> 05:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
the Nation New Hampshire needs to get
 
05:41:55.510 --> 05:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
out of the way before this windfall hits
 
05:41:59.910 --> 05:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:04.628 --> 05:42:04.638 align:start position:0%
questions we have none thank you for
 
05:42:14.910 --> 05:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:17.310 --> 05:42:17.320 align:start position:0%
kraan good afternoon Mr chairman members
 
05:42:18.830 --> 05:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Aon krian
 
05:42:20.070 --> 05:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
I'm the general counsel for the court
 
05:42:23.270 --> 05:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
system including the Family Division um
 
05:42:25.750 --> 05:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative love I I to to check you
 
05:42:27.430 --> 05:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
by name I think you made an observation
 
05:42:29.150 --> 05:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
to me the other day that confidence in
 
05:42:31.110 --> 05:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
the Family Division was at an all-time
 
05:42:34.390 --> 05:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
low I'm I'm worried that that isn't true
 
05:42:37.310 --> 05:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh there's actually a long history that
 
05:42:39.670 --> 05:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
I completely understand in New Hampshire
 
05:42:42.868 --> 05:42:42.878 align:start position:0%
that we are are are cherish our freedom
 
05:42:44.468 --> 05:42:44.478 align:start position:0%
and bringing the matters of your
 
05:42:49.110 --> 05:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
personal life into court is so difficult
 
05:42:51.510 --> 05:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
um having the court make decisions about
 
05:42:52.910 --> 05:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
time with your children whether you'll
 
05:42:54.788 --> 05:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
continue to live in your house whether
 
05:42:56.150 --> 05:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
you will continue to be married to
 
05:42:57.510 --> 05:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
someone you maybe don't want to be
 
05:43:01.150 --> 05:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
divorced from is so difficult I think
 
05:43:02.468 --> 05:43:02.478 align:start position:0%
it's difficult everywhere but I think
 
05:43:04.708 --> 05:43:04.718 align:start position:0%
it's it's difficult for granite Staters
 
05:43:06.510 --> 05:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
um and there has been a long engagement
 
05:43:07.708 --> 05:43:07.718 align:start position:0%
between the legis legislature and
 
05:43:09.750 --> 05:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
between the Judiciary and a lot of
 
05:43:11.868 --> 05:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
different things have been tried um you
 
05:43:14.230 --> 05:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
know it was an experiment to move from
 
05:43:17.270 --> 05:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court to a dedicated Family
 
05:43:20.708 --> 05:43:20.718 align:start position:0%
Division um I do think we sometimes move
 
05:43:23.390 --> 05:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
in Trends um there was an idea that it
 
05:43:25.110 --> 05:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
would be better to have marital Masters
 
05:43:26.788 --> 05:43:26.798 align:start position:0%
because they would be extreme subject
 
05:43:28.430 --> 05:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
matter Specialists now they're
 
05:43:29.868 --> 05:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
disfavored there's only one marital
 
05:43:33.548 --> 05:43:33.558 align:start position:0%
Master left um so we do try different
 
05:43:36.310 --> 05:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
things um to create more confidence to
 
05:43:37.948 --> 05:43:37.958 align:start position:0%
create a better experience for
 
05:43:40.430 --> 05:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
constituents in the family court system
 
05:43:42.990 --> 05:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that that has changed the
 
05:43:46.390 --> 05:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
level of um public discomfort with
 
05:43:47.548 --> 05:43:47.558 align:start position:0%
bringing these very private and
 
05:43:50.788 --> 05:43:50.798 align:start position:0%
emotional matters into court um but we
 
05:43:51.910 --> 05:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
have tried different things and I
 
05:43:53.310 --> 05:43:53.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate that the legislature is
 
05:43:55.750 --> 05:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
always looking for those opportunities
 
05:43:57.750 --> 05:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
to improve if it's a 100 small
 
05:44:00.110 --> 05:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
improvements if it's one big one um what
 
05:44:01.750 --> 05:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
can improve people's experiences with
 
05:44:04.990 --> 05:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
the family court um but I do think there
 
05:44:06.350 --> 05:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
are some things that are maybe not
 
05:44:08.670 --> 05:44:08.680 align:start position:0%
correct um the family court is
 
05:44:11.110 --> 05:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
a duly constituted court with
 
05:44:12.868 --> 05:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
constitutional officers it is not an
 
05:44:15.230 --> 05:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
administrative agency the judges are
 
05:44:17.310 --> 05:44:17.320 align:start position:0%
Judges um under New Hampshire
 
05:44:20.190 --> 05:44:20.200 align:start position:0%
Constitution part 72a the legislature
 
05:44:22.990 --> 05:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
can establish courts uh it's it's noted
 
05:44:23.868 --> 05:44:23.878 align:start position:0%
that the Supreme Court is a
 
05:44:25.270 --> 05:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional Court meaning that it is
 
05:44:26.788 --> 05:44:26.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned and specifically created in
 
05:44:28.590 --> 05:44:28.600 align:start position:0%
our constitution same of the Superior
 
05:44:29.990 --> 05:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
Court the circuit court is a
 
05:44:31.390 --> 05:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
legislatively created court but that
 
05:44:33.750 --> 05:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it unconstitutional it
 
05:44:35.110 --> 05:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
simply means the legislature could
 
05:44:36.590 --> 05:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
change it by legislation without
 
05:44:38.230 --> 05:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
amending the the Constitution and you
 
05:44:40.510 --> 05:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
could do that if you wanted to return to
 
05:44:43.030 --> 05:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
a period that existed in the past and
 
05:44:47.390 --> 05:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
have Superior Court resume um this work
 
05:44:48.670 --> 05:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
you could certainly do that you don't
 
05:44:50.990 --> 05:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
need an amendment to the Constitution I
 
05:44:52.708 --> 05:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
think you may find that there is a wave
 
05:44:54.430 --> 05:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
again that there is concern that the
 
05:44:55.750 --> 05:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
Superior Court judges who are
 
05:44:58.190 --> 05:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
generalists may not be deep subject
 
05:45:00.548 --> 05:45:00.558 align:start position:0%
matter experts in family law as most
 
05:45:03.190 --> 05:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court judges are about 40% of
 
05:45:05.990 --> 05:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
their time is spent on family cases
 
05:45:09.030 --> 05:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
there are 20 thousand about cases
 
05:45:11.270 --> 05:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
brought in the Family Division every
 
05:45:14.430 --> 05:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
year um thousands of mediations under
 
05:45:16.590 --> 05:45:16.600 align:start position:0%
the office of mediation and arbitration
 
05:45:19.270 --> 05:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
including a small amount of paid for
 
05:45:22.590 --> 05:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
time no she gets unlimited time look
 
05:45:25.110 --> 05:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
beginning um our mediators are certified
 
05:45:27.510 --> 05:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
by oplc so they have the family
 
05:45:29.830 --> 05:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
certification um and this is very it is
 
05:45:31.030 --> 05:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
very successful a lot of people
 
05:45:33.030 --> 05:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to mediate it
 
05:45:34.628 --> 05:45:34.638 align:start position:0%
is included in the packet they get when
 
05:45:36.390 --> 05:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
they do a divorce imp parent in case
 
05:45:37.830 --> 05:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
that they have the option to do
 
05:45:40.390 --> 05:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
mediation um so we certainly believe in
 
05:45:42.150 --> 05:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
the court system in doing the best we
 
05:45:43.788 --> 05:45:43.798 align:start position:0%
can for people and we appreciate how
 
05:45:45.788 --> 05:45:45.798 align:start position:0%
much the legislature is looking at
 
05:45:48.628 --> 05:45:48.638 align:start position:0%
anything that can be better
 
05:45:51.830 --> 05:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
um I don't this will represent a return
 
05:45:53.070 --> 05:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
to a historical period that you could
 
05:45:55.150 --> 05:45:55.160 align:start position:0%
study and see if you prefer the results
 
05:45:57.670 --> 05:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
from that period um but it is up to you
 
05:45:58.910 --> 05:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
if you want to change things from the
 
05:46:00.750 --> 05:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court to the superior court and
 
05:46:02.548 --> 05:46:02.558 align:start position:0%
if you want to have uh two offices of
 
05:46:05.830 --> 05:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
mediation instead of one um but I'm I'm
 
05:46:06.910 --> 05:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
happy to answer your questions about
 
05:46:13.670 --> 05:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:16.150 --> 05:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
works yeah thank you representative
 
05:46:19.070 --> 05:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
Raymond we have an expert witness here
 
05:46:20.948 --> 05:46:20.958 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:46:25.190 --> 05:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so my question
 
05:46:25.200 --> 05:46:26.190 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so my question
is

05:46:26.190 --> 05:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:46:31.990 --> 05:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
about um judicial oversight or audits or
 
05:46:34.510 --> 05:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
you know visitations and observations in
 
05:46:36.628 --> 05:46:36.638 align:start position:0%
courtrooms because I'm hearing over and
 
05:46:39.310 --> 05:46:39.320 align:start position:0%
over again these really heart-rending
 
05:46:42.110 --> 05:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
stories about people who felt that they
 
05:46:44.990 --> 05:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
weren't heard weren't understood didn't
 
05:46:46.750 --> 05:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
understand what was happening or what's
 
05:46:47.990 --> 05:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
going on with their children and their
 
05:46:50.350 --> 05:46:50.360 align:start position:0%
families doesn't make sense to them or
 
05:46:51.990 --> 05:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
judges are acting in a way that doesn't
 
05:46:54.830 --> 05:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
make sense so is there currently or can
 
05:46:58.788 --> 05:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
we make a system where there is a like
 
05:47:00.150 --> 05:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
like I'm thinking about teachers
 
05:47:02.310 --> 05:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
teachers have the principal or the
 
05:47:04.150 --> 05:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
assistant principal comes in like five
 
05:47:06.070 --> 05:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
times a year and observes their
 
05:47:08.270 --> 05:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
classroom and then gives them coaching
 
05:47:10.948 --> 05:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
and pointers on how to how to do better
 
05:47:13.750 --> 05:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
is there a system like that for judges
 
05:47:16.070 --> 05:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
great question um I think typically if
 
05:47:18.150 --> 05:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
there is a complaint what you'd have is
 
05:47:19.350 --> 05:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
that the administrative judge of the
 
05:47:20.670 --> 05:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
relevant court so if it's Circuit Court
 
05:47:22.310 --> 05:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
it would be judge Christo maybe her
 
05:47:25.110 --> 05:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
Deputy judge Kissinger will review that
 
05:47:27.510 --> 05:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
specific audio and see if there is a
 
05:47:29.590 --> 05:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
teachable moment a problems that's the
 
05:47:32.230 --> 05:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
boss essentially of the Circuit Court um
 
05:47:33.628 --> 05:47:33.638 align:start position:0%
I think one of the things that has
 
05:47:35.230 --> 05:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
hampered Us in wanting to implement
 
05:47:36.830 --> 05:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
exactly what you've described which
 
05:47:38.750 --> 05:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
which is having very experienced retired
 
05:47:40.548 --> 05:47:40.558 align:start position:0%
judges for example sitting in with the
 
05:47:42.830 --> 05:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
newer judges is that we have needed to
 
05:47:45.868 --> 05:47:45.878 align:start position:0%
use a lot of those judges um because we
 
05:47:48.310 --> 05:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
have been Staffing up to full Staffing
 
05:47:50.350 --> 05:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
the legislature support in expanding uh
 
05:47:51.628 --> 05:47:51.638 align:start position:0%
circuit court judgeships has been so
 
05:47:53.990 --> 05:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
important we are now fully staffed at 49
 
05:47:56.628 --> 05:47:56.638 align:start position:0%
but a lot of those judges are new um so
 
05:47:58.510 --> 05:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
there is still a lot of shadowing of
 
05:48:00.150 --> 05:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
Judges there is still a lot of close
 
05:48:02.270 --> 05:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
watching and training of those judges
 
05:48:03.390 --> 05:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
when we can free up some of the more
 
05:48:04.590 --> 05:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
experienced judges I think that's
 
05:48:06.310 --> 05:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
exactly what the the Chief Justice wants
 
05:48:08.230 --> 05:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
to do is have our retired judges and our
 
05:48:10.070 --> 05:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
very experienced judges sitting in
 
05:48:11.510 --> 05:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
courtrooms watching the new judges and
 
05:48:13.830 --> 05:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
giving them direct
 
05:48:16.948 --> 05:48:16.958 align:start position:0%
feedback followup thank you Mr chairman
 
05:48:20.350 --> 05:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
so I guess the question is what what
 
05:48:22.628 --> 05:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
does the judicial branch need from the
 
05:48:25.270 --> 05:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
legislature or the budget or whatever to
 
05:48:28.110 --> 05:48:28.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're having this kind of
 
05:48:31.750 --> 05:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
ongoing routine oversight so that
 
05:48:33.990 --> 05:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
when when these so that these things
 
05:48:40.350 --> 05:48:40.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:42.788 --> 05:48:42.798 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure it's something that we we
 
05:48:44.430 --> 05:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
need I think we just need to start being
 
05:48:46.230 --> 05:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
able to pull these retired judges off of
 
05:48:49.270 --> 05:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
cases and and be dedicating them to that
 
05:48:51.230 --> 05:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
um and having the full Staffing of
 
05:48:52.548 --> 05:48:52.558 align:start position:0%
Judges which the legislature has already
 
05:48:55.468 --> 05:48:55.478 align:start position:0%
supported is really the biggest piece of
 
05:48:57.150 --> 05:48:57.160 align:start position:0%
that but I don't think there's a new
 
05:48:58.830 --> 05:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
resource or a legal enablement that we
 
05:49:01.708 --> 05:49:01.718 align:start position:0%
need it's just been freeing up
 
05:49:03.990 --> 05:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
resources representative
 
05:49:06.310 --> 05:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
Greg thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:49:08.350 --> 05:49:08.360 align:start position:0%
for being here and answering questions
 
05:49:10.788 --> 05:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
how um serious so we heard about like a
 
05:49:13.190 --> 05:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
pattern from some selected cases that
 
05:49:16.390 --> 05:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
they had but how um serious does the uh
 
05:49:18.548 --> 05:49:18.558 align:start position:0%
court system take complaints or how do
 
05:49:20.350 --> 05:49:20.360 align:start position:0%
you handle complaints if there's about a
 
05:49:22.788 --> 05:49:22.798 align:start position:0%
specific Judge or something like that
 
05:49:24.750 --> 05:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
there's there's a a dedicated email and
 
05:49:26.110 --> 05:49:26.120 align:start position:0%
I think I've sent it but I'm happy to
 
05:49:27.510 --> 05:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
send it which is for Circuit Court
 
05:49:29.310 --> 05:49:29.320 align:start position:0%
concerns and that takes in everything
 
05:49:30.150 --> 05:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
that's related to the work of the
 
05:49:31.548 --> 05:49:31.558 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court there are other patterns
 
05:49:33.310 --> 05:49:33.320 align:start position:0%
if if you have complaints about other
 
05:49:35.430 --> 05:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
interactions in the judicial branch and
 
05:49:37.150 --> 05:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
if it's about staff it will go through
 
05:49:38.788 --> 05:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
their managers if about Judges it'll go
 
05:49:40.030 --> 05:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
through the judicial management chain
 
05:49:42.270 --> 05:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
which is the deputy and and head
 
05:49:43.590 --> 05:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
administrative judge of the circuit
 
05:49:45.548 --> 05:49:45.558 align:start position:0%
court so if they see that someone
 
05:49:47.948 --> 05:49:47.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to it has had some type of
 
05:49:49.628 --> 05:49:49.638 align:start position:0%
issue they maybe misapplied the law they
 
05:49:51.110 --> 05:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
might arrange more training they might
 
05:49:53.110 --> 05:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
do something like that so it's it's
 
05:49:54.548 --> 05:49:54.558 align:start position:0%
typically through direct contact with
 
05:49:56.430 --> 05:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court concerns and they they
 
05:49:59.030 --> 05:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
see complaints
 
05:50:03.030 --> 05:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:07.590 --> 05:50:07.600 align:start position:0%

question

05:50:12.788 --> 05:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:50:16.070 --> 05:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
no go ahead uh reg regarding the
 
05:50:17.830 --> 05:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
statement about the confidence in the in
 
05:50:20.670 --> 05:50:20.680 align:start position:0%

testimony after testimony and nobody's
 
05:50:28.990 --> 05:50:29.000 align:start position:0%

05:50:31.150 --> 05:50:31.160 align:start position:0%
family court system I'll stick by my
 
05:50:33.830 --> 05:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
statement saying it's a complete failure
 
05:50:35.350 --> 05:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
and I and I think that what I was
 
05:50:37.110 --> 05:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
meaning to say is that that concern has
 
05:50:38.990 --> 05:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
been around for a while I don't think
 
05:50:40.230 --> 05:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
that your concern about the present
 
05:50:42.030 --> 05:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
state is wrong I think that that's
 
05:50:44.750 --> 05:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
that's a running issue um that that we
 
05:50:46.708 --> 05:50:46.718 align:start position:0%
have folks that just are not H that are
 
05:50:47.910 --> 05:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
not comfortable with the experience that
 
05:50:49.230 --> 05:50:49.240 align:start position:0%
they had in circuit court that that is a
 
05:50:51.830 --> 05:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
long running issue um so I'm certainly
 
05:50:53.510 --> 05:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
not saying that that's not the state
 
05:50:57.670 --> 05:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:59.708 --> 05:50:59.718 align:start position:0%
while I don't know
 
05:51:04.030 --> 05:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
how many of the sessions of the special
 
05:51:08.150 --> 05:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
committee you sat in on I sat in on them
 
05:51:11.830 --> 05:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
all and I heard from equally angry
 
05:51:14.070 --> 05:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
people of the same gender I say that to
 
05:51:17.948 --> 05:51:17.958 align:start position:0%
remove the gender cross issue that the
 
05:51:20.070 --> 05:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
other one just wanted to stretch the
 
05:51:23.150 --> 05:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
thing out by more motions by more
 
05:51:27.468 --> 05:51:27.478 align:start position:0%
motions and the same room full of people
 
05:51:29.468 --> 05:51:29.478 align:start position:0%
half of them would say they won't let me
 
05:51:31.030 --> 05:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
bring things up they're rushing to
 
05:51:34.310 --> 05:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
judgment okay who's right would you
 
05:51:37.468 --> 05:51:37.478 align:start position:0%
believe that there were numbers of
 
05:51:40.990 --> 05:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
people who said I want the rule to
 
05:51:44.548 --> 05:51:44.558 align:start position:0%
change so whatever I bring in as a piece
 
05:51:46.990 --> 05:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
of evidence will be admitted no you
 
05:51:50.150 --> 05:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
don't because other people said that
 
05:51:52.628 --> 05:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
judge allowed my acts to come in and
 
05:51:55.310 --> 05:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
talk about something that I did wrong 30
 
05:51:57.830 --> 05:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
years ago and it has no probative value
 
05:52:01.190 --> 05:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
which is it some of this is I'd hate to
 
05:52:03.468 --> 05:52:03.478 align:start position:0%
be a family court judge trying to be
 
05:52:06.270 --> 05:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
fair when you've got equally angry
 
05:52:08.310 --> 05:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
people people who feel like they have
 
05:52:11.310 --> 05:52:11.320 align:start position:0%
been dumped on by a I can't give all the
 
05:52:13.948 --> 05:52:13.958 align:start position:0%
beautiful adjectives of the journalist
 
05:52:17.430 --> 05:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
system and they mutually exclude each
 
05:52:20.590 --> 05:52:20.600 align:start position:0%
other I it's very hard for a family
 
05:52:22.070 --> 05:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
judge but I think it's hard for the
 
05:52:23.990 --> 05:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
legislature I see that our legislature
 
05:52:25.190 --> 05:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
was very close to the people and
 
05:52:27.510 --> 05:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
attempts to be very responsive and and
 
05:52:31.150 --> 05:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
that is why is always changing there is
 
05:52:33.110 --> 05:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
there is more revision of the law in the
 
05:52:34.708 --> 05:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
area of family law than probably any
 
05:52:36.548 --> 05:52:36.558 align:start position:0%
other area that affects the court system
 
05:52:39.310 --> 05:52:39.320 align:start position:0%
every year um and you you may hear that
 
05:52:41.628 --> 05:52:41.638 align:start position:0%
some people are saying I don't like that
 
05:52:42.830 --> 05:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
the parenting was equal and some people
 
05:52:44.510 --> 05:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
are saying the parenting must be equal
 
05:52:47.350 --> 05:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
and the legislature is always trying to
 
05:52:49.468 --> 05:52:49.478 align:start position:0%
learn from those cases and always trying
 
05:52:53.948 --> 05:52:53.958 align:start position:0%
to find um a sweet spot but I think you
 
05:52:55.590 --> 05:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
it is a tremendous Challenge and what
 
05:52:58.190 --> 05:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
happens is the Law changes a lot in this
 
05:52:59.910 --> 05:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
area and the judges are always training
 
05:53:01.750 --> 05:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
and always learning and always trying to
 
05:53:06.468 --> 05:53:06.478 align:start position:0%
hit that moving Target um but in reality
 
05:53:08.030 --> 05:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
people are distressed by very different
 
05:53:09.868 --> 05:53:09.878 align:start position:0%
and very oppositional things they either
 
05:53:11.430 --> 05:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
want an automatic presumption that
 
05:53:12.990 --> 05:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
everything is equal or they do not want
 
05:53:14.468 --> 05:53:14.478 align:start position:0%
to share parenting with the other parent
 
05:53:15.510 --> 05:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
or have that parenting time
 
05:53:17.350 --> 05:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
significantly reduced they want to be
 
05:53:18.708 --> 05:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
able to introduce whatever they want or
 
05:53:19.910 --> 05:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
they don't want the other side to be
 
05:53:22.030 --> 05:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
able to introduce certain things it is
 
05:53:24.110 --> 05:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
very difficult legislatively to
 
05:53:26.670 --> 05:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
accommodate these concerns in a cohesive
 
05:53:29.390 --> 05:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
way which is why I think we do go to
 
05:53:30.830 --> 05:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
Superior Court and then to Family
 
05:53:32.628 --> 05:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
Division and maybe back to Super again
 
05:53:34.030 --> 05:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
go to Specialists and then to
 
05:53:35.948 --> 05:53:35.958 align:start position:0%
generalists and change change the law
 
05:53:37.510 --> 05:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's tremendously difficult to
 
05:53:39.070 --> 05:53:39.080 align:start position:0%
address all the different kinds of
 
05:53:41.468 --> 05:53:41.478 align:start position:0%
concerns that people raise it was my
 
05:53:43.510 --> 05:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
experience chairing that special
 
05:53:46.708 --> 05:53:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:49.510 --> 05:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
Judiciary really wanted to fix things
 
05:53:51.708 --> 05:53:51.718 align:start position:0%
and we went as you remember we went for
 
05:53:54.510 --> 05:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
the relatively easy ones but you know
 
05:53:57.590 --> 05:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
what if you show up at a family court
 
05:54:00.468 --> 05:54:00.478 align:start position:0%
and you just don't know what to do and
 
05:54:03.110 --> 05:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
now somebody's helping you that may be a
 
05:54:05.708 --> 05:54:05.718 align:start position:0%
minor thing but not to you it is it's a
 
05:54:08.270 --> 05:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
good thing for for you and I I just
 
05:54:11.430 --> 05:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
think of um my colleague over here she'd
 
05:54:13.830 --> 05:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
show up at a hearing to try to convince
 
05:54:15.750 --> 05:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
some of you people to do something and
 
05:54:18.590 --> 05:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
you had been listening in on our
 
05:54:20.150 --> 05:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
sessions and you were already in the
 
05:54:22.430 --> 05:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
process of doing it you know I I think
 
05:54:25.590 --> 05:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
you've got the magic touch on
 
05:54:28.670 --> 05:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
this yeah and I think the Judiciary was
 
05:54:31.990 --> 05:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
quite open now when we crank up the next
 
05:54:35.190 --> 05:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
round of this we've heard testimony I'll
 
05:54:37.390 --> 05:54:37.400 align:start position:0%
be picking five or six people to serve
 
05:54:40.310 --> 05:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
with me on this subcommittee which will
 
05:54:43.548 --> 05:54:43.558 align:start position:0%
last two years or a year and a half and
 
05:54:45.150 --> 05:54:45.160 align:start position:0%
we'll go for some of the things that
 
05:54:47.110 --> 05:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
we've heard today to see if we can catch
 
05:54:49.430 --> 05:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
them by the tail maybe we can't but I
 
05:54:50.708 --> 05:54:50.718 align:start position:0%
don't think we're going to make it worse
 
05:54:53.468 --> 05:54:53.478 align:start position:0%
I think we have some things that we are
 
05:54:56.070 --> 05:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
chewing on and I hope we all will do
 
05:54:58.310 --> 05:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
this and it may scare the Willies out of
 
05:55:00.070 --> 05:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
some of you and you will not volunteer
 
05:55:02.350 --> 05:55:02.360 align:start position:0%
you'll run away very fast but I think
 
05:55:04.468 --> 05:55:04.478 align:start position:0%
some of you I think I'll have a a
 
05:55:06.468 --> 05:55:06.478 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that can take it the the
 
05:55:08.590 --> 05:55:08.600 align:start position:0%
next step and I know the Judiciary will
 
05:55:11.788 --> 05:55:11.798 align:start position:0%
be uh open to that the the people who
 
05:55:13.270 --> 05:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
work in the judicial branch want to
 
05:55:14.948 --> 05:55:14.958 align:start position:0%
serve the public they have chosen
 
05:55:17.150 --> 05:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
careers in public service and to be
 
05:55:18.788 --> 05:55:18.798 align:start position:0%
honest I don't know anybody wants to
 
05:55:20.350 --> 05:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
work in family law in the judicial
 
05:55:23.990 --> 05:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
branch it is tremendously difficult uh
 
05:55:25.548 --> 05:55:25.558 align:start position:0%
it is the area in which you face the
 
05:55:27.590 --> 05:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
most abuse from your litigant it is the
 
05:55:29.948 --> 05:55:29.958 align:start position:0%
area in which you are sued the most it
 
05:55:31.708 --> 05:55:31.718 align:start position:0%
is the area in which you are threatened
 
05:55:35.190 --> 05:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
and assaulted the most um in which you
 
05:55:37.270 --> 05:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
are accused of committing crimes in
 
05:55:39.110 --> 05:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
which you are routinely reported to the
 
05:55:41.030 --> 05:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
police for doing your job and not
 
05:55:43.910 --> 05:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
violating the law um I I really don't
 
05:55:45.948 --> 05:55:45.958 align:start position:0%
know um when you could be a judge and do
 
05:55:47.590 --> 05:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
anything if you wanted to you could be
 
05:55:48.750 --> 05:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
doing the probate cases you could be
 
05:55:49.948 --> 05:55:49.958 align:start position:0%
doing the criminal cases where you just
 
05:55:53.150 --> 05:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
do not face this level of abuse um I
 
05:55:55.708 --> 05:55:55.718 align:start position:0%
really don't know it makes me think of
 
05:55:57.708 --> 05:55:57.718 align:start position:0%
um being a police officer a few years
 
05:55:59.030 --> 05:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
ago I thought nothing would shake a
 
05:56:01.310 --> 05:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
person's calling to be a police officer
 
05:56:02.948 --> 05:56:02.958 align:start position:0%
and it got to be too much and a lot of
 
05:56:04.070 --> 05:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
people decided they didn't want to be
 
05:56:05.510 --> 05:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
police officers anymore no one would
 
05:56:07.070 --> 05:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
threaten to kill you he became a
 
05:56:08.990 --> 05:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
firefighter um and now we have a
 
05:56:11.510 --> 05:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
commission studying how we get people to
 
05:56:13.990 --> 05:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
be police officers again um you know I
 
05:56:15.750 --> 05:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
have worried I've seen people quit
 
05:56:17.788 --> 05:56:17.798 align:start position:0%
because they can't take the level of
 
05:56:19.510 --> 05:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
vitriol that's developed toward them
 
05:56:21.390 --> 05:56:21.400 align:start position:0%
they they've taken a job as a clerk
 
05:56:22.430 --> 05:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
because they want to do something that
 
05:56:23.750 --> 05:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
matches their kids school schedule they
 
05:56:25.070 --> 05:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
want to be a public servant they did not
 
05:56:26.910 --> 05:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
sign up to be threatened every single
 
05:56:29.750 --> 05:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
day by someone um so that is something
 
05:56:29.760 --> 05:56:33.030 align:start position:0%
day by someone um so that is something
that

05:56:33.030 --> 05:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:33.040 --> 05:56:34.830 align:start position:0%
 
I

05:56:34.830 --> 05:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:56:38.628 --> 05:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
quiet um so it's a it's a challenging
 
05:56:40.708 --> 05:56:40.718 align:start position:0%
job it's a challenging job to
 
05:56:40.718 --> 05:56:42.270 align:start position:0%
job it's a challenging job to
do

05:56:42.270 --> 05:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:56:46.310 --> 05:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
yeah well good thank
 
05:56:48.948 --> 05:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
you I do have another card it may be
 
05:56:51.270 --> 05:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
anticlimactic do you want to testify bu
 
05:56:51.280 --> 05:56:51.948 align:start position:0%
anticlimactic do you want to testify bu
or

05:56:51.948 --> 05:56:51.958 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:56:57.110 --> 05:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:04.070 --> 05:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:07.110 --> 05:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you Betty G from
 
05:57:10.350 --> 05:57:10.360 align:start position:0%
Salem um I've made several points
 
05:57:13.868 --> 05:57:13.878 align:start position:0%
they're not in a particular sequence but
 
05:57:15.310 --> 05:57:15.320 align:start position:0%
as I've listened to really good
 
05:57:17.468 --> 05:57:17.478 align:start position:0%
testimony all afternoon I thought I
 
05:57:20.150 --> 05:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
would just try to boil down the the
 
05:57:22.990 --> 05:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
important points that have come up the
 
05:57:26.468 --> 05:57:26.478 align:start position:0%
worst punishment is dealt with in Family
 
05:57:28.590 --> 05:57:28.600 align:start position:0%
Court of all the courts cuz losing your
 
05:57:31.270 --> 05:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
kids has to be the worst possible
 
05:57:33.468 --> 05:57:33.478 align:start position:0%
punishment right now we've established
 
05:57:37.150 --> 05:57:37.160 align:start position:0%
that in Family Court we do not follow
 
05:57:40.750 --> 05:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
process and although we're getting $5
 
05:57:44.390 --> 05:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
for every dollar we're not keeping all
 
05:57:46.788 --> 05:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
that because we're losing judgments in
 
05:57:51.430 --> 05:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:55.430 --> 05:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
process we we don't follow the rules of
 
05:57:58.430 --> 05:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
evidence but in Family Court current
 
05:58:01.830 --> 05:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
rules the judge can say we're not doing
 
05:58:05.590 --> 05:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
an evidentiary hearing at all with no
 
05:58:05.600 --> 05:58:06.910 align:start position:0%
an evidentiary hearing at all with no
excuse

05:58:06.910 --> 05:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
excuse
 
05:58:06.920 --> 05:58:07.868 align:start position:0%
excuse
that's

05:58:07.868 --> 05:58:07.878 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:58:13.590 --> 05:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:17.468 --> 05:58:17.478 align:start position:0%
idea yes we have mediators who work
 
05:58:20.830 --> 05:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
currently for Family Court they are not
 
05:58:23.670 --> 05:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
certified by the highest standards they
 
05:58:26.230 --> 05:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
can hang a shingle but they're not the
 
05:58:29.788 --> 05:58:29.798 align:start position:0%
kind of certified mediator that is being
 
05:58:32.948 --> 05:58:32.958 align:start position:0%
proposed in this
 
05:58:35.548 --> 05:58:35.558 align:start position:0%
bill we know there's a financial
 
05:58:35.558 --> 05:58:36.788 align:start position:0%
bill we know there's a financial
incentive

05:58:36.788 --> 05:58:36.798 align:start position:0%
incentive
 
05:58:39.030 --> 05:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
to maintain the status
 
05:58:42.628 --> 05:58:42.638 align:start position:0%
quo there a financial incentive for the
 
05:58:47.070 --> 05:58:47.080 align:start position:0%
budget because of twisting the rules
 
05:58:49.310 --> 05:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
05:58:52.948 --> 05:58:52.958 align:start position:0%
Congress Federal money is padding us but
 
05:58:55.270 --> 05:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
we're not really getting it
 
05:58:57.670 --> 05:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
fairly but they're not watching either
 
05:59:00.110 --> 05:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
so we're getting away with
 
05:59:02.628 --> 05:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
it in New Hampshire one of the things
 
05:59:04.390 --> 05:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
that makes it really difficult for
 
05:59:08.310 --> 05:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
people now this isn't family court but
 
05:59:12.270 --> 05:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire unlike some states if
 
05:59:16.350 --> 05:59:16.360 align:start position:0%
you're not can't afford an attorney only
 
05:59:19.270 --> 05:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
you can defend yourself in court only
 
05:59:22.430 --> 05:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
you can represent yourself but in some
 
05:59:25.830 --> 05:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
states they allow you to get assistance
 
05:59:28.350 --> 05:59:28.360 align:start position:0%
from someone else who may not be an
 
05:59:30.110 --> 05:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
attorney but there are at least two
 
05:59:33.070 --> 05:59:33.080 align:start position:0%
people behind me who had to teach
 
05:59:35.390 --> 05:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
themselves the law because you usually
 
05:59:38.030 --> 05:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
run out of money most people don't have
 
05:59:41.548 --> 05:59:41.558 align:start position:0%
the incomes of attorney to pay attorneys
 
05:59:44.510 --> 05:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
for very many hours so they have to
 
05:59:47.590 --> 05:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
teach themselves but most people aren't
 
05:59:50.948 --> 05:59:50.958 align:start position:0%
that good at teaching themselves but
 
05:59:53.230 --> 05:59:53.240 align:start position:0%
some people thank goodness are and
 
05:59:55.310 --> 05:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
they've been helping other people but
 
05:59:57.070 --> 05:59:57.080 align:start position:0%
they can't go to court and represent
 
06:00:01.230 --> 06:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
them our solution is all the good people
 
06:00:03.788 --> 06:00:03.798 align:start position:0%
that we have in the current the current
 
06:00:07.310 --> 06:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
family court system they can still work
 
06:00:12.390 --> 06:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
in a newly created court it's just that
 
06:00:15.670 --> 06:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
they have to start following the rules
 
06:00:20.468 --> 06:00:20.478 align:start position:0%
of of due process it's only fair as
 
06:00:22.788 --> 06:00:22.798 align:start position:0%
citizens of the United States we are
 
06:00:26.190 --> 06:00:26.200 align:start position:0%
entitled to courts that follow the
 
06:00:30.590 --> 06:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
law thank you that was a very wonderful
 
06:00:33.628 --> 06:00:33.638 align:start position:0%
summation of one side of the argument we
 
06:00:36.910 --> 06:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
heard today and uh you did sum it up
 
06:00:38.670 --> 06:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
very nicely I'm glad you put another
 
06:00:42.430 --> 06:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
pink card in um so your suggestion is
 
06:00:46.190 --> 06:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
you might recommend through a Court rule
 
06:00:49.708 --> 06:00:49.718 align:start position:0%
or through legislation that in family
 
06:00:52.788 --> 06:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
courts a prosay litigant might have the
 
06:00:55.990 --> 06:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
assistance of a helper of his or her
 
06:00:58.350 --> 06:00:58.360 align:start position:0%
choosing yes and I understand that in
 
06:01:01.030 --> 06:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
some cases in some states that is the
 
06:01:03.628 --> 06:01:03.638 align:start position:0%
law in fact the person who said it to me
 
06:01:05.510 --> 06:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
and I didn't get to check it out swore
 
06:01:07.190 --> 06:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
we were the only state that doesn't
 
06:01:07.200 --> 06:01:08.270 align:start position:0%
we were the only state that doesn't
allow

06:01:08.270 --> 06:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
allow
 
06:01:11.030 --> 06:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
it New Hampshire's always first or last
 
06:01:14.110 --> 06:01:14.120 align:start position:0%
you know that yeah any questions for rep
 
06:01:15.910 --> 06:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
former representative
 
06:01:18.628 --> 06:01:18.638 align:start position:0%
gay seeing
 
06:01:23.270 --> 06:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
none this ends it this concludes the um
 
06:01:26.468 --> 06:01:26.478 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 652 we will
 
06:01:32.150 --> 06:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
execute on the first Tuesday of March
 
06:01:36.270 --> 06:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
now we have additional copies of the
 
06:01:39.230 --> 06:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment to House Bill 10 the
 
06:01:41.150 --> 06:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
only difference from what I handed you
 
06:01:43.548 --> 06:01:43.558 align:start position:0%
last time is it actually has all three
 
06:01:46.110 --> 06:01:46.120 align:start position:0%
of the amendment writers on the top
 
06:01:49.270 --> 06:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
where the other one didn't and um the
 
06:01:52.750 --> 06:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
vice chairman has gotten a pile of these
 
06:01:54.628 --> 06:01:54.638 align:start position:0%
because we're getting people who are
 
06:01:58.548 --> 06:01:58.558 align:start position:0%
saying I don't like hb10 because it says
 
06:02:01.990 --> 06:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
says says or it doesn't say say say and
 
06:02:04.670 --> 06:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
maybe just maybe the amendment actually
 
06:02:07.948 --> 06:02:07.958 align:start position:0%
has taken that into account so if you've
 
06:02:10.628 --> 06:02:10.638 align:start position:0%
got people who are talking about
 
06:02:13.430 --> 06:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
hb10 you may want to have one or two of
 
06:02:17.030 --> 06:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
these to photocopy and hand to them um
 
06:02:19.390 --> 06:02:19.400 align:start position:0%
it's sometimes the case you don't see
 
06:02:22.830 --> 06:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment until the exact session I
 
06:02:24.948 --> 06:02:24.958 align:start position:0%
have decided I want it out there as wide
 
06:02:28.708 --> 06:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
as it can be so take them if you want
 
06:02:34.830 --> 06:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:34.840 --> 06:03:04.750 align:start position:0%
 
you

06:03:04.750 --> 06:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:04.760 --> 06:03:34.708 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:03:34.708 --> 06:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:34.718 --> 06:04:04.708 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:04:04.708 --> 06:04:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:04.718 --> 06:04:34.628 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:04:34.628 --> 06:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
