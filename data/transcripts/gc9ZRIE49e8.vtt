agenda Madam chair yes uh nothing to be
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
removed but I just wanted to make a
 
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
comment on two of the items um so the
 
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
first item is 2023 1220 the board of
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
psychologist conditional approval
 
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
request um and then the one that follows
 
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh rule 2023 143 the conditional
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
approval request for the Board of
 
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.069 align:start position:0%
approval request for the Board of
Professional

00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
Professional
 
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
geologists uh my concern in reading
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
through the materials um was the
 
00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519 align:start position:0%
reminder that we had lengthy discussions
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
and several meetings but I I believe as
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
far back as July about the fees related
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
to these um requests and the possible
 
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
need for future legislation or
 
00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
additional oplc rul making and um
 
00:13:01.389 --> 00:13:01.399 align:start position:0%
because I know we spent a considerable
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
amount of time discussing those two um
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
issues in length I I think it's just
 
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
worthy of noting again for the record
 
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
that um this is an ongoing matter and
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
that the committee is familiar with
 
00:13:17.189 --> 00:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
those discussions before we pass them
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like to mention that um I
 
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
at least have submitted
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
legislation U clarifying the fee issue I
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
believe there may be others because
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
there's a whole lot of other bills
 
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
addressing oplc uh we haven't seen the
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
words yet but uh we they will be
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
considered when they get this
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
year anyone
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%

represent I thought that was for the
 
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:05.320 align:start position:0%

00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%

those in favor I
 
00:14:32.199 --> 00:14:34.110 align:start position:0%
those in favor I
opposed

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:34.120 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:14:36.189 --> 00:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
okay now the
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
pediatrist okay so Board of Podiatry um
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
initial applications education
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
requirements and
 
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
fees this item was postponed from the
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
last meeting and an amended conditional
 
00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:50.959 align:start position:0%
approval request has been filed to
 
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
update the rule to say um oplc rather
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
than board um as the authority to
 
00:14:59.790 --> 00:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
process the licensing applications I
 
00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
believe this was a request of
 
00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
Representative groda so the um the
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
proposal has been amended to address
 
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
that they've also addressed uh some of
 
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
the other comments that were made um at
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
the last meeting the committee wanted
 
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
more information on the collection of
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
fees while the rules have been expired
 
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
and so the board is supposed to have
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
that information today um a lot of the
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
rules have been expired since April of
 
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
2019 and the statute doesn't establish
 
00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
the fees rather they're supposed to be
 
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
set up in rule if you recall the um the
 
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:35.240 align:start position:0%
PLC rules with the fees were just
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
recently adopted in July so there is
 
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
that time period from April of 2019 to
 
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
July of this year um in which you know
 
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
they may have collected some fees in
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
violation of 541
 
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
a22 which says that no expired rule can
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
be enforced for any purpose um anyway
 
00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
that's the only issue really that
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
remains in The Proposal and like I said
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
the board is I'm supposed to be able to
 
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
speak to that today good
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
morning good morning Tina Kelly from the
 
00:16:08.749 --> 00:16:08.759 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
certification with regards to the
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
expired rules um to the extent they
 
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
would be enforced would would have been
 
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
through the rsas um 315 27 and8
 
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:23.720 align:start position:0%
specifically for parts of those um there
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
were no disciplinary actions I look back
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
in that nothing no disciplinary action
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
was Tak on any expired rule with regards
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:36.839 align:start position:0%
fees um the fees were in statute until
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
71 of
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
2022 so the um the question is whether
 
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
or not fees were charged by 7even
 
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
between 71 of 22 and 81 of 23 and they
 
00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.829 align:start position:0%
between 71 of 22 and 81 of 23 and they
were

00:16:50.829 --> 00:16:50.839 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
not I could I take it the board of
 
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240 align:start position:0%

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:17.630 align:start position:0%
 
convenient

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:04.280 align:start position:0%

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
the forms were also uh filed this week
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
um but there are still uh some
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
legislative in comments to
 
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
review the first one is going to be on
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
page five of the conditional approval
 
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
request packet which is um page one of
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
the rule text there's a comment there
 
00:18:59.549 --> 00:18:59.559 align:start position:0%
because the rule rule allows for the
 
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
lure of lnas by comparable
 
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
education but that's not a category of
 
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
lure under the statute the statute um
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
talks about some other categories of
 
00:19:15.149 --> 00:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
lure but doesn't mentioned um by
 
00:19:15.159 --> 00:19:16.470 align:start position:0%
lure but doesn't mentioned um by
comparable

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
comparable
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
education so um in additionally it so it
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
looks like we're not really sure but it
 
00:19:24.149 --> 00:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
looks like there isn't a category for
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
that in the statute one and then
 
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
secondly I'm not seeing anything the
 
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
rules that really outline what criteria
 
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
the board will use to make that
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
determination what comparable education
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
means the rule does have you know
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
requirements for documentation that has
 
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
to be submit submitted and and stuff
 
00:19:48.029 --> 00:19:48.039 align:start position:0%
like that to substantively show that
 
00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
there was some education but as far as
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
whether or not you know how that meets
 
00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
you know approval how that is good
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
enough doesn't appear to be outlined in
 
00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:00.919 align:start position:0%
the rule um the other comment is or
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
actually there you're going to see
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the proposal well let's
 
00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:05.799 align:start position:0%
settle this issue first if you don't
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
mind sure M
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
re good morning again good morning Tina
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
Kelly with the office of professional
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
liur and
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
certification so as far as the
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
comparable education goes under RSA 326
 
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
under their rulemaking
 
00:20:23.909 --> 00:20:23.919 align:start position:0%
Authority um ran numeral I it says
 
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements for in for
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
issuance of initial license
 
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
um although it doesn't state it
 
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
specifically um
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
it's it it does provide the authority to
 
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
set those those
 
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
rules and as far as the
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
um uh I have a question on that why why
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
comparable what is comparable to you
 
00:20:51.549 --> 00:20:51.559 align:start position:0%
already have alternate education
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
shouldn't this be something more like
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
necessary education or appropriate
 
00:20:59.310 --> 00:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
education or something like that that it
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
would be comparable to what is already
 
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
in the rules because um there have been
 
00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
instances where somebody from the past
 
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
has gotten the fund the core core hold
 
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
on let me find it the um fundamentals
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
course work and although it's not called
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
that so it's it's comparable to what the
 
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
board requires so it would be the same
 
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
thing only it may be called something
 
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
different and we can't because this this
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
application form looking at it
 
00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:33.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't um they are required to to have
 
00:21:33.559 --> 00:21:35.070 align:start position:0%
doesn't um they are required to to have
the

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
examination or have the examination or
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
education one or the
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.039 --> 00:21:58.950 align:start position:0%
 
correctly

00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:22:00.909 --> 00:22:00.919 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I'm going to have to
 
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
look at that more yeah because if
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
looking further down the page it says an
 
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
applicant by comparable education shall
 
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
submit the transcripts okay that's fine
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
by alternate
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
experience which
 
00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
seems not listed as one other
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
criteria what do you mean alternate
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
experience yeah down on page three sub
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
paragraph F yeah seeking lur an LNA by
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
alternate experience shall in addition
 
00:22:39.789 --> 00:22:39.799 align:start position:0%
to to B which is the
 
00:22:39.799 --> 00:22:41.310 align:start position:0%
to to B which is the
um

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:48.919 align:start position:0%
application let
 
00:22:51.789 --> 00:22:51.799 align:start position:0%
see yeah if I could just jump in yeah I
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
mean the statute talks about licensure
 
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
by endorsement and then by examination
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
and then by alternate experience
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
experience those seem to be the three
 
00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
categories and and in my conversation
 
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
with Mike we just you know we made this
 
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
comment because it seemed like that you
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
know it didn't fall into one of those
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
three categories the alternate education
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't fall into one of those
 
00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:14.919 align:start position:0%
categories either right it should be
 
00:23:14.919 --> 00:23:16.190 align:start position:0%
categories either right it should be
alternate

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
alternate
 
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:19.240 align:start position:0%
experience right did I say educate sorry
 
00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
alternate experience is one of the
 
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
categories so it's endorsement
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
examination and then alternate
 
00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
experience so just not sure where where
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
this where comparable falls into those
 
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
three it looks like it doesn't I'm not
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
sure where alternate education Falls
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
either so it I mean I don't have any
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
doubts about the lnas but this this rule
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
sense pretty opaque
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
anyway it's pretty opaque anyway thank
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
sh Madame chair if we were to use use
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
language that we have we already that
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
already exists in statute that we it
 
00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:06.039 align:start position:0%
would be more comparable I mean I it
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
would make more sense so I think
 
00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
consistency in language
 
00:24:14.269 --> 00:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
throughout the statutes
 
00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
for um what we're talking about when
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.390 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
comparing

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
comparing
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
um experiences or education I think we
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
have to use the same language so that
 
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
it's always you know it's not in
 
00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.190 align:start position:0%
it's always you know it's not in
question

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you I agree and I also think
 
00:24:34.029 --> 00:24:34.039 align:start position:0%
that if you're talking about it in a
 
00:24:36.389 --> 00:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
rule that the the header language ought
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
to agree with what's below because the
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
the header language says one of the
 
00:24:42.669 --> 00:24:42.679 align:start position:0%
options is alternate
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
education and the details are for
 
00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
alternate um
 
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
experience you're absolutely right I
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
didn't I didn't catch that thank you for
 
00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
catching that Madam chair it says
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
alternate education it doesn't say
 
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
alternate experience you're correct we
 
00:24:58.990 --> 00:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
can make that change that's that's
 
00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
it should be alternate Ed is that
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
alternate education or alternate
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
experience experience okay
 
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.549 align:start position:0%
experience experience okay
then

00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
um so then that makes the other one
 
00:25:10.799 --> 00:25:12.110 align:start position:0%
um so then that makes the other one
comparable

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
comparable
 
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
education which is education that
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
they've received that is comparable to
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.669 align:start position:0%
 
requirements

00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:25:26.679 --> 00:25:29.230 align:start position:0%
requirements
um

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:29.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
required a license it doesn't so if
 
00:25:37.149 --> 00:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
someone were to have worked in the field
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
for some time and just decide to take
 
00:25:41.549 --> 00:25:41.559 align:start position:0%
the exam that's that's all they need to
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
exam that's what the board is allowing
 
00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
for yes okay thank you that's
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
else I have a question yes in in
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
statutes or in bills that we've seen
 
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
we've used the word substantially
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
similar have we eliminated that term now
 
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.549 align:start position:0%
similar have we eliminated that term now
for

00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
comparable so that we should I mean the
 
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
statutes should reflect the same
 
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
language as the rules I would think well
 
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
in this case the education that it's
 
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
comparable to is not well defined right
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
so I I think
 
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
uh I think you could just delete
 
00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.990 align:start position:0%
uh I think you could just delete
comparable

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
comparable
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
education it's the word the comparable
 
00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:36.039 align:start position:0%
they can seek leny by passing the exam
 
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
by having education by having experience
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
or by
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
endorsement would that would that be
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
agreeable changing the changing the
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
applicant shall seek Lure
 
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
by you saying take out e Al together
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
or comparable Al together yeah taking
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
out just com because you define in that
 
00:27:05.389 --> 00:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
subparagraph um you define what kind of
 
00:27:07.389 --> 00:27:07.399 align:start position:0%
education they need to
 
00:27:10.269 --> 00:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
have but nowhere else is there the
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
mention of the education that is
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
comparable to but you know here an
 
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
seeking lenser by education will show
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
shows their transcript their uh their
 
00:27:24.909 --> 00:27:24.919 align:start position:0%
grades and so forth I mean that's that's
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
the education so what I would have to
 
00:27:29.389 --> 00:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
look back and see in other parts of the
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
rules if there's a description of
 
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:33.640 align:start position:0%
education and if we were to say
 
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:37.559 align:start position:0%
comparable to that education as defined
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
in sure would solve the issue or just
 
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:44.200 align:start position:0%
leave it leave out the comparable here
 
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
because that's that looks like a pretty
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid I'm afraid to change well I
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I'd have to ask the board
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
because this one is is this going to
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
affect what
 
00:27:56.519 --> 00:27:58.029 align:start position:0%
affect what
they

00:27:58.029 --> 00:27:58.039 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:27:59.909 --> 00:27:59.919 align:start position:0%
originally asked for I'm gonna have to
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
bring this back to the board I'm not
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
sure what they're going to want to do
 
00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.070 align:start position:0%
sure what they're going to want to do
all

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
right so um M ree I was just going to
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
say you know the we could postpone this
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
to allow um Tina to to confer with the
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
board um if we do that the committee
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
will need a waiver of its um deadline if
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
from if I was understanding right it
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
looks like in that paragraph a um
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
chairwoman Maguire you were thinking to
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
remove comparable education and then
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
have it just say having received a
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
alternative alter alternate experience
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
or by endorsement I do not want to
 
00:28:42.509 --> 00:28:42.519 align:start position:0%
delete the the
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
phrase I do not want to delete The
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
Mention Of Education okay and I think
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
that if you look down below the
 
00:28:54.909 --> 00:28:54.919 align:start position:0%
education that's required to to request
 
00:28:58.509 --> 00:28:58.519 align:start position:0%
Alliance and a license is pretty well
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
defined the question is what's it
 
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.590 align:start position:0%
defined the question is what's it
comparable

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:06.519 align:start position:0%
to if it's not comparable to anything
 
00:29:08.509 --> 00:29:08.519 align:start position:0%
specific in other parts of the rules I
 
00:29:10.669 --> 00:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
think just education would cover it
 
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
nicely but that's and and these
 
00:29:14.669 --> 00:29:14.679 align:start position:0%
components being part of what's accepted
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
education yeah let me look back let me
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
see what's in the rest of the rules and
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
take it back to the board and come back
 
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
with something if we could get a
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
postponement that would be great okay
 
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
director Mor
 
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
um I think Tina do you know when the
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
board meets
 
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
next not off the top of my head it's got
 
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.350 align:start position:0%
next not off the top of my head it's got
to

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
be there someone has that answer behind
 
00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:48.190 align:start position:0%
be there someone has that answer behind
[Laughter]

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
you surpris Doo s how oplc general
 
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
counsel um the Board of Nursing is
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
actually meeting right now so it's going
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
to be at least another month before they
 
00:29:59.710 --> 00:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
meet I just wanted to put that out there
 
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
okay well that's uh let's hurry up and
 
00:30:04.509 --> 00:30:04.519 align:start position:0%
let you go talk to them before they uh
 
00:30:04.519 --> 00:30:06.470 align:start position:0%
let you go talk to them before they uh
break

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
break
 
00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
up okay an alternative would to be to do
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
a preliminary objection and then let the
 
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
board in the time that it needs but well
 
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
let's uh take a look at the rest of the
 
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
rule and see if there are any other
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
issues that need to be address before we
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh just consign it to the uh okay I I
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
had one other point um in attorney ree's
 
00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
first comment she had noted that in
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
statute uh licensure by comparable
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
education is allowed for LPNs and it's
 
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
allowed for RNs but statute doesn't say
 
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
anything about lnas and it seems like if
 
00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
they wanted to do that they should seek
 
00:30:46.159 --> 00:30:47.909 align:start position:0%
they wanted to do that they should seek
statutory

00:30:47.909 --> 00:30:47.919 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:55.240 align:start position:0%
point I think um some of the the other
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
comments I had um the legislative intent
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
comments you're going to see throughout
 
00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:02.559 align:start position:0%
the rest of the document um there are
 
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
some that we've talked about before
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
related to the fee so I won't spend any
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
time on that the other ones were because
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
um the rules have been expired since
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
March so um that's not a terribly long
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
time but that has been since March 22nd
 
00:31:21.629 --> 00:31:21.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
year so with regards to the expiration
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
of these rules I looked back and I went
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
through the rsas and anything um that
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
was would have been enforced is in
 
00:31:34.509 --> 00:31:34.519 align:start position:0%
statute um
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
qualifications um exams that's all laid
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
out right in statute and there have been
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
and I also looked to see if there was
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
any disciplinary actions taking on
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
anything and there was
 
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
not oh good to
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
know any other comments or or
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
questions represent hackin Phillips um
 
00:31:57.549 --> 00:31:57.559 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I'd like to move to postpone
 
00:32:00.629 --> 00:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
with a waiver uh so that the oplc has a
 
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
chance to coordinate with the board on
 
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
this one
 
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
okay second second by representative
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
Schmidt any discussion of the of the
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
motion all right those in favor I
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
opposed all right yes please it's
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
disconcerting to see uh
 
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:25.480 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies all right physical
 
00:32:32.629 --> 00:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
2023-the this proposal was also
 
00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
postponed from the last meeting so that
 
00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:40.120 align:start position:0%
the rules could be amended to accurately
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
reflect that the oplc is processing
 
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
licensing applications and the board has
 
00:32:48.269 --> 00:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
filed an amended conditional approval
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
and it has addressed that concern there
 
00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
are some other legislative intent
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
comments um at the last meeting the
 
00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
committee had discussed that that some
 
00:32:59.149 --> 00:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
of the rule sections have been expired
 
00:32:59.159 --> 00:33:00.350 align:start position:0%
of the rule sections have been expired
since

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
2021 and there's a a question again on
 
00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
the collection of fees during the rules
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
expiration um from Rebecca's notes it
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
looks like um or attorney ricard's notes
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
it looks like that this issue was
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
discussed last time and so we may not
 
00:33:18.509 --> 00:33:18.519 align:start position:0%
need to revisit it but I thought I would
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
um bring it to your attention in case
 
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
you do um also at the last meeting
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
Senator gray had recommended that the
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
board pursue alleged islative fix to
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
make it clear that submitting late
 
00:33:32.629 --> 00:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
documentation in response to an audit
 
00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:35.559 align:start position:0%
request will be considered professional
 
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
misconduct and um that's in response to
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
the comment on page 11 of the amended
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request um just so
 
00:33:45.549 --> 00:33:45.559 align:start position:0%
you are aware there have been other
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
board proposals um from other boards
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
that have included similar language and
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
um it's usually been taken out um so I'm
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
not really clear why in this case why it
 
00:34:01.389 --> 00:34:01.399 align:start position:0%
hasn't been done but um the issue was
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
that there's not there doesn't appear to
 
00:34:06.909 --> 00:34:06.919 align:start position:0%
be direct statutory Authority um the
 
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
board does have authority to implement a
 
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
fine for professional misconduct but the
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
issue is whether or not failing to
 
00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
submit documentation at all or either in
 
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
a timely manner whether or not that fits
 
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
the definition of professional
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
misconduct other than those issues there
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
were some questions about whether the
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
forms have been updated outside of the
 
00:34:32.109 --> 00:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process we some of them have
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
some addition dates from 2022 and
 
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
there's no record of any filing to
 
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
update them but anyway that broadly
 
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
summarizes the issues and like I said
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
many of these were discussed last time
 
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
and the the main reason for postponement
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
was to allow the board to clarify who is
 
00:34:52.829 --> 00:34:52.839 align:start position:0%
processing the um applications and
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
they've done that with the amended
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
conditional approval
 
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
request okay so first let me address the
 
00:35:02.349 --> 00:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
expired roles so going back and looking
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
at the expired rules they are small
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
portions of bigger sections so although
 
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
a certain section may be expired it also
 
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:13.079 align:start position:0%
is addressed further on in in the the
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
totality of the
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
section um I take it this package
 
00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
updates the entire section of rules and
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
not just slivers exactly yes thank you
 
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
um and then with regards to the fines
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
the board under um phy 40501 k a
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
violation of any of the rules is subject
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
to disciplinary action and
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
by providing fines for late submission
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
of Contin um audit materials it allows
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
for a few things it allows number one
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
that the ly knows exactly what's going
 
00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
to happen if they're late with their
 
00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
with their um documentation
 
00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
number two it gives them the option of
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
yes I was late I procrastinated I didn't
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
do it I'm going to pay the fine or if
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
they feel like there's bigger issues
 
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
they can um have a hearing before the
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
board and have it discussed otherwise if
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
they violate the the rules they have to
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
come in for a hearing and this gives
 
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
them greater flexibility to make that
 
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
determination as to whether it's not
 
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
necessary to have a
 
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
hearing um and I do believe believe that
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
under um that the board does have the
 
00:36:32.589 --> 00:36:32.599 align:start position:0%
ability to Levy
 
00:36:35.069 --> 00:36:35.079 align:start position:0%
fines that that is correct like I said
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
in my opening statement they do have the
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
authority to Levy fines the issue was
 
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not you know failing to
 
00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.069 align:start position:0%
whether or not you know failing to
submit

00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
submit
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
documentation was sufficient enough to
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
fall underneath professional misconduct
 
00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
and that's why Senator gray was
 
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
recommending that they pursue a
 
00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.589 align:start position:0%
recommending that they pursue a
legislative

00:36:50.589 --> 00:36:50.599 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
fix okay uh how how often does this well
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
how often are are the education records
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
audited and how often is the
 
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
documentation late they're supposed to
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
be audited once a year um or at not once
 
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
a year I'm sorry at renewal so that
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
could be that's once every two years um
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
so so every so you're not really audit
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
you're you're basically asking them to
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
submit the ceu
 
00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:24.280 align:start position:0%
documentation with their renewal no at
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
10% 10% of the like lies are audited ah
 
00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
thank you that makes more
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
sense any other questions comments
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
concerns representative hiken Phillips
 
00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
motion do we know what the appropriate
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
motion would be I'm just trying to
 
00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
figure out of which which category ises
 
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
this is it a move to approve move to
 
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
approve the the revised yes okay I move
 
00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
to approve the the revised rules all
 
00:38:08.109 --> 00:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
right second second by representative
 
00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
Lynn any further discussion those in
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.109 --> 00:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
much okay okay so um 2023 189 um oplc uh
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
practice and procedure rules the agency
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
has filed a conditional approval request
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
um that addressed some of our comments
 
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:37.480 align:start position:0%
but there are a lot that still remain um
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
you should have the conditional approval
 
00:38:39.119 --> 00:38:40.430 align:start position:0%
you should have the conditional approval
request

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:38:44.589 --> 00:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
um posted um for you to review but I'm
 
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
mostly going to be just talking about
 
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
the comments on the final proposal U
 
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
meeting packet so it would be best to
 
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:55.839 align:start position:0%
look at that um the first comment is on
 
00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
page five
 
00:39:00.309 --> 00:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
of the final proposal packet which is
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
going to be page one of the rule text
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
and here there's a comment that the
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
agency hasn't cited 310a in the rule
 
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
text or in the
 
00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:12.280 align:start position:0%
appendex the sections of the statute
 
00:39:14.829 --> 00:39:14.839 align:start position:0%
applying to the operations of the oplc
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
repealed however there are other
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
sections of 310a that the oplc will be
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
relying upon when conducting hearings
 
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
based on hearings on complaints and so
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
those sections should be at least
 
00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
referenced in the
 
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
appendex for example um The Proposal
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
talks about that um that the oplc will
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
receive complaints against lenses for
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
engaging in unregulated or engaging in a
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
regulated profession without a
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
license and let's say for instance
 
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
that's um you know engineering well then
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
um RSA 310 a25 would be applicable and
 
00:39:58.589 --> 00:39:58.599 align:start position:0%
it says that such a violation is a
 
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor thus RSA 310 a25 will be
 
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
enforced or at least relied upon and
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
should be mentioned in the
 
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
appendex and um in response in an email
 
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
response um between our office and the
 
00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
oplc IT stated that they've never cited
 
00:40:21.309 --> 00:40:21.319 align:start position:0%
the other statutes but it is worth
 
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
noting that back in September the
 
00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
committee approved a PLC interim rule
 
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
that also had this same exact issue in
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
which the oplc did not want to put did
 
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
not want to amend its appendex um the
 
00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
committee did tell the agency to amend
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
the appendix during the regular rul
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
making to include statutory Authority
 
00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
for statutory requirements that the oplc
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
is incorporating or relying upon to
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
enforce the rules or statutes regardless
 
00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
of whether they are oplc statutes or the
 
00:40:57.069 --> 00:40:57.079 align:start position:0%
board statutes so um our our position is
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
that they really do need to at least
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
amend the appendex to make sure it
 
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
accurately reflects what statutes they
 
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
will be enforcing anyway I I didn't know
 
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
if you want me to stop there before I
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
move on to the other comment I think
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's a point we want to settle before
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
we go
 
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
further good morning Douglas osterhout
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
general counsel for the oplc with me is
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
my um attorney who works with me Brenda
 
00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
golden Housey um I think we disagree I
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
think what we're talking about when
 
00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about all these other
 
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
statutes listed in rule are charging
 
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
statutes and what these rules apply to
 
00:41:35.309 --> 00:41:35.319 align:start position:0%
are the proceedings so the the
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
references that are being asked to put
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
in the rule are sort of those lists of
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
misconduct this is what happens after
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
the fact so the charging statutes and
 
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
the rules addressing hearings are very
 
00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
different and the other thing I'd like
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
to point out is
 
00:41:52.589 --> 00:41:52.599 align:start position:0%
that um misdemeanors are not handled by
 
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
the office we don't handle criminal
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
complaints that is covered by Department
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
of Justice we are a li a professional
 
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
licensing agency not a law enforcement
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
agency so those statutes don't really
 
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
apply to us as far as unlicensed
 
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
practice goes now the boards can take
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
action against an individual who does
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
unlicensed practice but they could not
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
find them guilty of a misdemeanor so it
 
00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:17.480 align:start position:0%
is important to distinguish between the
 
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
criminal action and the action taken
 
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
against the individual
 
00:42:26.549 --> 00:42:26.559 align:start position:0%
leny and we also have in plc 201102 and
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
B as provided in RSA 310 where our
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority comes from this
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
chapter shall apply to the professions
 
00:42:38.109 --> 00:42:38.119 align:start position:0%
listed in RSA 310 colon 2 Roman numeral
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
2 we point them directly to the list
 
00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.829 --> 00:42:48.839 align:start position:0%
to thank you so that if someone were
 
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
being um the board if the board of
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
Engineers were concerned about someone
 
00:42:57.309 --> 00:42:57.319 align:start position:0%
performing engineering without a license
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
they could do various investigatory
 
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:01.839 align:start position:0%
things against the license of the person
 
00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:03.880 align:start position:0%
or they could refer them to the attorney
 
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
general for prosecution for the
 
00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
okay comments
 
00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.510 align:start position:0%
okay comments
questions

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
concerns how Madam chair how does the
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
committee feel about having this
 
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
inconsistency um if we were to agree
 
00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
opl's um position here versus how we
 
00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
ruled earlier this year sounds like in a
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
idea so um as we move further down I've
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
got a um there are a lot of legislative
 
00:43:54.829 --> 00:43:54.839 align:start position:0%
intent comments and so um one thing we
 
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
were going to recommend is actually that
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
this item be postponed um because the
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
agency really need the they need more
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
time to go back through especially when
 
00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
you get to section 207 you'll see there
 
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
that um there are comments on the pages
 
00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
of 31 through 33 of the packet and here
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
they're attempting to address the
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
procedures for rulemaking for both the
 
00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
boards and the oplc but the problem is
 
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
is that um the requirements aren't going
 
00:44:28.109 --> 00:44:28.119 align:start position:0%
to be the same um the boards can't hold
 
00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
virtual hearings they can hold remote
 
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:32.200 align:start position:0%
hearings under specific circumstances
 
00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
but anyway um before I get too much into
 
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
that they're just um the oplc didn't
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
make any changes to that section in
 
00:44:41.549 --> 00:44:41.559 align:start position:0%
response to comments and they actually
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
stated that um had they gotten the
 
00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
comments back you know in a in a timely
 
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
manner then maybe they could have
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
addressed my comments or our comments so
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
um we really think that they need more
 
00:44:56.589 --> 00:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
time to to um to address those comments
 
00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
and to go through
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
them yes I think having a conflict
 
00:45:04.549 --> 00:45:04.559 align:start position:0%
between the rul making procedures of of
 
00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:07.640 align:start position:0%
a specific board and of the oplc in
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
general is not a good thing and I hope
 
00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:13.880 align:start position:0%
that in one of the many pieces of
 
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
legislation we'll be considering this
 
00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:20.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
addressed representative Schmidt well I
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
the idea of postponing to get to have
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
the time to do what we've just been
 
00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
talking about seems eminently reasonable
 
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
and appropriate to me so I'm happy to
 
00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
move uh to request um postponement NL
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
second okay any further comments or
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
questions Mr AER house you had a
 
00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
comment I don't agree that there's a
 
00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
conflict um first of all we did make a
 
00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
change to the 207's it wasn't we didn't
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
address every comment specifically but
 
00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
in 2071 we added a sentence um to
 
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
2071a we added the sentence the rules of
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
this part shall be construed and
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
implemented in compliance with the
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
requirements of RSA 91a in particular
 
00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
RSA 91 A2 relative to meeting of boards
 
00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:13.720 align:start position:0%
generally and RSA 91 a24 relative to
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
meeting of the state boards and I think
 
00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:17.480 align:start position:0%
what's really interesting here is that
 
00:46:19.549 --> 00:46:19.559 align:start position:0%
the statutory reference is exactly the
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
same they both reference RSA 91 A2 so I
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
don't think there's confusion
 
00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:26.839 align:start position:0%
additionally the way the rules are now
 
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
passed by the jail car we don't parse
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
them out
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
between the boards and the office now
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
policy-wise procedurally they may be a
 
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
little bit different because the boards
 
00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
and the office have different rules
 
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
governing by 91a
 
00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
541a but the statute we we have to
 
00:46:45.549 --> 00:46:45.559 align:start position:0%
comply with the statute as part of the
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
rule so I again disagree with OS
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
comments that this is conflicting or
 
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
it's unclear because we don't read these
 
00:46:55.309 --> 00:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
rules in a vacuum we read them in
 
00:46:55.319 --> 00:46:56.390 align:start position:0%
rules in a vacuum we read them in
totality

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
totality
 
00:46:59.790 --> 00:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
and in conjunction with the statutes be
 
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
they 91a 541a 310 The Practice Act
 
00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be so I don't I don't
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
see the confusion there if it's an oplc
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
meeting it follows the general uh 9182
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
statute and if it's a board meeting it
 
00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
follows that exception under R meeting
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
rule four uh for the
 
00:47:22.349 --> 00:47:22.359 align:start position:0%
boards okay it's very clear to
 
00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
me director Mor um in the conditional
 
00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
approval requests at the top of page two
 
00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:30.870 align:start position:0%
approval requests at the top of page two
in

00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
2071a um the attorney a how had talked
 
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
about the new language which states in
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
part the rules in this part shall be
 
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:42.440 align:start position:0%
construed and implemented in compliance
 
00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
with the requirements of
 
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:47.800 align:start position:0%
91a well if you look down to on the
 
00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
20714 C4 excuse me the there a
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
definition of virtual hearing well I
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
don't see how you can construe that
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
definition to be in compliance with 91a
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
when boards cannot hold a virtual
 
00:48:10.349 --> 00:48:10.359 align:start position:0%
hearing uh 91a
 
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
prohibits so I disagree that the add
 
00:48:15.319 --> 00:48:16.190 align:start position:0%
prohibits so I disagree that the add
added

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
added
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
language uh covers that
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
problem there's nowhere else in the rule
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
where a virtual healing for a board
 
00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
specifically is even cont cont plated it
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
might be easier just to remove that
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
definition if that would add Clarity but
 
00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
again these are the definitions lifted
 
00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.710 align:start position:0%
again these are the definitions lifted
from

00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:35.720 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
541a the question is are the
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
boards holding virtual hearings they
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
would not be because that would be in
 
00:48:46.349 --> 00:48:46.359 align:start position:0%
violation of
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
Statute okay represent I I really do
 
00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
think and um Mike and I talked about
 
00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
this that and Scott Eaton attorney Scott
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
Eaton as well that um PLC 207 really
 
00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
does need to be split apart to clearly
 
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
address the differences between the oplc
 
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
holding rulemaking hearings versus the
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
requirements on the boards for ruem
 
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
hearings like um director moral said the
 
00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
boards can't hold virtual hearings and
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
can only hold remote ones under specific
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances so the rules really need
 
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
to be clear about the requirements you
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
know what applies to what um and like I
 
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
said the agency had stated if they had
 
00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
gotten the comments back in you know in
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
a more timely basis they could have
 
00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
addressed it so I really feel like we
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
can give them some more time to do so
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
okay we we have a mo we are discussing a
 
00:49:39.549 --> 00:49:39.559 align:start position:0%
motion to do so any other comments
 
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
represent just you know what just to go
 
00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
back to like the first comment that was
 
00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.390 align:start position:0%
back to like the first comment that was
made

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:45.400 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
um uh on with regard to PLC 20 2.06 I
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
mean it does seem to me that isn't that
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
isn't the comment that was made by the
 
00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
staff well taken I mean that that
 
00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
the the the the if the the statute talks
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
about getting um provided that any
 
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
complainant shall have the opportunity
 
00:50:11.309 --> 00:50:11.319 align:start position:0%
before the settlement agreement has been
 
00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:14.200 align:start position:0%
approved uh to comment on the terms of
 
00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
the proposed settlement it doesn't but
 
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
you use the word consultation so that
 
00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that those things are
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
really considerably different um the
 
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
consult consultation suggest to me that
 
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
you know whoever is gonna whoever is
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
commenting has a right to have some
 
00:50:34.549 --> 00:50:34.559 align:start position:0%
discussion consultation with the B with
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
the decision maker as opposed to Simply
 
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
commenting on on something so that I
 
00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
mean I I guess I do think that that's a
 
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.510 align:start position:0%
mean I I guess I do think that that's a
valid

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
valid
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh criticism of The Proposal if I could
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
that comment was addressed and I
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
apologize to the committee it looks like
 
00:50:53.829 --> 00:50:53.839 align:start position:0%
that you do not have the conditional
 
00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:56.559 align:start position:0%
approval request posted so you can't see
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
it but they have addressed that comment
 
00:51:02.789 --> 00:51:02.799 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry sir we age I'm sorry we made
 
00:51:02.799 --> 00:51:03.829 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry sir we age I'm sorry we made
the

00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:08.309 --> 00:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
change okay director moral um a moment
 
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
ago attorney Reed had said that the
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
agency should have more time to split up
 
00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
207 the reason for this in part at least
 
00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
in part is it can be difficult to tell
 
00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
as it is what applies to oplc and what
 
00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
applies to the boards because as I was
 
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
talking about virtual hearings
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
departments which would include oplc can
 
00:51:35.309 --> 00:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
hold virtual hearings it's boards and
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
commissions that cannot they have to
 
00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
hearing okay so that's something that
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
could be clarified either by as you say
 
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
splitting up the rule into two parts or
 
00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
adding a separate section defining the
 
00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:57.160 align:start position:0%
differences for the boards may I propose
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
an alternate suggestion that we pass
 
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
these rules and we know we're going to
 
00:52:03.789 --> 00:52:03.799 align:start position:0%
be opening them up again because of
 
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
legislative changes in the near future
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
that because I do think these are better
 
00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:11.839 align:start position:0%
than the existing 200s which don't split
 
00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:13.880 align:start position:0%
make that distinction between the boards
 
00:52:16.789 --> 00:52:16.799 align:start position:0%
and the PLC we can function with these
 
00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:19.160 align:start position:0%
because we have the statutes to rely on
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with the rule and then we
 
00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
can address that down the
 
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
road okay we have a comment on to
 
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
postpone it to to incorporate some other
 
00:52:33.549 --> 00:52:33.559 align:start position:0%
changes which is the the matter on the
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
floor is there any further discussion on
 
00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:37.030 align:start position:0%
floor is there any further discussion on
that

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
motion okay those in favor of
 
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
postponing I opposed all right we will
 
00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
give you a chance to fix some of those
 
00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
things and then we will consider
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
adopting them with a recommendation to
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
go back into Ru making thank you very
 
00:52:54.240 --> 00:53:04.910 align:start position:0%
go back into Ru making thank you very
much

00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
okay um the next item is an interim rule
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
um from the Board of Education it's on
 
00:53:14.589 --> 00:53:14.599 align:start position:0%
school nurse lure and renewal um Ed uh
 
00:53:16.789 --> 00:53:16.799 align:start position:0%
Ed uh 504
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
rules um these are on School nurses the
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
rules are implementing SB 215 from the
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
last session and you should have a copy
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
of that in the packet um the change that
 
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
was made to the law would allow well
 
00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
actually requires School nurses to
 
00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:38.559 align:start position:0%
complete their ba within six years of
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
hire the agency has filed a conditional
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
approval request and you should have a
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
copy of that it pretty much resolved the
 
00:53:48.789 --> 00:53:48.799 align:start position:0%
issues we had on the initial interim
 
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
rule filing um the issues were mostly um
 
00:53:56.589 --> 00:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
editorial or currently mostly editorial
 
00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
but there is one comment on page three
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
of the conditional approval request and
 
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
it's an authority comment um this might
 
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:07.720 align:start position:0%
actually be an editorial comment too and
 
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
so if so then they really could address
 
00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
all these things during regular rule
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
making but anyway here uh we have a
 
00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
comment because the rule appears to
 
00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
allow School nurses school nurse 3s um
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
to be licensed in another state and
 
00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
practice in our state and we weren't
 
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
really sure whether that's allowable or
 
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
if the board of education has the
 
00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
authority to allow it so that is in
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
essence what that Comon is like I said
 
00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:37.480 align:start position:0%
it it could be an editorial matter here
 
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
um and if so it it can definitely be
 
00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
addressed during regular R making if
 
00:54:42.359 --> 00:54:48.390 align:start position:0%
addressed during regular R making if
so

00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
okay put push the button again till the
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
red light comes on there you go my name
 
00:54:56.069 --> 00:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
is Susan Blake I'm the administrator for
 
00:54:58.109 --> 00:54:58.119 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education Bureau of
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
credentialing um and this is Julie Shay
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
Julie Shay administrative rules
 
00:55:05.789 --> 00:55:05.799 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the Department of Ed
 
00:55:09.309 --> 00:55:09.319 align:start position:0%
with regard to um page three and the
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
question that you had um the reasoning
 
00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:16.799 align:start position:0%
behind it was to open up um to reduce
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
barriers to becoming a school nurse
 
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
three but um we will absolutely take out
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
we leave in this the New Hampshire P so
 
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
we will um limit it to people with a New
 
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire RN
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
license yeah it additionally um the
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
thought there was that because we were
 
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
quoting the RSA and how nursing is
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
defined um the attorney thought that um
 
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
taking out putting New Hampshire in
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
there was redundant because it's implied
 
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
that by following the statute that they
 
00:55:53.549 --> 00:55:53.559 align:start position:0%
would be licensed in New Hampshire that
 
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
being said if keeping in New Hampshire
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
there adds Clarity for the regular
 
00:55:59.710 --> 00:55:59.720 align:start position:0%
person that's reading that we're okay
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
with that so yeah I I thought that was
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
the situation but I wasn't entirely sure
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's why I had it unclear SL Authority
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
because I I thought maybe that was the
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
issue yeah because I think they would
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely have to be licensed in New
 
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um but it was yeah more of a
 
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
redundancy thing but for clarity I think
 
00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:20.720 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to keep it in and we're
 
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
happy to do that um all of the other
 
00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:25.430 align:start position:0%
happy to do that um all of the other
comments

00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
um and suggestions we are fine with um
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
adding in the proposal and then the one
 
00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
last thing I wanted to add is in C1 um
 
00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
that was also editorial that should just
 
00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:38.559 align:start position:0%
read as the italicized writing that says
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
the forms pursu in to Ed 508b and the
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
attestation I just didn't cross out the
 
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
rest of it
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
so that makes sense yeah so the the
 
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
essence is that you've worked out the
 
00:56:55.029 --> 00:56:55.039 align:start position:0%
details and all the changes required
 
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
editorial I mean um they could I guess
 
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
um you could decide to to do an A or
 
00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:05.720 align:start position:0%
could approve conditionally approve with
 
00:57:07.789 --> 00:57:07.799 align:start position:0%
them addressing these comments and their
 
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
conditional approval but yeah I I think
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's fine okay any other so moved so
 
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
moves Thank You by representative Lynn
 
00:57:22.109 --> 00:57:22.119 align:start position:0%
second and second okay any further
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
discussion all those in favor I
 
00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:29.720 align:start position:0%
opposed thank you very much thank
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
you all
 
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
right oh I'm watching right along the
 
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
northern border Alliance program yes
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
ma'am so um these are interum rules
 
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
implementing a new statute that provides
 
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
grant funding to border towns in the
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
North Country for uh police training the
 
00:57:51.549 --> 00:57:51.559 align:start position:0%
agency has filed a conditional approval
 
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
request which El eliminated all of the
 
00:57:57.510 --> 00:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
comments except for one and we um note
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
that that one really can be addressed
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
during regular Ru making um the comment
 
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
is on page five of the conditional
 
00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:06.559 align:start position:0%
approval packet and here um the
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
highlighted paragraph does a pretty good
 
00:58:11.309 --> 00:58:11.319 align:start position:0%
job of giving some basic parameters for
 
00:58:13.549 --> 00:58:13.559 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's discretion but it
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't give like some additional detail
 
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
for how the commissional commissioner
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
will decide whether to award one Grant
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
versus another Grant so in other words
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
there's you know could be some more
 
00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
detail there to ensure that Awards will
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
be uniformly applied now um while it's
 
00:58:35.829 --> 00:58:35.839 align:start position:0%
not required a point system is one way
 
00:58:38.109 --> 00:58:38.119 align:start position:0%
that other agencies have addressed um
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
discretionary decision making in the
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
grant or the RFP process um the manual
 
00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
does not address this issue directly
 
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
because it um addresses discretionary
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
decision making that's more of a yes or
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
no kind of decision um but but here what
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
you've got is a pool of money and um the
 
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
agency has to decide in essence which
 
00:59:04.029 --> 00:59:04.039 align:start position:0%
applicant is more deserving of that
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
money um for example how will it decide
 
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
um how will that decision be made if two
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
applicants have a very similar or almost
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
the same Grant proposal you know what
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
will be that ultimate deciding factor
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
weighing in favor of one over the other
 
00:59:23.829 --> 00:59:23.839 align:start position:0%
but anyway all that said um we feel like
 
00:59:25.789 --> 00:59:25.799 align:start position:0%
that this could certainly be addressed
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
during regular R making and we've often
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
seen where agencies aren't able to kind
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
of nail down all the details at the
 
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
interim rule process but are able to do
 
00:59:38.029 --> 00:59:38.039 align:start position:0%
so a little bit more in the regular rule
 
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
making process so this may just need a a
 
00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
sentence or two more to add some
 
00:59:45.029 --> 00:59:45.039 align:start position:0%
additional Clarity but but like I said
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:51.549 --> 00:59:51.559 align:start position:0%

business a couple of quick items um last
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
month you heard from a member of the
 
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
Executive Vice President of the New
 
01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Builders Association regarding
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
alteration of terrain rules that the
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
committee had approved a few months ago
 
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh Dees was also here uh they have been
 
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
sitting down and talking but the
 
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
Builders Association has asked that
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
instead of coming back this month uh
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
that they come back next month and they
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
hope to have uh more for the committee
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
yes I also heard from the builders and
 
01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
they did in fact convince Dees that
 
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
there was an issue with certain portions
 
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
of the rule and they are working to
 
01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
solve it so I'll be delighted to wait a
 
01:01:56.109 --> 01:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
month to find out what they're doing
 
01:01:58.829 --> 01:01:58.839 align:start position:0%
the the other item was just to note that
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
