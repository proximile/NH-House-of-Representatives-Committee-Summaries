00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Thank you.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:58.500
opening the committee of conference on house bill 1130 and welcome to at least two people who have until this year not been on such before representative actin and representative king from a you got that yeah from the health and human services committee the best committee in the house as you know well i'm on the senate side i know you are you can um one uh i have side by sides here in case anybody hasn't gotten them yet i think uh denise does we'll just see if the nephew does okay oh my gosh i've heard that oh it was Denise does?

5
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.000
We'll just see if the nephew does.

6
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Okay.

7
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Oh, my gosh.

8
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I heard that.

9
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Oh.

10
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It wasn't original.

11
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.500
We'll take him out to the woodshed.

12
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.500
Not the woodshed again.

13
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.500
All right.

14
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.500
There's really two parts to this.

15
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:44.500
The original bill, as you can see from the side-by-side, the agree it's the restroom act it's very special conditions and we put in some safety and all of that the second part that somehow got attached to this is marriage license and registration.

16
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.500
And sometimes...

17
00:01:46.500 --> 00:03:07.000
somehow got attached to this is marriage license and registration and sometimes one special case is still a precious person and needs to be addressed but sometimes one special case doesn't always make the best law and so um we we do what we can and there were some questions about it and patricia lovejoy once of the house and now a senior deputy secretary of state raised some objections but senator avard now to the rescue would you like to present yes uh basically um i i did uh go to the the secretary of state um mr scanlan and i addressed the issues and he said well and then he he did some research for me as well and he said if you just add after a town clerk uh if unable or before town clerk if so on line 15 it says if either party is unable to appear in person the city clerk or town Thank you.

18
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:36.000
unable or before town clerk if so on line 15 it says if either party is unable to appear in person the city clerk or town clerk if unable shall accommodate and uh that that made all his worries go to flight so and i i spoke with him this morning about it could i ask please uhhuh.

19
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.500
So all I have is the side-by-side in front of you, so I don't have my name.

20
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:52.500
You're proposing if either party is unable to appear in person, the city or town clerk...

21
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.500
If unable.

22
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.500
If unable.

23
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.500
Shall accommodate.

24
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.500
Well, the city or town clerk can't do anything if they're unable.

25
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.500
Shall accommodate.

26
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.000
if they are not able to go in person.

27
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.500
Oh, they shall accommodate the parties and they're going to authorize the JG?

28
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.500
I'm sorry.

29
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.500
I really have difficulty with that.

30
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.500
I'm sorry.

31
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.500
I interrupted.

32
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.500
Sure.

33
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:43.000
And what I'll just let you know that what happened is that the Hollis, not Hollis, Hudson, after – well, let me just give you the story behind this.

34
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:54.000
was an individual two blocks away from town from from city hall a gentleman uh who didn't actually he couldn't speak English.

35
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.500
He had a difficult time speaking English.

36
00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.500
He needed an interpreter.

37
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.000
He was in hospice two blocks away.

38
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.500
Before he died, he wanted to marry his partner.

39
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:46.000
And so he called up and he said senator would you mind going to the clerk's office and and through the interpreter and getting the information so i went to the clerk's office and i said uh you know i'm here on his behalf and would you or on their behalf and would you mind me you know doing this for them and they said what state state law and city ordinances say you can't do that.

40
00:05:46.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And so I left, I made some phone calls, and we had some people that were going to donate so that they could go get an EMS to bring him there to the office so that he could fill out the paperwork.

41
00:06:07.000 --> 00:07:09.500
I went back in and I said, is it okay if I get an ams to come in and help out in this situation and um they said yeah that's fine and by the way senator i i was incorrect it's just our office policy oh interesting so uh i left and then we did some more research and hudson was gracious enough to come and do it and accommodate across the river and come over and do it uh but apparently this happens uh very infrequently but they were able to do it and i thought you know this guy's just two blocks away there wasn't anybody in there there was nobody in there the parking lot was empty like honestly Honestly, so, um.

42
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.500
I just feel that, uh, that.

43
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.500
Your office policy is very cold.

44
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.000
And that generated this bill.

45
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I appreciate the explanation and I'm very sympathetic to the plight of your constituent.

46
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000
But as the chair has said, single bad experiences make for very bad law.

47
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:51.000
I have spoken to my town clerk who said, of course in a situation like that, we have a clerk, we have a deputy, one of us would go to the house of the person and accommodate them.

48
00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And that is what has happened in many cases and should happen in every case and actually did happen in your case.

49
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
You found another clerk who could go and do it.

50
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
From another town.

51
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
From another town.

52
00:08:11.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And that's, you can get married anywhere in the state with a marriage license from any town so the accommodation actually worked um i would be more comfortable with this if we make it clear that the city or town clerk has to do the accommodation rather than involving the justice of the peace that's that's the whole point well but you said that should they shall accommodate the parties by authorizing a new hampshire jp to act on behalf of the town clerk why don't we just compel the town clerk why don't we compel the town clerk to go and do it i'm with you 100 thank you um i you know you would say the town clerk shall accommodate it shall make yeah i i'm just thinking of how to how to say it the town clerk shall accommodate the parties by meeting with them where they are able by meeting with them at any spot in the town in which they are able to appear and that way they'd if if the person from walpole is in a nursing home in manchester the town clerk doesn't have to go there but their town clerk goes goes right so let me try writing this out sorry i guess we need to use the mic um i'm just wondering if the town clerks will be nervous because this could be abused because it said if either party is unable to appear in person but it doesn't give a why should we have due to medical reasons if you want to put that in there yeah for medical reasons such as hospice okay do you want to have a medical note or do you want to just say for medical reasons?

53
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
For medical reasons, yeah.

54
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Okay.

55
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:52.500
And as we talk about it, I'm really getting back to the point of why do we need to put this in statute?

56
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.500
Because you have one bad apple.

57
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.500
I get it.

58
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:11.500
but it seems to me that the answer to that is better training and more firm training by the Secretary of State's office rather than putting into statute.

59
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:31.500
because I can also see, now that I'm going down the rabbit hole here, there may be places or situations into which a town clerk might not wish to insert themselves because they might not feel safe for whatever reason.

60
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:40.000
And I don't feel really comfortable compelling them into a situation in which they don't feel safe.

61
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And again, I don't, it's, that is more somebody who's going to misuse the statute rather than otherwise.

62
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
But...

63
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Mr.

64
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Chair, can I respond to that?

65
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
I agree that's a rabbit hole.

66
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:07.500
There's nothing precluding them from taking the local law enforcement with them if they don't feel comfortable.

67
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:12.500
But I think all of these are very rare situations.

68
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:29.000
And what I think the underlying need is to make sure that this accommodation occurs in a reasonable situation like medically unable to attend or medically unable to get to the clerk's office.

69
00:12:29.000 --> 00:13:00.000
If the clerk feels uncomfortable, there's nothing stopping them from taking an escort with them just my two cents i agree i have a quick quick question representative acton thank you um i'd have to concur with representative weber in in that i just wonder have have we made the point already to the clerks that they need to clean this up?

70
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:13.000
A lot of times just introducing the law and taking it this far gets the message across to them that they need to change this behavior.

71
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:24.000
I did consider that, but I also consider the fact that if we don't go forward, that we also send a message.

72
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:34.500
As the designated grumpy one today, if they don't do it, we'll shame the hell out of them in the press.

73
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.500
I just assume not have to do that.

74
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:43.500
Well, I mean, I don't like to do that now.

75
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:50.000
I don't like to use a big stick either, but I have one.

76
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.500
I could do that now.

77
00:13:52.500 --> 00:14:31.500
And I chose rather to than to do that and to shame anybody because uh you know in addition you know i looked at the the clerk and i just said i'm not mad at you i'm not angry with you this is office policy uh i i don't that that just that's a spiral that i don't want to go down there's enough bad stuff out there already i just assume look, you're going to do it.

78
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:45.500
So even if we're not shaming the clerk, who's only acting under orders, we could have some publicity about how the policy in this community needs to change.

79
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:50.000
We could, or we could just make the change.

80
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Okay.

81
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.500
And I think Representative Weber's cooking up an amendment here of some sort.

82
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:08.000
I like your idea of the clerk having to do it and that they could, you know, if you...

83
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.500
Well, I think it has...

84
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:26.500
My bottom line is it has to be the clerk because it has to be somebody who knows the right kinds of documents and the right kinds of things to look for.

85
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.000
And it is their responsibility.

86
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:36.000
They shouldn't have to be taking that responsibility just on a photograph of documents.

87
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.500
But I'm, I'm diddling with language here.

88
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.500
And I'm I'll propose the language.

89
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:54.000
I may, I may not be able to agree to it at the end, but I'll propose the language because I like words.

90
00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:19.000
If either party is unable to appear, and we're not sure about whether we're putting medical reasons in there or not, the city or town clerk shall accommodate the parties by meeting in person with the parties at such other location within the city or town as may be convenient?

91
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Well, if somebody's in hospice and they can't be moved.

92
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
That's another location in the city or town as may be convenient.

93
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Okay, that's okay.

94
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:43.000
I mean, for that person, there's only one place that's convenient, but I need it to be in the city or town.

95
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:52.000
That means they're not forced to do a house call if there's another spot that they can do.

96
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Right.

97
00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:08.000
I don't know why they wouldn't want to do a house call or why you wouldn't just, you know, take an extra person along if you were on.

98
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.500
And, you know, if it's a hospice patient, it's a hospice.

99
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.000
You're just going to hospice.

100
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
I don't understand why somebody wouldn't just go to hospice.

101
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:38.500
And I'm, I mean, I really do think that sparing the feelings of the clerk in question here is a little much, because I certainly know of all kinds of accommodations that my clerk made.

102
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:50.500
For example, when my husband was ill and unable to get from the car into the town clerk's office, the town clerk came out.

103
00:17:50.500 --> 00:18:02.500
And had he, I mean, there were offers to bring him ballots, for example, and other things at the house, should he need it.

104
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.500
I have actually lived this situation.

105
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:11.500
And I really think that the issue here is not the law.

106
00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:21.000
The issue is the person and the policy, which just seemed to me to be staggeringly out of touch.

107
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
I would agree it's staggeringly out of touch.

108
00:18:25.000 --> 00:19:07.000
I also think that if not forced, if somebody just has either an ego problem or just having a bad day somebody is being disenfranchised from the services which should be provided whether through sickness or whatever and i just feel that um i don't think this is this is earth shaking i don't think this is going to to all of a sudden make the whole state tremble because the clerks have to at least come up with some kind of a plan.

109
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:15.500
But human nature being as it is, if somebody's having a bad day, somebody can be disenfranchised.

110
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:22.500
And I just – I have issues with that, and I just witnessed it.

111
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:30.000
It took a senator to go on behalf of one individual and get turned down.

112
00:19:30.000 --> 00:20:10.000
It took a senator because other people were attempting apparently prior to me so i'll call my senator and we still got shot down so if a senator can't do it if a state representative or or people that are in the community can't do it there's an issue shaming Shaming, I don't think, we can shame all day long, but if there's an arrogance or a situation where there's intransigence, it doesn't fix the problem, people get left behind.

113
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.500
So I just, I'm pretty, you know, I was really offended by this.

114
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.500
I was heartbroken.

115
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.000
I literally, I got all choked up.

116
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
I'm leaving the place.

117
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
I'm thinking, are you kidding me?

118
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.500
This is just office policy.

119
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.000
I'm still getting choked up.

120
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:39.000
And, you know, if a senator can't get it done because somebody's in training.

121
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.500
But you did, and it was done.

122
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.000
I would add, if I might, Mr.

123
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Chair, that even if it's not office policy, currently a clerk could refuse to do this.

124
00:20:54.000 --> 00:22:01.500
So we don't know how big a problem it is, but we know it's a problem that either whether it's policy or not a clerk right now can refuse to do to accommodate somebody who can't come into the office i have worked with many of the clerks across the state when i was on the select committee and i'm i'm appalled number one that it's policy and i would be appalled if a clerk didn't do it but they can and i think this closes that loophole without being onerous in addition i i just want to reiterate that this individual he only spoke spanish and uh he didn't know where else to cry out to so there there's a voice there that okay you get shot down um it's who's going to know?

125
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.500
Right?

126
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:13.500
You're not part of the commonwealth, if you will, or the general public where your complaint's going to be noted.

127
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:20.000
Would Representative Weber read the draft as we have it so far, please.

128
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Okay.

129
00:22:22.000 --> 00:23:09.500
If either party is unable to appear in person, and the question is whether you put in or leave out for medical reasons, but I've got it there sort of hanging, the city or town clerk shall accommodate the parties by meeting with the parties, by meeting in person with the parties sorry at such other location within the town or city city or town as may be convenient I like it so do we put in for medical reasons or not I would because I don't want it to be a free-for-all, you know?

130
00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.500
Right, right, yeah.

131
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.000
I ran out of gas.

132
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
No, sorry.

133
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.500
I didn't want to come into town next Tuesday.

134
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:24.000
You drive out to the farthest reach.

135
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.500
Right, so for medical reasons.

136
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:46.000
Now, the way I've been running committees of conference so far and have not been yelled at for doing it is that we don't have to run down to OLS, get the amendment, bring it back, vote on it.

137
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
This is the amendment.

138
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:57.500
Once it is written on a fresh piece of paper, I'll march it down and if we all agree.

139
00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.500
Sam Hill.

140
00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:11.000
Nice bipartisan bill and I think it just helps those that might be I'll see it down, and if we all agree, submit.

141
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Nice bipartisan bill, and I think it just helps those that might be isolated, and I think it's another way of us working together and sending a message that we do care about the individuals that maybe it is one.

142
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.500
We've heard that phrase before.

143
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.500
One left behind is too many.

144
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.500
Thank you.

145
00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:42.500
You're writing my blurb, you know, right now.

146
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.500
Yeah.

147
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.500
I appreciate that, Mr.

148
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.500
Chair.

149
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.500
I just...

150
00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.500
It says this...

151
00:24:52.500 --> 00:25:02.500
I think, if anything, it sends a signal that we can work together for those that don't have a voice.

152
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.500
I don't know.

153
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.500
And we're working together on it.

154
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.500
And Representative Weber wrote the language.

155
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:15.500
As a gastroenterologist, the underlying bill is two thumbs up.

156
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.500
Yeah, no doubt.

157
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:21.500
I have many patients who will be thrilled.

158
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.500
President J.C.

159
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.500
Penney is not.

160
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.500
No.

161
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:56.500
So we're gonna have one more read of the amendment written on a clean crisp piece of paper and then we're going to vote on it and then we're going to sing one verse only of kumbaya and then we'll go our ways and so far my morning today is starting off the way my morning did yesterday.

162
00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:06.000
And I'm hoping it won't turn out the way yesterday afternoon did, but I got another shot at it.

163
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Yes, you do.

164
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
We had a good day yesterday.

165
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
You had a what?

166
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Yeah, of course we did that.

167
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.500
We work like a event.

168
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.500
We like pilots.

169
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.500
Senator Guida.

170
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.500
What about Senator Guida?

171
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:33.500
We were talking totally unrelated to another bill in energy, and he put in the phrase forever source.

172
00:26:33.500 --> 00:27:11.000
What do you think about it when she's making a pilot program and of course he's a pilot uh-huh no i thought you were talking about a pilot light with a gas no no and so we all have to talk it would be fly by night that's my comeback oh it's getting a little thick here I've finished writing maybe I would be a good time for me to reread this one more time.

173
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Would the honorable gentle lady from Cheshire County please read?

174
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
What I've got here is 5A.

175
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:33.000
If either party is unable to appear in person for medical reasons, the city or town clerk shall accommodate the parties by meeting in person with the parties.

176
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
So it's both parties.

177
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:44.500
It's got to be both parties at such other location within the city or town as may be convenient.

178
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:50.500
All in favor of that for the second half of the bill.

179
00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.500
Yes?

180
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.500
Aye.

181
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.000
We did for medical reasons.

182
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Do you want to read it again, Mr.

183
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Chairman?

184
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:21.500
If either party is unable to appear in person for medical reasons, comma, because it should be, the city or town clerk shall accommodate the parties by meeting in person with the parties at such other location.

185
00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.500
You have it singular?

186
00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:27.000
One location because both parties are together.

187
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Got it.

188
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.500
Within the city or town as may be convenient.

189
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.000
Senator Sherman had your hand.

190
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Oh.

191
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
I'm voting, yes.

192
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Okay.

193
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:50.500
And the first, all right, now let's just take a look at the first part of this.

194
00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.500
This is.

195
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:57.000
There were no changes, as far as I know.

196
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
We all agree then.

197
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Yes.

198
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Because we already did.

199
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.500
Okay, so I like the Senate version, and you like the House version.

200
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.500
Yes.

201
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.500
And we agree.

202
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.500
All right, we're done.

203
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.500
Thank you all.

204
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.500
Thank you.

205
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:30.000
Thank you very much and I'll mark will you be my neighbor oh let's take the trolley to wherever it goes.

206
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
All right, good.

207
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Thank you.

208
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000

Thank you.

245
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Thank you.

246
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Thank you.

256
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Thank you.

257
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Thank you.

258
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Thank you.

259
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000

260
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Thank you.

262
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Thank you.

263
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Thank you.

264
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Thank you.

265
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Thank you.

266
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Thank you.

267
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Thank you.

268
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Thank you.

269
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Okay, so that's...

270
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.500
So that means we should use our microphones, and there's our last member.

271
00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:55.000
John Janadian, do you know, I don't know if you know, Don, Stasandro, Daniel, John, you should probably come over here.

272
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Thank you.

273
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.500
You know, I don't know.

274
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:03.000
Yeah, you're trying to come over here.

275
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
All right.

276
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.500
Okay, yeah, it's 11 o'clock so I'm sharing this.

277
00:32:09.500 --> 00:33:04.500
So I will call the this committee of conference on house bill 355 to order and uh we did the introductions uh i i just let me start by let me just set this up we got we got house bill 355 last winter it's a three digit number was one that we had retained in the house the initial reaction was we weren't that interested in doing this at all but we did hear testimony from the grocers and the convenience store guys uh and we kind of slept on that over the summer and we we reconvened so what the bill calls for originally was for, back up.

278
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:10.000
Right now, Keno is just offered in establishments that pour liquor.

279
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
We all know that.

280
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Okay.

281
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:24.500
So, so that, and I was on the original subcommittee looking at Keno years ago that came up with this restriction.

282
00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:31.500
We didn't feel like having any convenience stores or the look wasn't that good.

283
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:40.500
You know, to have screens everywhere, gathering groups of people in a convenience store or a grocery store.

284
00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:59.000
so when we heard testimony from the grocers and the convenience store people, they were saying, you know, sometimes people in a restaurant will leave before the number comes up, and they're going to have to cash.

285
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:07.000
They go to, you can cash your ticket out anywhere, anywhere that has a lottery machine.

286
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:13.500
So they were complaining that, wow, you know, we're doing all the work.

287
00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:20.500
We're cashing these keynote tickets out, but we're not getting any remuneration for it.

288
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:26.500
So, okay, we kind of listened to them and we heard them.

289
00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:42.500
So in the last fall in our meeting, it was, again, a retained bill, we came up with a compromise and we said, okay, you can sell keynote tickets, but no screens.

290
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:50.500
We don't want screens displaying the numbers where people would gather waiting there for the numbers.

291
00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:56.000
And so that's the compromise that we had come up with.

292
00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.500
And the voter out of our committee was 19 to 5.

293
00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.000
We had 24 members then.

294
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Then, and the prime sponsor of the bill was on Ways and Means then, and he actually made the motion.

295
00:35:14.000 --> 00:36:59.500
Just tell you how he made the motion on the amended bill so when it went over to the senate committee and i i was there that day i wasn't going to testify and i was going to testify in the next bill um and i i did express a lot of this to the committee that um we really weren't in expanding keynote in this way in which there's the screens and this is not uncommon Charlie McIntyre is here he said you know there are places that would call I think there's some that call it keynote to go and that's basically basically what this is kino to go without the screens so that's and we we would like to uh our position is that we would we would like uh our our position to be considered the senate did consider the position and i think we fall on the side of if a community wants to authorize kendo to be played there and store owners want to have a screen i would question why no screen if the people that are the responsible parties both the community and also the store owner um says it's okay i'm sure if there's crowds in the store there are Thank you.

296
00:36:59.500 --> 00:38:11.500
people that are the responsible parties both the community and also the store owner um says it's okay you know i'm sure if there's crowds in the store there are fire restrictions on the numbers of people and a store owner is not going to let a crowd develop so you know again i to me it seems like a specious interference in the conduct of business we note that as of today our revenues from lottery are down the price of gas is going up and so an additional revenue stream won't hurt us so that mean my concerns would be why are we bothering to interfere with the conduct of business if it's not in any way directly harming the state yeah yes you can respond that um yes you're correct one thing about keno it's it's an opt-in to the state.

297
00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.500
Yes, you're correct.

298
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:18.500
One thing about Keno, it's an opt-in to the community.

299
00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:24.000
But you know in those votes how many people really vote.

300
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:31.500
So let's say there's one grocery store in town or one convenience store in town.

301
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:39.500
And I go in and all I see is gambling going on in front of me.

302
00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:42.000
I don't really like it.

303
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:50.000
I mean, I think our position is representing what I think most people would consider reasonable.

304
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
I would offer that.

305
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.500
I don't know a grocery.

306
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:59.500
I'm just going to put an array of screens up.

307
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:23.500
I might be willing to consider one screen limiting the number of screens but to say no screens to me seems counterproductive I'm wondering if that might be a position that the house might be what to consider no no we're not we're not willing to consider Mr.

308
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:39.500
Chairman I guess i guess i would question if a if a business if if a grocery store felt that a gathering of people waiting for numbers was interfering with the business.

309
00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:51.000
And I might argue that one of the possibilities might be that as they're waiting for numbers, that they're actually buying more things.

310
00:39:51.000 --> 00:40:04.500
there but why why would we not leave it to the business to decide whether it's detrimental to that numbers that they're actually buying more things there.

311
00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:14.500
But why would we not leave it to the business to decide whether it's detrimental to that business or not?

312
00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:28.000
I don't have any vested interest in that business, and I'm going to trust that probably none of us here have part ownership in a grocery store.

313
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:35.500
Or if we did, then we could go in and we could voice our opinion.

314
00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:44.500
But if it got too burdensome for businesses, then they have the option of taking the screen out.

315
00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:49.000
So we all remember when we didn't have Kino.

316
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:58.500
And Massachusetts was, you know, there were a lot of stores along the border at Keno, including Ted's Mobile.

317
00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:08.500
Ted's Mobile stripped, other than selling gas, they stripped out everything that they sold and they said Keno in there.

318
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.500
They created Keno parlors.

319
00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:21.000
So, I mean, there's no restriction here to prevent that from happening in all these other locations that we're talking about.

320
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
And we're not just talking about grocery stores.

321
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:36.000
We're talking about pharmacies as well, because any place that has a keynote machine and not a keynote machine, a lottery machine.

322
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:56.500
So I would again offer the possibility that maybe we limit to present keynote parlors to prevent prevent keynote parlors, we limit the number of screens to what would be an appropriate number, one, two, maybe base it on square footage.

323
00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:36.000
But again, I think there's a way to satisfy your concerns, which we would like to do, as well as to allow the grocers, the convenience stores and everybody else to maintain the option of how they want to run their business i think that's that's probably a good position yes uh dick as uh representative brahmi noted uh kino is an opt-in uh there had to be an affirmative municipal vote to have it in the first place.

324
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:48.500
And as we considered this further expansion of Kino into convenience stores and grocery stores, there was discussion about whether this expansion was consistent with.

325
00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:54.000
Or inconsistent with the proposal that municipalities that had opted in.

326
00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Acted on, in other words, they understood Keno in a certain way and was this inconsistent and we I think my recollection is that was this was discussed and our conclusion was it's okay if it's passive it's just buying selling tickets but it is an active screen is playing keynote and there's a substantial question of whether that would have made a difference in terms of the opt-in decision by the municipality in the first place because this is if you take the scenario suggested by representative Bromini is a substantial change for a small town that has one convenience store, for example, or one grocery store, and maybe another restaurant or two where they allow for Kino, but without the idea of it expanding into the other places.

327
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:08.000
So I just offer that as an additional consideration that I think steered our vote to some extent.

328
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000
Yes, representing the senator.

329
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:21.000
I'm going to go back and say, why are we as legislators trying to tell a business how to run the business?

330
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000
You know what?

331
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:48.500
If I hit a convenience store and I set up Kino and I noticed that there's a drop in my clients coming in, then, you know, I have the option of getting out of the business or getting rid of a screen or whatever it does to make that business successful.

332
00:44:48.500 --> 00:45:06.500
But when you've got something permissive that the community has accepted, the business has opted in, and now the legislature is saying, well, okay, but everything else is fine, but no, you can only do this.

333
00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:10.000
That does not make sense to me.

334
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:23.000
And, you know, it really just is a detriment to our economy if we're going to start thinking that we can run every business out there.

335
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:36.500
Well, first off, Representative Ames brought up a good point about the the if we're going to start thinking that we can run every business out there.

336
00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:48.000
First off, Representative Ames brought up a good point about the towns that have opted in, opted in for establishments that pour liquor.

337
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.500
That's what their understanding was.

338
00:45:50.500 --> 00:46:26.500
So there's no provision in here to go back and revote whether we want this in grocery stores grocery stores and in in convenience stores in our pharmacies or wherever uh that you know and uh i i i just think i mean as legislators i we we restrict certain things and in this case i just think it's a bad look and i'm i'm i'm gonna vote my conscience on that.

339
00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:28.500
It's a bad look.

340
00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:33.000
And I'm going to vote my conscience on that.

341
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.500
It's a bad look, I think, to have all of these.

342
00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.500
I mean, lottery, yes.

343
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.500
Lottery's been around.

344
00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:47.500
We're one of the oldest lotteries in the country, right?

345
00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:53.000
But it's kind of there, but it's not in your face.

346
00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:01.500
Putting screens up, it becomes in your face as a potential customer who may not like it.

347
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.500
And I'm going to defend them.

348
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:10.500
In which case, the customer can find another store or another restaurant.

349
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:22.500
In which case, the customer's feelings can be made evident to the owner of the store, who can then change his or her policy.

350
00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:29.500
We allow store owners to require injecting a serum as a condition of employment.

351
00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:31.500
We don't touch that.

352
00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:35.000
We're not going to interfere with businesses.

353
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:50.000
And yet here we are in something as basically, in my opinion, unnecessary and interfering in the conduct of business by businesses that have themselves expressed the desire for this.

354
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:57.500
They accept your edict as chair of Ways and Means because they have no option.

355
00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:08.500
I would submit that every business in the state wants to have that option, and I think we do them a disservice.

356
00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:11.000
Let them be the determinants.

357
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.500
They're the ones that run the business.

358
00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:17.500
The community knows that laws change.

359
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.500
We promise to pay retirement benefits.

360
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.500
And that changed.

361
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:25.500
So laws change all the time.

362
00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:40.000
Again, I think this is something that can be accomplished with people who are willing to compromise in this committee of conference to accomplish something that's reasonable and reasoned.

363
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.500
We can limit the number.

364
00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:45.000
We can limit the size.

365
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.000
Let the businesses choose whether or not they have them.

366
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000
And house wage means already compromised.

367
00:48:53.000 --> 00:49:03.500
This bill wouldn't have passed if we didn't do our compromise to say you can sell the tickets but no screen.

368
00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:05.500
It wouldn't have passed.

369
00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:08.500
And that's why we retained it.

370
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:14.000
It wasn't going to pass right away, and we retained it.

371
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000
So we already compromised on the house side.

372
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.500
And, look, I'm always pro-businessiness as anybody.

373
00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:27.000
So please, I don't want to appear like I'm restricting business.

374
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000
This is small.

375
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000
This is not huge.

376
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:41.000
And yes, it's a real attraction because we were very generous, very generous in the Kino establishments that use 8%.

377
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000
They get 8%, if you recall.

378
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000
That's really established.

379
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.500
I can understand why the grocers and the others.

380
00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:58.000
But they're going to get 8% by selling tickets behind the window without a screen.

381
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.500
It may not, maybe, it isn't like we said no, no.

382
00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:07.500
We said we just don't have the screen.

383
00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:11.500
So I know I'm not going to budge.

384
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:13.500
Take a recess.

385
00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.500
Thank you.

386
00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:19.500
so take a research yes yeah Thank you.

387
00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:21.500
Thank you.

388
00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:23.500
Thank you.

389
00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:37.500

All right.

397
00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Thursday's the possibilities if we get it in the morning, because I think we have until 3 o'clock Thursday to sign off.

398
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Right.

399
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.500
Didn't have any of the people to come in.

400
00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:18.500
So do you have a time in mind?

401
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:44.000
I don't have a time but i'd have to let my my schedule and my handler if you will take a look at that and he will get out to you post haste right let me take a look here yeah there's one at ten and we have one at 11.

402
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:57.500

Thank you.

576
00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:18.500
Okay.

577
00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:20.500
Good afternoon, everyone.

578
00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:25.000
I'll open the Committee of Conference on HB 1431.

579
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:43.000
And a lot of new information has been brought forward about this bill, particularly the information from the domestic violence advocates and from the Attorney General in concern that this could open us up to lawsuits.

580
00:58:43.000 --> 00:59:34.000
And also from, I had an email from the director of New Hampshire School Administrators Association also not to mention a lot of other emails but so I have some really deep concerns about this I do not want to see us putting kids it's such a fine line to remain parental rights and the child's rights and i just want to make sure that we're not setting kids up to self-harm to feel they have no one to talk to because while yes there are a lot of great parents out there, unfortunately, there are also some not-so-great parents out there.

581
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:42.500
And those are the kids that I feel are most vulnerable that I am deeply concerned about.

582
00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:44.500
So Senator Gannon, sorry.

583
00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:56.000
I was up in Conway speaking with a couple of principals yesterday doing some work up there, and we brought up this topic.

584
00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:11.000
And one of the principals did bring up that he said, you know, they're mandated reporters if it was a counselor, the teacher, the principal, whoever the student talked to.

585
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:53.500
And if they thought there was a danger, if they knew the parent to be a violent person if they knew the person they could report that to DCYF so there is a safeguard already in place that if they knew a parent was predisposed to be a danger in any way otherwise I think you're doing a disservice if you didn't tell me or someone else as a parent that my child was we'll just probably I think you're heading towards LGBTQ plus issues.

586
01:00:53.500 --> 01:01:10.000
If you're dealing with that and then you didn't tell me, wouldn't you be opening us the state up to liability because I wouldn't then know that my child potentially has an issue.

587
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I don't get them help because you've left me in the dark.

588
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.500
If you keep if you don't inform the parents.

589
01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:32.000
So I don't have a problem with, let's say, a counselor facilitating a conversation if the child says they feel okay with it.

590
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:42.500
But I'm concerned that a child will not even go and talk to a counselor now knowing that this is law.

591
01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:45.500
And that's what really concerns me.

592
01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:50.000
I don't want to keep parents in the dark.

593
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:58.500
You know, I think a lot of issues have been brought up over the past two years.

594
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:07.000
But this comes down to children's safety for themselves, not just from their parents, but from themselves.

595
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:22.500
If they feel they don't have anyone to talk to at that school, what are they going to do if they don't feel like they can talk to someone at home?

596
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:25.500
So that's where I'm really concerned.

597
01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:27.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

598
01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:44.000
And just, you know, staying on this issue that has been raised by, and I agree with you, Representative Rice, that some of these issues have come to us a little bit later.

599
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:54.500
And, you know, we didn't necessarily hear all these issues in the Senate and I think vice versa in the House.

600
01:02:54.500 --> 01:03:16.000
And I think it probably is the case that as the bill progressed, people took a closer look at it as they saw how the various bodies had amended it and were able to, you know, do a deeper dive into the implications.

601
01:03:16.000 --> 01:04:01.500
So I think i think you know i think we're in a space now where a lot of those implications are fleshed out and the unintended consequences are fleshed out but specifically on the lgbtq issue um i think we have to look at that issue also in the context of children's mental health because we know you, you know, setting aside the LGBT community, we know that there's been an increase in the need for children's mental health services and that we have seen more children at our emergency room.

602
01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:11.000
So this is a really critical time to make sure that we're getting kids into services that they need.

603
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:18.000
And of course, children are in school for the majority of their days, right?

604
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:30.000
And so school does need to be that place where if a child seeks counseling for whatever reason, that that is a safe place.

605
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:45.000
And, you know, we got some information from the Trevor Project, which is the world's, as they describe, the world's largest suicide prevention and mental health organization for LGBTQ youth.

606
01:04:45.000 --> 01:06:21.000
They said that last year they had they served over 660 contacts from New Hampshire and they fear that passage of this bill would only increase the need for their services which is you know we just don't want to be in a place where we're you know um children are scared to seek services and that they get to a point where they are you know at an elevated um you know elevated so much that they are considering suicide they also gave some really startling statistics about how um when children non-binary youth were asked about this bill and other bills like this they said that they were scared that bills like this make them scared and they and and for good And I think you know so many you know I know everyone on this committee are excellent parents and I and I um I know that I would want to know if my child was struggling but the reality is is that we don't know what's happening in everyone's home and yes children are uh teachers are mandatory reporters but they don't know what's going on at home.

607
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Absolutely.

608
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:39.000
It could be very likely that a school would have no idea whether a home would be a gender affirming space or a safe space for someone to explore their gender identity.

609
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:46.000
So we don't, the school district may not know if that's a dangerous place.

610
01:06:46.000 --> 01:07:16.500
And this this trevor project provided some data that only one and three transgender and non-binary youth report that their home is gender non-conforming furthermore 29 of lgbtq youth have experienced homelessness been kicked out or run away um and it goes on And so I just feel like it's just such a dangerous time to be messing with this balance.

611
01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:36.000
And, you know, I think because we've gotten all this information about children's mental health issues, LGBTQ issues, domestic violence issues, we received some information about how this could potentially be really dangerous for survivors and children of survivors.

612
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:50.500
So I think we I think we could all agree today that parental rights are important and fundamental and parents are, you know, the foundation of a child's life.

613
01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:54.500
But we this bill really upsets the balance.

614
01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:56.500
Thank you.

615
01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.500
Senator Carson, thank you.

616
01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:00.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

617
01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:05.000
Um, I'm, you know, we had our public hearing.

618
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Um, we didn't hear, we didn't hear anybody complain about LBGTQ folks, domestic violence.

619
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:24.500
So now at this point, I find it really offensive that we've been bombarded with bulk emails about how we're going to destroy these kids.

620
01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:29.000
This is not the way to have a conversation.

621
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:37.500
And I really am very, very concerned at the tactics of outside groups and what they're doing.

622
01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:42.500
We are here because we are concerned about our children.

623
01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:48.000
And the fact that parental rights have been eroded over time.

624
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.500
So it gets to the point where a parent is excluded.

625
01:08:53.500 --> 01:09:00.500
And, you know, I want to know, when did teachers become mental health counselors?

626
01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:02.500
When did that happen?

627
01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:09.500
Do they get a special designation with their license when they go to school?

628
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:14.000
They don't have the background to deal with that.

629
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.500
We hire teachers to teach.

630
01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:20.500
We hire administrators to administrate our school system.

631
01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:27.500
Do they have the background in order to do this, to handle this issue?

632
01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:39.500
Or should we now require it as part of their licensing that they now have to take classes and be licensed mental health counselors?

633
01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:43.000
Is that what we need to do?

634
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:50.500
I disagree with the fact that kids are in school the majority of the day.

635
01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:55.500
They're in school maybe five or six hours a day.

636
01:09:55.500 --> 01:11:27.000
The of the time they're with at they're at home or they're with their families including weekends so they're not with the school 24 hours a day and to think that a school is going to treat a child for some sort of mental issue that the child would be having how does that happen because you can't take your child to an emergency room and get them treated without parents a parent's permission but yet a school can counsel a child without the parent's permission how does that work How does that work and this is the problem here is that too much too much it's too much parents have the right to know what's going on with their children do we need to put some safeguards in place yes I would agree but no teacher should be counseling a student referring them for mental health services what how does that work telling them well you're exploring your gender well you know maybe you should go see this person or go go over here or go do this without the parents knowing.

637
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
How does that happen?

638
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
How does that happen?

639
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:39.000
But it happens in school, but it's okay because the child is supposed to be safe.

640
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
It's a safe environment.

641
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:55.000
We've had, I don't know how many times we have had hearings where people have said to us, a child's brain doesn't develop until the age of 25.

642
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Okay.

643
01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:08.000
But yet you are going to trust a 10-year-old, a 12-year-old, a 15-year-old to start making decisions like this on their own?

644
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:20.000
With support from a teacher who, by the way, has no relation to that child other than the fact that they are a teacher.

645
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:27.500
Are you now going to say, okay, you're going to be responsible for what happens?

646
01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:31.000
Do teachers want to assume that responsibility?

647
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Do districts want to now assume that responsibility?

648
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Is that what we want to have happen?

649
01:12:39.000 --> 01:13:08.000
a lot of things i'm sorry i i don't mean to attack you and i hope you don't think i'm attacking you but this is an extremely complicated issue this is not an easy thing to to think about but i also think we need to think about the role of schools in in state of New Hampshire.

650
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Do we want them to assume this responsibility?

651
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:22.000
If we do, we better put some safeguards in there for the parents, for the kids, and for the schools.

652
01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Because right now there are none.

653
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.500
What safeguards are in place?

654
01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:57.500
So if a teacher counsels a student on their gender dysphoria and the parents find out can they sue the school can they individually sue that teacher for interfering in the parent child relationship do schools want to accept that liability i can't answer that question but at some point we are going to have to tackle with that issue.

655
01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.500
Thank you.

656
01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:01.500
Representative DeSimone.

657
01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:03.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

658
01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:07.500
In some respects I absolutely agree with senator.

659
01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:16.000
But I'm also thinking about when 100 years ago I was in school, we had guidance counselors.

660
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.500
They still have guidance counselors.

661
01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:29.500
And those counselors were to guide us, hopefully in the right direction, when we had an issue, be it academic or social.

662
01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:37.000
Teachers are expected to teach and guide a child through their academics and their behavior.

663
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:53.000
And when the teachers see that a child's behavior is conducive of issues at home they are mandated reporters and shall report When most parents who are good parents get this information.

664
01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:02.500
Then the school and the parents get to treat that child so they become happy, well-adjusted members of society.

665
01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:18.500
But then you have the child who comes to a guidance counselor, a teacher, a secretary in the office, and says, I don't know what I'm going to do with my life.

666
01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:21.500
I have nobody to turn to.

667
01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:27.500
I cannot tell my parents I'm afraid to go to my parents.

668
01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:33.000
I don't have any family members that I can go to.

669
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:39.000
I cannot tell my parents I'm afraid to go to my parents.

670
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:52.500
I don't have any family members that I can go to to tell them that I have a transgender question or that I'm gay or I'm lesbian.

671
01:15:52.500 --> 01:16:00.000
I cannot tell them I don't know how they're going to react, please help me.

672
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.500
Is it the school's story to tell?

673
01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:07.500
Is it the guidance counselor's story to tell?

674
01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:36.500
Or is it the guidance counselor's responsibility to guide the child until the child feels safe do we want to put kids in a position where they now no longer have that guidance counselor to go to because they know the guidance council is going to tell the parents then what happens then the suicide rate goes up.

675
01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:41.500
So just so we're aware, I also received an email.

676
01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:48.500
I reached out to the Attorney General's office to have them look over this.

677
01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:57.000
And they said that someone was going to be here, and I don't know if they are.

678
01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Yes, you are?

679
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Yes, he's here.

680
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:28.500
I'd like to have you, if you don't mind, come and and give us some because everyone didn't receive the email so just so that everyone's clear on what we did thank you and your attorney lock yes there we go yes i'm attorney lock i'm assistant attorney Sean Locke with the Department of Justice.

681
01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:42.500
I direct the Civil Rights Unit there, a role I've held for about three years now, and before that I was a prosecutor in the Criminal Justice Bureau.

682
01:17:42.500 --> 01:20:26.000
I was asked to kind of provide some input on behalf of the department, and it's important to note the department doesn't take a position on the overarching legislation, but looked at this to see if there are potential conflicts with the state's anti-discrimination laws or potential federal law and so with respect to the state's anti-discrimination laws in 2019 the state adopted a provision that prohibited discrimination in public education it provides that no person shall be excluded from participation in denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination in public schools because of their among other things sex gender identity and sexual orientation and our one of the concerns we saw here was that certain portions of the current version of the bill specifically require school staff to promptly notify a student's parents about the student's gender expression or identity should the school or school employee initiate investigator find the need for any action by school authorities related to the student policies governing gender identity expression or identity and so it could be construed to require for lack of a better word school staff to out students against the students wishes where you have that student who expresses a fear that their parents find out or their or their guardians find out because they don't know whether and it may just be they don't know how their parents are going to react their parents may be very supportive but that's not necessarily the thought process of a 14 year old or a 12 year old they may be afraid of that reaction they may not be ready to express that to their parents and they're looking for some support and guidance in answering that particular question but this if the student were to approach a staff person about this or seek the protection of the district or the school's transgender kind of anti-discrimination policy, their parents would have to be told at that point.

683
01:20:26.000 --> 01:23:28.500
And so the concern here in the conflict or the potential conflict we see with the anti-discrimination law arises because the language specifically targets students based upon their gender identity or expression on their students which may deny those students the benefits of those particular policies designed to protect them it also there are other sections that dealt with student extracurricular activities so if a student were to go to a meeting of I apologize I don't know if they're still called this but when I was in high school they're called gay straight alliances um to go to a meeting of that where they might seek kind of support from their peers or friends that that may have to be reported to their parents and again lead to them being kind of outed to their parents um and even in with respect to federal law federal courts have recognized that laws that target or classify individuals based on their sexual orientation or being trends transgender constitute as sex-based classifications and if and when um the legislation requires schools to inform parents that the student is seeking the protections afforded to them by the school's policies protecting transgender students it's only going to impact transgender students it's not going to impact non-transgender students it's also kind of important to note in this particular area with respect to the potential liability the u.s department of justice has been made sent a we'll call a dear colleague expressing its It's intent to pursue litigation on behalf of LGBTQ minors and youth, directed more specifically, probably more specifically, other laws like those in Alabama and policies other states have adopted with respect to care for transgender youth, but they are looking very closely at issues that might exclude or prevent trans lgbtq youth from being fully protected by the law we also just noted some concerns around privacy here and there's case law where in circumstances where essentially public officials and most in one context it was a police department threatened to out a student or out a teenager the teenager later later committed suicide and the municipality was liable for that person's death and ended up settling.

684
01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:41.500
It's a concern here where again, what a student may do in the face of that fear of being outed could expose the schools to liability.

685
01:23:41.500 --> 01:24:19.500
And that's kind of a summary here of the email i sent i'm happy to provide that to the rest of the committee as well and take questions thank you senator carson thank you madam chair um i also i read your your email and i'd like to point out that and you talked about a young man um who was in the process of being arrested and they threatened to out him to his grandfather.

686
01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:24.500
This person was 18 years old and legally an adult.

687
01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:32.000
So I think that there's we need to realize that there is a difference here.

688
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Someone who's 18, they're legally adult.

689
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.500
They're they're responsible for themselves.

690
01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:41.500
They can do whatever they want to do.

691
01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:47.500
But we're talking specifically about people that are younger than the ages.

692
01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:51.000
I would like to add some clarification.

693
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.500
You had talked about clubs and parents being informed.

694
01:24:55.500 --> 01:25:00.500
This wasn't just specifically dealing with one type of club.

695
01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:03.000
This was affecting all students.

696
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:16.500
So you're not looking at one particular group of students that are going to be treated differently than every other student, any other student in a school.

697
01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:21.000
All students are going to be treated the same.

698
01:25:21.000 --> 01:26:00.500
all parents are going to be notified of the clubs that their children belong to so can you can you clarify that for me because to me that sounds like you're misrepresenting what we had uh in the bill so i think the concern there arises that specifically lgbtq identified students might not feel safe or able to avail themselves of those programs or particular clubs without exposing themselves to the risk of being essentially outed to their families.

699
01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:19.500
And so in that way, those particular students may be being denied the benefits of being able to participate in those groups that may not be, that may be available to those who do not identify as LGBTQ.

700
01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:22.000
That's where the concern arises.

701
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:54.500
And the same thing you know and but at the same time the primary concern is that there are specific provisions in the senate version of the bill that do specifically identify gender identity and expression as a basis to have to make reports to parents and so that you know that specifically identifies that particular group of students as opposed to any other group.

702
01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:58.000
May I follow up with another question?

703
01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Thank you.

704
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:06.000
One of the questions that I had concerned school personnel offering counseling.

705
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:18.000
People that do not have mental health backgrounds, they have a degree in education, they're not licensed as counselors, except perhaps a guidance counselor.

706
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:32.000
And I'm really not sure whether or not they have any kind of license to be a school guidance counselor and what kind of educational background they have.

707
01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:51.500
because much like representative de simone when i went to school our guidance counselors were there to just give us counseling on our plans moving forward from high school, whether it's going on to college, going on to work.

708
01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:56.500
They did not get involved in personal issues with students.

709
01:27:56.500 --> 01:28:15.500
That obviously has changed, and I do think it's going to be worthwhile for the legislature to look into the qualifications of both teachers and guidance counselors and school administrators if they are going to assume this role.

710
01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:38.000
because you want to make sure that if a child is going to be receiving mental health counseling, you want to make sure that they're getting counseling from someone who has the appropriate educational background, not someone who's just going to, okay, yes, I understand.

711
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:49.500
Someone who's really going to try to help the student get through this process because obviously you're not going to inform the parents.

712
01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:59.500
So the parents are not going to get the opportunity to try to help their own child through this process.

713
01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:15.000
But I want to know what law enables a minor to invoke protections of the government and to do so with the assistance of the government keeping parents from finding out.

714
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
So there is necessary.

715
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:53.000
So, you know, if there were a situation where a parent were to come to the school and explicitly ask, has my child sought, you know, gender affirming kind of care or something like that from the school, I don't know that there is a law that would say the school can't answer that question or would be, you know, prohibited or would have a basis to refuse to answer that question.

716
01:29:53.000 --> 01:31:39.500
The issue is more, I think, my understanding having kind of talked to kind of both LGBTQ advocates and school advocates is the idea behind some of the policies in place is to kind of support the students as they prepare to come out to their parents and not kind of have the kind of this traumatic forcible outing process, but to have the student come out on their own terms when they're able to do so and feel like they are in a safe kind of mental place to be able to do that um so so I guess to answer your question directly no there isn't necessarily a law I think that I can think of that would say a school has you know absolutely cannot and that's the balancing here and I think in the section you referenced about the individual who committed suicide part of what that case is there for is that this case has been used by advocacy groups to sue school districts dealing with minors in these circumstances and that has been those have resulted in settlements against those districts but there is kind of an unsettled area of law about the privacy kind of balancing the privacy of a minor versus the interests the parents.

717
01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:48.500
And it's not to say that there isn't an interest that the parents have in knowing this information.

718
01:31:48.500 --> 01:32:03.500
For example, if the student was engaging in dangerous behavior, there wasn't any way to explain that without essentially outing the student, there may be an obligation to do so.

719
01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:29.000
But there's a difference, I think, in terms of a student just going to a gay-straight alliance and then having their parents told, and a student who might be kind of engaging in, you know, far more dangerous behavior that the school becomes aware of or that happens at the school.

720
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:39.000
And then this has to be kind of as part of the context of why this information came to light.

721
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

722
01:32:41.000 --> 01:33:20.000
um do you know if the schools if schools if they engage in this kind of counseling with students are they required to keep records as part of the students um i guess packet of information i don't know off the top of my head that piece of information um certainly you know there may be a risk to schools if you had completely unlicensed individuals providing mental health counseling there could be other types of Thank you.

723
01:33:20.000 --> 01:34:33.500
of my head that piece of information um certainly you know there may be risk to schools if you had completely unlicensed individuals providing mental health counseling there could be other types of risks that are at play and some of that may come into what the definition of counseling is but i would imagine you know if they were seeing a kind of a if there's a psychiatrist or a kind of a licensed counselor in the school there would be records being kept of those conversations just as part of the course of care that would be my assumption but i don't know may follow up one one last question thank you would those records be subject to 91a by the parents because the parents i mean on 91a the right to know um the parents have an interest in what's happening with their children.

724
01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:38.500
This is their school record, and they want to see.

725
01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:53.500
Do you see any impediment right now to a parent saying, I want to know if my child has received this counseling in school, and I would like the records?

726
01:34:53.500 --> 01:35:00.000
Would they have to go ahead and file 91A requests for those records?

727
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:51.500
I guess part of me is, and part of why I made the face when you said 91a is i don't know if i would proceed under 91a if i were a parent in that circumstance there's federal laws that would allow parent that should allow parents access to their child's educational record so not that i do this in my career but if i were advising a parent i would probably suggest they avail themselves of that and go through the 91a process but i think there are ways to get access to those records if they were a parent seeking them.

728
01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:53.500
Thank you.

729
01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:55.500
Senator Whitley.

730
01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:57.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

731
01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:00.500
Thank you for taking our questions.

732
01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:14.000
My understanding would be, I think you're correct, it would be like under HIPAA or FERPA, you know, there's a lot of different ways to access records.

733
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.500
And I think it is this balance of privacy.

734
01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:26.500
So, but my, well, there's two things that I would be interested in hearing from you.

735
01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:35.500
One, the sort of line that Senator Carson raised about, of course, we want people, I fully agree.

736
01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:46.000
If there's mental health treatment being provided in the schools, I fully agree it should be by people who are credentialed.

737
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Absolutely.

738
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:56.500
But what I hear you saying is that it may not always involve mental health treatment, right?

739
01:36:56.500 --> 01:37:07.000
Because just because someone has decided they are non-binary or transgender or perhaps exploring their sexuality, they don't need treatment, right?

740
01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
That's just their identity.

741
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:14.000
They perhaps need someone to have a discussion Thank you.

742
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.000
exploring their sexuality, they don't need treatment, right?

743
01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
That's just their identity.

744
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:24.500
They perhaps need someone to have a discussion with.

745
01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:34.000
But I think we do need to be careful that just because someone is LGBTQ, they don't need treatment.

746
01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:49.500
But my question to you is that this is a legal question, and I apologize for putting you on the spot, but this bill only lays out the rights of parents.

747
01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:59.000
And some of those rights are already in other places, be it in practice or constitutional rights or statute.

748
01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:06.500
I think we heard a lot of testimony that some of these rights already exist.

749
01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:29.500
So do you have any concerns that because those already exist, they're being restated here, and that there's no mention of the interest or rights of children, that somehow by restating them in this, we are elevating the rights of parents over the rights of children?

750
01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:33.500
Do you have any legal concerns about that?

751
01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:49.000
part yes part no um i I think, you know, one, I think there's an important balancing here, obviously, between the rights of the parents and the rights of the child.

752
01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.500
Like, you know, it's not to say parents' rights don't matter.

753
01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:58.500
It's not to say children's rights don't matter.

754
01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:00.500
It's finding that balance.

755
01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:07.500
But I think, you know, in terms of statutory interpretation, it does create complexity.

756
01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:39.000
If you have two statutes saying the same thing and there are differences between the two, that might be something that the New Hampshire Supreme Court looks to to say, well, we have to, because this law is, whether it's more specific, whether it is more recent, whether it is more detailed, we have to look to that as the touchstone for interpretation.

757
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:56.000
And so we're going to not necessarily consider these other laws, because they're going to try to harm, but they are generally going to try to harmonize the laws together as best they can.

758
01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:20.500
And so if that means that, you know, other statutes that might have a little bit more, like might have some balancing that maybe skews more in favor of the child, then maybe to harmonize those that they look to protecting the child's rights more maybe than the parents.

759
01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:35.500
But if there isn't, or if there's a law that's, you know, more protective of the parents' rights, depending on the circumstances, they might skew it more in that direction.

760
01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:46.000
It would be hard to kind of really get into the details without having a specific kind of comparison point there.

761
01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Follow up?

762
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Thank you.

763
01:40:50.000 --> 01:41:08.000
So the sort of related question is that, you know, this idea of balancing interests, of course, you know, parents have these fundamental rights, you know, and, but also children have, children have rights too, right?

764
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.500
To be safe, you know, other rights.

765
01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:19.500
And so, you know, I guess that I'm concerned with this sort of off-balance approach, right?

766
01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:29.500
If we're only talking about parents' rights and not even mentioning children's rights, that's the balance that I'm concerned about.

767
01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:34.500
And I'm wondering if you have any concerns about that.

768
01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:53.000
I don't know if you read the the report from the Massachusetts Office of Child Advocate in the Harmony Montgomery case, which said that Massachusetts essentially elevated the rights of parents over the right of Harmony Montgomery.

769
01:41:53.000 --> 01:42:18.500
and that was of course a very problematic situation that resulted in who knows what right and so do you have any concerns that you know this is sort of you know we have a house And that was, of course, a very problematic situation that resulted in who knows what.

770
01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:20.500
Right.

771
01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:49.000
And so do you have any concerns that, you know, this is sort of, you know, we have a House version, we have a Senate version that, you know, either version would upset that balance to elevate the right of a parent over the right of a child who could potentially be subject to abuse and neglect?

772
01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:54.500
I think, you know, the balance is key in these circumstances.

773
01:42:54.500 --> 01:43:15.500
I'm going to, you know, Because the idea is the child who is, you know, kind of a teenager questioning coming out, trying to decide whether to come out, they could have the most supportive parents in the world in that process.

774
01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:24.500
But that doesn't maybe eliminate the fear because, you know, they just don't, it's different when it's you.

775
01:43:24.500 --> 01:43:37.000
It's different when it is you making that choice and what might happen as a result, what in your life might change as a result.

776
01:43:37.000 --> 01:44:11.500
And so the concern here with that balance is making sure to kind of protect that child from being kind of put through what could be, you know, even with support parents, a very traumatic experience of kind of uncertainty and letting them kind of come to terms and be able to prepare to do that on their own and when they are ready and able to do that.

777
01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:16.500
And so that's, I think, the concern with the balance.

778
01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:19.000
There's finding that right balance.

779
01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.500
And it's a difficult balance to find.

780
01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:26.000
I'm not going to pretend it's not.

781
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:49.500
But it's that important balance and kind of a process that might force a child, even in the rare circumstance through a very difficult process that leads to a bad result, is going to be, I mean, it's a bad result at the end of the day.

782
01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:51.500
There's no preventing that.

783
01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:53.500
Senator Gannon.

784
01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:57.000
Thanks, Attorney Locke, for taking my question.

785
01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Senator Carson asked a lot of what I wanted to say, so I'll be really brief.

786
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:13.500
You talked about a 14-year hypothetical 14-year-old, and you said, you know, their thought process developed yet.

787
01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:20.500
So you're saying legally they lack capacity to do a lot of things, correct?

788
01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:30.000
But in any sense, anyone under the age of 18 is going to have a lot of legal capacity.

789
01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Thank you.

790
01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:39.000
So the parents are responsible for the health, education, welfare of that child, right?

791
01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
They're the family unit.

792
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.000
The primary thing is parents, correct?

793
01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Legally.

794
01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Yes.

795
01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Okay.

796
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:58.500
And so if you keep information from them, so the state or schools is for liability reasons.

797
01:45:58.500 --> 01:46:03.500
Something happens to my child, they harm themselves at home.

798
01:46:03.500 --> 01:47:54.500
And I was totally unaware that they were having this issue or problem that they questioned their sexuality whatever the case is you've kept that from me is not the state and the school going to have huge liability issues for not informing the parents well i think that's where i mentioned like there may be circumstances where you do have to disclose that information it's not you know you can't necessarily have this kind of code of silence you have like there may be circumstances where if the child like if the child is engaging in dangerous behavior or if they're the target of bullying and harassment by other students you may have to explain to the parents why that's happening even if the child doesn't want you to do that i mean certainly plenty of kids on this player or not player and athletic fields anything like that they'll call each other names whether it's founded or not but if you know if you know there's it's putting the student at risk yes you may have to kind of expound the student whether they want that or not to make sure they're adequately protected so just one last follow-up so continuing on senator carson's theme of certain educators certain officials uh teachers whoever really don't have a mental health background.

799
01:47:54.500 --> 01:48:10.000
And so my 13-year-old, she probably, between coaches, dance teachers, counselors at the school, anything, she's seeing 15 to 20 people per year who are going to be teaching, instructing her.

800
01:48:10.000 --> 01:49:33.000
They're there for a very short period of time, seven, eight months, then we're going on to the next 15 or 20 are you not afraid that you're taking away the parental main function of i know the kid i've been there i've been there with them from birth i want the best for them and if you these people who don't have a background in mental health education are making these decisions of what when to come forward when the kid comes to them don't you think they always need to come forward unless there's a danger and that's why we have dcyf a mandated reporter well i think the issue here though is it's facilitating the child to be able to come forward it's not the teacher that decides i mean this would be to flip that around a little bit i mean this is the legislature deciding when the parent gets to find out and when the child has to disclose this information.

801
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:58.000
But in this context, it's, you know, the teacher's facility, the idea would be the teacher, the guidance counselor, whoever it is working with this child is facilitating them to be able to do that when they are able to, when they feel safe, comfortable, and ready to do so.

802
01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:12.500
It's not, you know, them making the choice unilaterally to say, this is when you're going to tell, like, you're telling your parents next week, or I'm telling them.

803
01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:24.000
It's, you know, I'm going to give you the tools to be able to prepare yourself to do this and have this conversation.

804
01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:28.500
Because if they're afraid, I might end up homeless.

805
01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:38.000
And maybe let's make sure there are services, like our social worker has services in place if that happens.

806
01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:45.500
So you don't end up on the street, you end up in a supportive environment.

807
01:50:45.500 --> 01:51:32.000
And it may be an unfounded fear at the end of the day and i will you know fully acknowledge that thank you senator carson thank you madam chair i think attorney lock you really kind of put your finger on what i am concerned about one of the things anyway is that a child is receiving medical treatment whether it's met its mental health counseling without the permission One of the things, anyway, is that a child is receiving medical treatment, whether it's mental health counseling, without the permission of the parents.

808
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:38.000
They're in school to be educated, not to receive mental health counseling.

809
01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:43.000
That's not the purpose of sending the child to school.

810
01:51:43.000 --> 01:53:35.500
And so when a child receives mental health counseling, you don't know anything about the type of counseling you don't know if the counselor is adequately that do they have the education the certificate everything that they need in order to be a good counselor for your child you are kept literally in the dark you have no idea and that I find very problematic that the parents just you just feel well the school knows better than the parent and that is not the case your child is receiving medical treatment mental health counseling and the parents don't even know they have no idea and there's no obligation to inform the parents much like if like I said your child was in the school they fell down and they needed stitches they would take your child to the hospital and you'd have to go there and give your permission for that to happen but with schools it seemed that it's in this instance it's very very different and it really shouldn't be it really shouldn't be if my child is going to get mental health counseling at school i want to make sure that that person is qualified to do that type of counseling with my child but because no one is being told i don't get to make that decision for my child.

811
01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:41.500
I don't get to be involved in that process with my child.

812
01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:43.500
It's happening during school.

813
01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:53.000
So it's basically saying the schoolhouse doors are closed, you stay over there, and we're going to stay here.

814
01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:58.500
And that's not the way it was ever intended to be.

815
01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:01.500
I appreciate the concern you've expressed.

816
01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:20.500
Part of, I guess, the way I would maybe question some of that assessment is I'm not sure, you know, if a student say, I'm questioning my sexual orientation, they're really getting mental health counseling at the end.

817
01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:25.000
I mean, is that, what is being treated there?

818
01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:29.500
What is the psychiatric or medical condition being treated?

819
01:54:29.500 --> 01:56:38.000
If a student says, look, I'm questioning my sexuality, I'm worried about coming out to my parents because of their reaction, it may be counseling in a very broad sense in the way that we go to each other to seek life advice about, you know, I have to make an employment decision or I have to make a difficult decision in my life, but is it mental health counseling at the end of the day in the sense of this person is getting psychiatric services that would require medical care i it's i just kind of been struggling a little bit with that comparison thank you madam chair i disagree with your analogy about going to a friend um you know your friend they don't probably have a background in mental health you just they know me they you know hey i'm struggling with this this is what's going on what do you think but you have to think about the dynamic between a child and a teacher or a counselor at school very very very different dynamic um i'm good well they're a teacher they're they're here there's a mental health counselor or a guidance counselor they're up here they're in a position of power over that student whereas if you're just talking to a friend you don't have that type of power dynamic it doesn't exist and you get to choose so my concern here is we are now treading into an area that we just aren't prepared to deal with I don't know.

820
01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:48.000
So my concern here is we are now treading into an area that we just aren't prepared to deal with.

821
01:56:48.000 --> 01:57:00.500
Our schools certainly are not if they're offering this type of counseling, because even you had mentioned that to help them prepare to come out.

822
01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:02.500
That is a process.

823
01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:18.000
that is not a one and done where I'm going to sit with somebody for, you know, a half an hour with a friend and I'm going to talk about this.

824
01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.500
This is going to be a process.

825
01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:26.000
That is actual counseling on how to do this.

826
01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:32.000
So I think the schools are putting themselves at a huge liability.

827
01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:40.000
I think the teachers are putting themselves at a huge liability, as well as the administrators.

828
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:51.500
And I think we really need to take a step back and we need to look at what is actually going on here.

829
01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:58.000
Because as I said, the schoolhouse doors are closed, parents are over there.

830
01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:03.500
And is it that is that the role for the schools?

831
01:58:03.500 --> 01:58:06.500
Schools are creatures of a community.

832
01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:08.500
They've created the schools.

833
01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:14.000
Is that what they want to go on in their schools?

834
01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:17.000
And no one's asked the questions.

835
01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.500
Nobody has talked about it.

836
01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:26.000
So this bill just basically says, these are the rights of the parents.

837
01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:29.500
Parents are legally responsible to their children.

838
01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:38.000
Parents can be arrested if they abandon their children, can be arrested if they neglect their children.

839
01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:41.500
But why are we picking and choosing?

840
01:58:41.500 --> 01:58:47.500
And it's not about elevating the rights of one over the other.

841
01:58:47.500 --> 01:59:13.000
We have recognized here in the state that when it comes to these very, very difficult decisions, unlike Massachusetts in the Harmony Montgomery case, we have elevated that we have to do what's in the best right of the children in these types of very, very difficult abuse and neglect cases.

842
01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:17.500
But we're not talking about abuse and neglect cases.

843
01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:21.000
That's not what we're talking about here.

844
01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:29.000
We're talking about parents who put their kids on a school bus to go to school.

845
01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:36.000
And do they have a right to know what's going on in that school?

846
01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:42.500
Because I think we all know kids aren't going to, kids are kids.

847
01:59:42.500 --> 01:59:44.500
We were all there.

848
01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:50.000
We never told our parents everything that was happening in school.

849
01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
We just don't.

850
01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:57.000
But the fundamental question is, do parents have the right?

851
01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:07.500
And then beyond that, okay, if the schools are going to assume this role, we need to put parameters around that.

852
02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:10.500
So that's where the Senate is.

853
02:00:10.500 --> 02:00:59.000
And I think to answer the question of do they have the right, I think there are, like as I mentioned earlier, there are statutes and laws that would allow parents access to this information when they seek it the difference here is this puts the affirmative obligation on the school to inform the parents thank you thank you thank you very much i appreciate it um so to go on to the next um thing that we heard a lot from the domestic violence advocates, New Hampshire Legal Assistance and New Hampshire Domestic, New Hampshire Coalition.

854
02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
Thank you.

855
02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:05.500
We just know it as the coalition, Madam Chair.

856
02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:07.500
I know.

857
02:01:07.500 --> 02:01:09.500
Sorry.

858
02:01:09.500 --> 02:01:13.000
That brought up some very good points.

859
02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:26.000
One being that an abuser could go into the school, request the records, and with nothing redacted, that would have the victim's current address on it.

860
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:35.500
I know when I went through it and the courts even redacted my address so he couldn't find me.

861
02:01:35.500 --> 02:01:42.000
This really startles me because we don't want to do any more harm.

862
02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:49.500
And also it states that both parents can be there for events at the school.

863
02:01:49.500 --> 02:01:55.000
How does this protect the person that has the restraining order?

864
02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:59.000
Is she not allowed to go or he?

865
02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Are they not allowed to go?

866
02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.500
I'm going to be honest.

867
02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:11.000
I feel like a lot of issues were brought up after the fact.

868
02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:39.500
It would have been nice to have these beforehand so we could fully vet them because there's just I don't see any way I can support this because we would have to amend so much stuff to try to make this safe for people that I think it's going to take more time than what we have.

869
02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:41.500
Senator Carson.

870
02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:43.500
Thank you Madam Chair.

871
02:02:43.500 --> 02:02:53.500
Thank you for articulating what I going to, is the fact that we didn't have testimony to any of this.

872
02:02:53.500 --> 02:02:58.000
And if we had, we could have done that.

873
02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:02.000
We would have been able to do that.

874
02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:29.000
So I'm very disappointed in these organizations that are out there that work with victims of domestic violence, why they didn't come to the table, why they didn't come to the hearing and talk about this issue, because we certainly could have dealt with it when the Senate was in possession with the bill.

875
02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Thank you.

876
02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Senator Whitley?

877
02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:41.500
Yeah, well, I just, I mean, to be fair, the Senate amended the bill in executive session.

878
02:03:41.500 --> 02:03:51.000
So we didn't have a hearing on the version that gave many, many people pause about the LGBTQ issues.

879
02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.000
We just didn't have a hearing on that.

880
02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:01.000
So I just want to be a little bit fair about that.

881
02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:09.500
They, you know, there wasn't an opportunity to publicly provide input because it was an executive session.

882
02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:14.500
So that's why they had to come to us after.

883
02:04:14.500 --> 02:04:30.500
And I think there were also some changes that we made on the floor to try to fix it that have raised other issues that, you know, the coalition is now addressing.

884
02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:43.000
So I just wanted to be a little bit fair about that, that, you know, the legislative process is complicated and we are making changes.

885
02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:50.000
And so as those changes are happening, you know, these groups have to respond.

886
02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:53.000
And I think they've responded appropriately.

887
02:04:53.000 --> 02:05:12.000
And I know that when the House sent it over to the Senate, we sent what was already in statute because but we wanted them to have one place where they could find what was already in statute.

888
02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
Right.

889
02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:18.500
As far as the rights that are already there.

890
02:05:18.500 --> 02:05:28.000
But I just don't I I honestly think that this is just going to need a lot more work.

891
02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:37.000
And I mean, I think that's going to be something that can be worked on over the summer.

892
02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:43.000
But I just, I cannot agree to this in its present form.

893
02:05:43.000 --> 02:06:17.000
And to no fault of anyone, we did get all this information afterwards because of the way the process goes but i i just i can't so um i don't know if you guys want to see to the house position for what is already in statute but um yeah this is the conversation yeah so do we want to take um Senator, you have a 3 o'clock.

894
02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Yeah, I have a 3 o'clock.

895
02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:27.000
How long do you think you guys will need to take a little break?

896
02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.500
Yeah, you can recess until.

897
02:06:29.500 --> 02:06:31.500
I can't.

898
02:06:31.500 --> 02:06:33.500
Oh, yeah.

899
02:06:33.500 --> 02:06:35.500
Recess.

900
02:06:35.500 --> 02:06:38.000
We can take a break.

901
02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:49.500
No, no, you need to recess because if you, if we say, okay, and we'll meet at a different, you need 24-hour notice.

902
02:06:49.500 --> 02:06:51.500
Right.

903
02:06:51.500 --> 02:07:08.000
So if we recess for, you know, beginning at 3 o'clock for 45 minutes until, you know, whenever for 45 minutes, I'll go, we'll come back, and then we can get back together.

904
02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Okay, because I was told not to use the word recess unless I'm recessing to a different date and time.

905
02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:25.000
So I'm going to say we're going to take a break until 3 45.

906
02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Is that?

907
02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.500
Yeah, that should be okay.

908
02:07:29.500 --> 02:07:31.500
Yes.

909
02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:33.500
Yes.

910
02:07:33.500 --> 02:07:42.500
So if we do nothing, are we then saying to parents that schools can keep secrets from you?

911
02:07:42.500 --> 02:08:03.500
No, I think we're saying to parents that we want to make sure we do it right because that's what's in the best interest of their children and to the victims of domestic violence, what's in the best interest of their safety.

912
02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:10.500
Can I, I just, I mean, I want parents to understand they have rights.

913
02:08:10.500 --> 02:08:18.000
That's why when we sent it over from the house, those were already in statute.

914
02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.500
We took out the penalties.

915
02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:25.000
We brought it over just what was in statute.

916
02:08:25.000 --> 02:09:01.000
so it could be in one place for parents to easily find because I think they're having a problem with um knowing where to look I mean if you're not up here doing this job it's very hard to know where to go to look for things you know so that's you know what we did but and and whatever, I lost my train of thought, I'm so sorry, but Senator Whitley.

917
02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:25.000
So, I mean, I think on the House version, there were we had heard from the department, the DCYF, Joe Ripsom had sent the Judiciary Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee, a letter about the House version saying that there were some problems on the abuse and neglect side.

918
02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:36.500
So I just wanted you to know that we had heard that it would interfere with their authority to do abuse and neglect.

919
02:09:36.500 --> 02:09:41.000
And then also the House version had criminal penalties.

920
02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:48.000
I thought we took those criminal penalties out because that was not the intent.

921
02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:53.000
I did not intend to send anything with criminal penalties.

922
02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:56.000
So we'll come back at 345.

923
02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:02.500
We'll take a break and then come back and see where we are.

924
02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:04.500
Thank you.

925
02:10:04.500 --> 02:10:06.500
Thank you.

926
02:10:06.500 --> 02:10:16.500
We'll have to put in a bill requiring schools if they're going to do this type of council Thank you.

927
02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:18.500
Thank you.

928
02:10:18.500 --> 02:10:20.500
Thank you.

929
02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:22.500
Thank you.

930
02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:24.500
Thank you.

931
02:10:24.500 --> 02:10:26.500
Thank you.

932
02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:28.500
Thank you.

933
02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:30.500
Thank you.

934
02:10:30.500 --> 02:10:32.500
Thank you.

935
02:10:32.500 --> 02:10:34.500
Thank you.

936
02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:36.500
Thank you.

937
02:10:36.500 --> 02:10:38.500
Thank you.

938
02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:40.500
Thank you.

939
02:10:40.500 --> 02:10:42.500
Thank you.

940
02:10:42.500 --> 02:10:44.500
Thank you.

941
02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:46.500
Thank you.

942
02:10:46.500 --> 02:10:48.500
Thank you.

943
02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:50.500
Thank you.

944
02:10:50.500 --> 02:10:52.500
Thank you.

945
02:10:52.500 --> 02:10:54.500
Thank you.

946
02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:56.500
Thank you.

947
02:10:56.500 --> 02:10:58.500
Thank you.

948
02:10:58.500 --> 02:11:00.500
Thank you.

949
02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:02.500
Thank you.

950
02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:04.500
Thank you.

951
02:11:04.500 --> 02:11:06.500
Thank you.

952
02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:08.500
Thank you.

953
02:11:08.500 --> 02:11:10.500
Thank you.

954
02:11:10.500 --> 02:11:12.500
Thank you.

955
02:11:12.500 --> 02:11:14.500
Thank you.

956
02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:16.500
Thank you.

957
02:11:16.500 --> 02:11:18.500
Thank you.

958
02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:20.500
Thank you.

959
02:11:20.500 --> 02:11:22.500
Thank you.

960
02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:24.500
Thank you.

961
02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:26.500
Thank you.

962
02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:28.500
Thank you.

963
02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:30.500
Thank you.

964
02:11:30.500 --> 02:11:32.500
Thank you.

965
02:11:32.500 --> 02:11:34.500
Thank you.

966
02:11:34.500 --> 02:11:36.500
Thank you.

967
02:11:36.500 --> 02:11:38.500
Thank you.

968
02:11:38.500 --> 02:11:40.500
Thank you.

969
02:11:40.500 --> 02:11:42.500
Thank you.

970
02:11:42.500 --> 02:11:44.500
Thank you.

971
02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:46.500
Thank you.

972
02:11:46.500 --> 02:11:48.500
Thank you.

973
02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:50.500
Thank you.

974
02:11:50.500 --> 02:11:52.500
Thank you.

975
02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:54.500
Thank you.

976
02:11:54.500 --> 02:11:56.500
Thank you.

977
02:11:56.500 --> 02:11:58.500
Thank you.

978
02:11:58.500 --> 02:12:00.500
Thank you.

979
02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:02.500
Okay.

980
02:12:02.500 --> 02:12:04.500
So.

981
02:12:04.500 --> 02:12:12.000
I could offer the House version as amended, but amend it to remove the penalties.

982
02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:15.000
So where's the Senate on that?

983
02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:31.500
So I appreciate that the penalties are problematic, but when the House version came over to the Senate Judiciary Committee, we got a letter from Joe Ribson, the director of DCYF, saying that.

984
02:12:31.500 --> 02:12:33.500
And I apologize.

985
02:12:33.500 --> 02:12:37.500
I should have poured it during the break.

986
02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:52.500
But he essentially told us that the way that the House version is written, he's very concerned that it would interfere with DCYF's ability to conduct abuse and neglect investigations.

987
02:12:52.500 --> 02:13:10.000
And also we heard from the Office of Child Advocate, Maura, at the time that the way it was written could lead to the unintended consequences of sort of permitting abuse and neglect on children.

988
02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Okay.

989
02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:16.000
So you guys had time for a break.

990
02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
I didn't.

991
02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

992
02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
You didn't.

993
02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:25.000
I was in another committee conference.

994
02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
I'm sorry.

995
02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:33.500
So then I can't in good faith support this the way it is.

996
02:13:33.500 --> 02:13:35.500
I just can't.

997
02:13:35.500 --> 02:13:57.000
I would be, now that we have the information we need, I would be happy to prime sponsor this bill next year by, but fixing it with the information that we have, because I don't think we can fix it in two days.

998
02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:13.500
But if we have the summer to really, um, get it done, work with the sponsors of the bill and have the concerns, then I would be more than happy to do that.

999
02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:25.000
But I just can't do it this way because it just needs too much work to really try to fix in two days.

1000
02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:32.500
Well, Madam Chair, the only thing that I'm going to say is it's a shame.

1001
02:14:32.500 --> 02:14:52.500
It really and truly is a shame that all these groups that contacted us between the time that it was passed in the Senate up until now did not come to the table when the bill was in the Senate.

1002
02:14:52.500 --> 02:14:55.500
We could have addressed their issues.

1003
02:14:55.500 --> 02:14:58.000
We could have fixed everything.

1004
02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
And it's a shame.

1005
02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
It's shameful.

1006
02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:07.500
And it is not the way that people should be operating.

1007
02:15:07.500 --> 02:15:21.000
I don't know why they weren't paying attention, why they didn't see what we were doing, because everything we do is totally transparent in front of everyone.

1008
02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.500
Yes, there was an amendment.

1009
02:15:23.500 --> 02:15:28.000
The amendment was brought in during an executive session.

1010
02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:34.000
Anybody who knows me, we make those available to anybody who's there.

1011
02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
They can read them.

1012
02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:46.000
If they have questions, I allow people to ask questions, talk about their concerns about any amendment that comes forward.

1013
02:15:46.000 --> 02:16:21.500
People did not avail themselves of that and to submarine a good piece of legislation at this point because people did not take the initiative to be there at the table i think people really need to rethink how they're going to relate to the legislature on any particular issue going forward if you have a concern be there at the table we'd be more than happy to work with you.

1014
02:16:21.500 --> 02:16:28.500
But to do what has been done on this bill, I find extremely problematic.

1015
02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:43.500
And I understand that, but I think that the point is now that we have this information, and I just don't think in good faith that we can go forward.

1016
02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:54.500
I think that we take all of this into consideration, and then we come back with the proper bill in the fall.

1017
02:16:54.500 --> 02:16:57.000
And that's where we are.

1018
02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:03.500
Well, thank you very much, and thank you very much for your time.

1019
02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:05.500
Thank you.

1020
02:17:05.500 --> 02:17:07.500
Thank you.

1021
02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:09.500
Thank you.

1022
02:17:09.500 --> 02:17:11.500
Thank you.

1023
02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:13.500
Thank you.

1024
02:17:13.500 --> 02:17:15.500
Thank you.

1025
02:17:15.500 --> 02:17:17.500
Thank you.

1026
02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:19.500
Thank you.

1027
02:17:19.500 --> 02:17:21.500
Thank you.

1028
02:17:21.500 --> 02:17:23.500
Thank you.

1029
02:17:23.500 --> 02:17:25.500
Thank you.

1030
02:17:25.500 --> 02:17:27.500
Thank you.

1031
02:17:27.500 --> 02:17:29.500
Thank you.

1032
02:17:29.500 --> 02:18:22.500
it has four parts to it as we've seen number one no one should be required to receive a covid19 vaccination in order to receive benefits or services from dhhs we saw that reestablishes a special supplemental nutrition program for women infant and children's farmers market nutrition three requires the insurance commissioner to establish a pilot program for association health plans four directs the department of hhs to submit a state plan amendment to expand the postpartum coverage under medicaid the chair would like to recognize Senator Bradley to speak to item number four because he is I WANT TO READ THE RECOGNIZE OF THE MEDICAID.

1033
02:18:22.500 --> 02:18:32.500
CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO RECOGNIZE SENATOR BRADLEY TO SPEAK TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR BECAUSE HE HAS BROUGHT FORTH AN AMENDMENT.

1034
02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:36.500
IF I HAVE IT IN THE RIGHT SPOT.

1035
02:18:36.500 --> 02:18:38.500
DO I?

1036
02:18:38.500 --> 02:18:40.500
THANK YOU, MR.

1037
02:18:40.500 --> 02:18:42.500
CHAIR.

1038
02:18:42.500 --> 02:18:58.500
BASED ON THE CONVERSATION based on the conversation that we had yesterday and based on a further conversation I had after the committee conference with Representative Hunt, I am proposing this amendment.

1039
02:18:58.500 --> 02:19:14.000
I have not had the opportunity to talk to Representative Hunt about it because he's obviously not able to be here today, but I think it addresses many of his concerns.

1040
02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:21.500
And his concern was that no one's ever going to bid on a pilot program.

1041
02:19:21.500 --> 02:19:25.500
Why should we even go forward with it?

1042
02:19:25.500 --> 02:19:33.500
So what I am proposing is that the Department of Insurance publish a request for information.

1043
02:19:33.500 --> 02:19:45.500
That's a normal process that a department would go through to gauge the interest in establishing a pilot program for an associated health plan.

1044
02:19:45.500 --> 02:20:02.500
and then it's the rest of the language because if there is going to be a pilot program we need to protect state mandated coverages and all the other things that were in it.

1045
02:20:02.500 --> 02:20:09.500
A thousand participants comply with the AHP final rule, all that kind of stuff.

1046
02:20:09.500 --> 02:20:14.500
So it would have to be based on those criteria.

1047
02:20:14.500 --> 02:20:50.000
if there's no interest there's no we haven't the department hasn't had to jump through hoops to try be based on those criteria if there's no interest there's no um we haven't the department hasn't had to jump through hoops to try to put together a pilot program they put out a request for information gauge the interest we see what happens you've been all given a copy of that amendment.

1048
02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:54.000
Does anyone have any questions for the senator?

1049
02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
Thank you, Mr.

1050
02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Chair.

1051
02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:11.500
Senator Bradley, I'm a little slow on the uptake here, so I just want to roll back through my understanding of what we're trying to do here.

1052
02:21:11.500 --> 02:21:17.000
And if you would, just, uh, my ego won't be bruised.

1053
02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:36.000
I, I, I, when I think of an association health plan, I'm thinking of, uh, professionals that bond together, whether they be attorneys, whether they be engineers or whatever, they, they can form their own health insurance plan.

1054
02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:46.000
They can manage the collection of their own premiums, and they can manage the negotiation with the hospitals or whoever.

1055
02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:57.000
And so this is, if that's correct, then what you're proposing is a new player in the marketplace on the payer side.

1056
02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.500
Is that what we're doing?

1057
02:21:59.500 --> 02:22:03.000
We're increasing competition on the payer side?

1058
02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:08.000
That would be the hope of an associated health plan.

1059
02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:18.500
As Representative Hunt pointed out yesterday, we already have the MIWA statute, but nobody uses it because it's kind of prescriptive.

1060
02:22:18.500 --> 02:22:42.500
So the thought that Senator Rashardi, because it's her bill, had was to try a pilot program to see if on a small basis, a thousand lives, there would be interest in a pilot program to learn from it and see what, you know, see what might occur.

1061
02:22:42.500 --> 02:22:46.500
So it's as much information gathering as anything.

1062
02:22:46.500 --> 02:22:52.500
I think Chairman Hunt expressed his reservations, as we all heard, yesterday.

1063
02:22:52.500 --> 02:23:07.500
So having heard those, and a lot of it was, why should the department go through with doing something that, in his opinion, Representative Hunt's, nobody's likely to bid on.

1064
02:23:07.500 --> 02:23:09.500
Okay, I get that.

1065
02:23:09.500 --> 02:23:18.000
This means that the department would just put out an RFI and see what interest there is.

1066
02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:22.000
If there's no interest, then end of discussion.

1067
02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:32.000
if there is interest then we may want to come back next year with something that would formalize it again.

1068
02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:37.000
But this is just the very first step in the...

1069
02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
Follow up?

1070
02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Thank you, Mr.

1071
02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
Chair.

1072
02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:49.000
So as I'm looking at your amendment, I don't see any dollars.

1073
02:23:49.000 --> 02:24:01.500
So is this going to be cost-free to the state except for the intrinsic overhead associated with putting together an RFI and collecting the responses?

1074
02:24:01.500 --> 02:24:09.500
And you're assuming that is already in the budget and there's not additional money for that.

1075
02:24:09.500 --> 02:24:19.500
As I recall in the testimony, representative, they never asked for an appropriation to put together the full pilot program.

1076
02:24:19.500 --> 02:24:24.000
This would be even less than, so you're right.

1077
02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:29.000
There's no appropriation, should be no impact on state finances.

1078
02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
Thank you.

1079
02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:34.000
Any additional questions of the Senator?

1080
02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:42.000
I'm going to ask a question that I've asked in a few other committees of conference.

1081
02:24:42.000 --> 02:25:09.500
Given that this bill has four parts, the original House bill and then three additional add-ons, is it likely to be the Senate's will that it's all or nothing, or do you wish to vote on each item as a standalone, that in fact what passes could be one, two, or three of these items?

1082
02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:30.000
Certainly we have not caucused on that particular issue, and so I would not be ready to give you an answer quite yet would you like to take 10 minutes to do so and before they do you know what mr.

1083
02:25:30.000 --> 02:26:18.000
chair if I could make a suggestion why don't we go through each item and as I thought yesterday we actually were fairly close to a consensus if we're not then maybe we'll take a quick caucus i appreciate that let's try that representative edwards well this this plays off of what senator bradley just said i just wanted to revisit the dollar amount that we were talking about on wick um i i had said that I was willing to go as high as 30,000 and there was other ranges, 50 to a hundred thousand.

1084
02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:24.000
Um, and, and Lisa, I, I, I'm so horrible with last names.

1085
02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:29.000
Um, but I, I, and I'm hard at hearing too.

1086
02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.500
So this is just horrible.

1087
02:26:31.500 --> 02:26:34.000
I live in a hell.

1088
02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:46.500
Can we ask Lisa to come up and maybe talk to us about how much money they really need for the implementation of this program?

1089
02:26:46.500 --> 02:26:50.500
We can't, but I, as the chair can.

1090
02:26:50.500 --> 02:26:52.500
Ooh, that was awful.

1091
02:26:52.500 --> 02:27:18.500
Please come on up chairman pearson members of the community conference uh i have with me today for the record for myself i'm john williams director of legislative affairs for health and services and with me is lisa soroes director for the wick program for the uh the division of Health Services.

1092
02:27:18.500 --> 02:27:22.000
Representative Edwards, you may inquire or ask.

1093
02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Okay.

1094
02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:39.500
So my theory on this bill, rather than $300,000, what we really needed to do was to invest $30,000 because $30,000 would be the right amount to get the program started.

1095
02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:43.000
It would do three things at least.

1096
02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:50.500
It would let you show the feds the $10,000 good faith money on the personnel.

1097
02:27:50.500 --> 02:27:59.000
It would let you have money to do an RFI to start getting the farmers markets moving.

1098
02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:31.000
and it would allow you to print coupons that would be effective July 1 of 2023 that there would not be any money for July 1 2023 to September 30th because that's in the next budget year however if we got this bill passed this would be allowing the department to include it in the normal business, normal order of the governor's budget process.

1099
02:28:31.000 --> 02:29:10.500
and as a result, next spring, we'd just be looking at what the amount is that you think you would need for July 1 to September 30 of 23 and then the same period in 24 since it'd be a two-year budget okay what did I say there the the you disagree with no I agree that that that could work follow up I was just gonna ask if there anybody wanted to ask you questions about the $30,000.

1100
02:29:10.500 --> 02:29:18.000
Do you want me to clarify why there's that stark difference between $30,000 and $300,000?

1101
02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Please.

1102
02:29:20.000 --> 02:30:01.500
So the $300,000 includes the food dollars for the coupons, but it is not possible to get this program up and running for july 1st this year so that 270 000 isn't necessary today but for us to have the 30 000 admin dollars that will give us time to get the program up and running so july 1st of next summer we will need that 270 000 for food dollars to make it happen which which is what Representative Edwards has outlined.

1103
02:30:01.500 --> 02:30:03.500
I'm good with that.

1104
02:30:03.500 --> 02:30:10.000
I just wanted to make sure she was available to answer any questions.

1105
02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:16.500
So it sounds like $30,000 will do it to get the program going.

1106
02:30:16.500 --> 02:30:18.500
Yes.

1107
02:30:18.500 --> 02:30:23.000
The rest will be in the budget, we hope.

1108
02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
Yes.

1109
02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
Okay, good.

1110
02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
Yes.

1111
02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
Senator Gray.

1112
02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:36.500
Well, certainly $30,000 is what a minimum that I would accept.

1113
02:30:36.500 --> 02:30:48.500
But, you know, certainly I want to push the department, you know, to do what they can to provide fresh fruit, vegetables, and herbs.

1114
02:30:48.500 --> 02:30:53.000
I got them all right, I think, this time.

1115
02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.500
You know, to the individuals.

1116
02:30:55.500 --> 02:31:10.500
And I'm not necessarily thinking that, you know, part of the department has felt the pressure that we want to put on them to get this program up and running.

1117
02:31:10.500 --> 02:31:19.500
And if the scope of it were to expand some, then I don't know that $30,000 is sufficient.

1118
02:31:19.500 --> 02:31:31.500
Can you get this program into the theoretical phase so that when we have enough time to get something going, will $30,000 do it?

1119
02:31:31.500 --> 02:31:33.500
Yes.

1120
02:31:33.500 --> 02:31:35.500
Thank you.

1121
02:31:35.500 --> 02:31:37.500
Senator Bradley.

1122
02:31:37.500 --> 02:32:24.500
I, for one, can accept $30,000 if this gets us to yes on the overall package, because I suspect what will happen, Senator Whitley will ask Representative Edwards to sponsor a bill that she co-sponsors next year that Center that Representative Edwards will fold into House Bill 2 and we'll see it in the Senate if I may so we we're going to pass we're going to pass this bill that creates the program and so we don't even need another bill we'll just work together to make sure it is in the budget.

1123
02:32:24.500 --> 02:32:32.000
So hearing, and what I'm hearing is a commitment to put it in the budget.

1124
02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
Thank you.

1125
02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:37.000
Sounds like we have a plan.

1126
02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.500
Let's see, what we're doing.

1127
02:32:39.500 --> 02:32:42.500
So, straw vote, item number two.

1128
02:32:42.500 --> 02:32:44.500
Thank you.

1129
02:32:44.500 --> 02:32:46.500
Thank you.

1130
02:32:46.500 --> 02:32:49.000
I guess I'll go first.

1131
02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:52.000
I'm okay with your second item.

1132
02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
You okay with two?

1133
02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
I'm good with two.

1134
02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
Item two?

1135
02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.500
Okay, so that one's done.

1136
02:33:00.500 --> 02:33:03.500
And yes, that is at 30.

1137
02:33:03.500 --> 02:33:14.500
Item one clarifies no person shall be required to receive a COVID-19 vaccination in order to receive benefits or services from DHHS.

1138
02:33:14.500 --> 02:33:19.500
I seem to remember we were all good on that.

1139
02:33:19.500 --> 02:33:21.500
Is that true?

1140
02:33:21.500 --> 02:33:23.500
Yes.

1141
02:33:23.500 --> 02:33:25.500
Yes.

1142
02:33:25.500 --> 02:33:27.500
Yes.

1143
02:33:27.500 --> 02:33:29.500
Yes.

1144
02:33:29.500 --> 02:33:31.500
Yes.

1145
02:33:31.500 --> 02:33:33.500
Yes.

1146
02:33:33.500 --> 02:34:22.000
I hear at least eight votes good somebody's a little humor twice okay let's do four because we just talked about it um senator bradley's amendment um that is i see it as well i think it's four isn't it is it three oh okay sorry three and we like uh three as amended he does i'm sure he does senator gray you like yeah yeah i wouldn't say no okay i'm going to take that as a yes it's a not no and representative king and me yes we are three quarters of the way home.

1147
02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.500
Now let's talk about four.

1148
02:34:24.500 --> 02:34:27.500
Anybody wish to speak to four?

1149
02:34:27.500 --> 02:34:29.500
Please do.

1150
02:34:29.500 --> 02:34:59.500
Okay, so as I understand this line item, this refers to the bill that went through the House, through HHS, through Division III, and got passed by the entire House to go ahead and allow Medicaid reimbursement for postpartum services between two months and 12 months for those making somewhere between 130% of family poverty or federal poverty and 296%.

1151
02:34:59.500 --> 02:35:09.000
And that that would potentially affect 570 families, of which about 25% may actually take advantage of the benefit.

1152
02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:26.500
And I don't think there are any, this is the big one, I don't think there are any amendments that have been floated by anyone on this committee of conference to change that underlying bill.

1153
02:35:26.500 --> 02:35:31.000
Is that a correct assumption or a bad assumption?

1154
02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:39.000
So I don't even really know how this got in here because the House passed it.

1155
02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:44.000
Did the Senate not want to just vote on it?

1156
02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:56.500
We put this, we did, we put it in here because when the House passed it, they attached something that the Senate had already rejected.

1157
02:35:56.500 --> 02:35:58.500
Wow.

1158
02:35:58.500 --> 02:36:00.500
What was the number?

1159
02:36:00.500 --> 02:36:02.500
1210.

1160
02:36:02.500 --> 02:36:28.000
So, Representative Edwards, this became the bill that Representative Edwards what was the number well so representative edwards this became the bill that representative um lang's bill 1210 which was the right of conscience for vaccines got attached to we had voted that bill down two or three weeks ago, 12-10.

1161
02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:32.000
The House amendment attached it on the floor.

1162
02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.500
It was a Turcotte-Osborne amendment.

1163
02:36:34.500 --> 02:36:39.500
It passed 162 to 153 to attach it to 407.

1164
02:36:39.500 --> 02:36:41.500
We non-concurred.

1165
02:36:41.500 --> 02:36:45.500
And subsequent, and we put 407 into 1099.

1166
02:36:45.500 --> 02:36:52.000
Going back to the division work session, you had several in the House.

1167
02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:55.000
You had one on April 25th.

1168
02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:58.500
You had another one on April 26th.

1169
02:36:58.500 --> 02:37:02.500
You had an executive session on April 27th.

1170
02:37:02.500 --> 02:37:09.000
The committee report was 20 to 0, and it went to the floor.

1171
02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:21.000
Then you had the roll call on the floor amendment, and then the overall bill with the other floor amendment passed 295 to 28.

1172
02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:27.500
So I think suffice it to say, House Finance unanimously supported the 200K.

1173
02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:29.500
Thank you, Mr.

1174
02:37:29.500 --> 02:37:31.500
Chair.

1175
02:37:31.500 --> 02:37:49.000
So just to be clear and i'm i'm asking you about your memory more than mine and that is um there was also a cushman bill that created some immunization exemption exemptions for religious grounds.

1176
02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
Yeah.

1177
02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
Yes the case.

1178
02:37:53.000 --> 02:38:14.500
you The House concurred with the senate amendment and the concurrence motion was representative pearson's motion so that bill passed okay thank you so much for that now we could talk about 1210 if you want to know why we didn't support it.

1179
02:38:14.500 --> 02:38:16.500
No, I don't.

1180
02:38:16.500 --> 02:38:18.500
Okay, I don't either.

1181
02:38:18.500 --> 02:38:29.000
And that's because the Cushman bill, when it came to Division III, we beefed up the religious exemption side of it.

1182
02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:33.000
We left the middle one alone, I think.

1183
02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:37.000
I don't remember what the middle exemption was.

1184
02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
I should.

1185
02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:53.000
And we got rid of the conscience exemption because there was no analogy in the Medicare-Medicaid provisions for conscience, and we didn't want to jeopardize our Medicaid funding.

1186
02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.500
So we stripped that out.

1187
02:38:55.500 --> 02:39:29.500
So that's a long way around saying that as long as this postpartum component isn't affecting the Cushman religious exemption part of it and it's only you only stripped out the conscience part then I'm good with it representative Lang's bill is a little different than representative Cushman's bill as I recall and I'd have and I can look back if you want me to at the text.

1188
02:39:29.500 --> 02:39:39.500
I think that Representative Cushman's bill just dealt with New Hampshire Hospital and Glencliffe, both of which are Medicaid eligible.

1189
02:39:39.500 --> 02:39:42.500
So there was an impact there.

1190
02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:46.500
Hats off to you, Jess, sorry, Representative Edwards.

1191
02:39:46.500 --> 02:39:50.500
You did a great job in Division III.

1192
02:39:50.500 --> 02:40:09.000
The same pressure that we were under on Representative Lang's bill, 1210, which had an impact because it was broader than just Representative Cushman's bill on hospitals, doctors, anybody that not only took Medicaid patients, but Medicare.

1193
02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:18.500
And we just, even though I think some of us felt that, you know, people shouldn't be getting fired.

1194
02:40:18.500 --> 02:40:22.000
It was like, what do you do?

1195
02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:28.500
And, you know, if Medicaid and Medicare funding were going to be threatened.

1196
02:40:28.500 --> 02:40:45.000
And I think just as you found, when you looked at 1604, there was a credible threat that you did the right thing, and I think we did the right thing on 1210.

1197
02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:56.000
But when 1210 came back to us on Senate Bill 407, the postpartum bill, then that's when we attached it to this.

1198
02:40:56.000 --> 02:41:39.500
I truly appreciate summary and um and so mr chair i think the the the takeaway is that this postpartum component is the house position yes yes yes yes yes yes yes well i see four items and they're all good so taken as a whole yes or no position is that we support the bill as amended by the bradley amendment and the thirty thousand dollars how do we make the 30 000 change i don't i don't oh well that's good Yeah, they'll do something.

1199
02:41:39.500 --> 02:41:42.000
We can get down together.

1200
02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
Yeah.

1201
02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:47.000
And we'll sign off on that.

1202
02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:51.500
I think it's just a change in the appropriation.

1203
02:41:51.500 --> 02:41:59.000
They'll need to do a consolidated amendment for both the Bradley change and the 30,000.

1204
02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:08.500
And you need to write your report because the House procedure has, you know, different than the Senate procedure.

1205
02:42:08.500 --> 02:42:15.500
And it'll probably be ready to sign off, I would guess, by noontime tomorrow.

1206
02:42:15.500 --> 02:42:17.500
Sounds like a plan.

1207
02:42:17.500 --> 02:42:19.500
We're done.

1208
02:42:19.500 --> 02:42:21.500
Thank you, everybody.

1209
02:42:21.500 --> 02:42:26.000
Senator Gray, reminder, you have a meeting in Rochester.

1210
02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.500
Thank you for reminding me.

1211
02:42:28.500 --> 02:42:30.500
Thank you.

1212
02:42:30.500 --> 02:42:33.500
In action, I should make it.

1213
02:42:33.500 --> 02:42:35.500
Okay.
