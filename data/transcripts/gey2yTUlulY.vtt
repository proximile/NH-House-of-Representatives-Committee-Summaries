00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
amendments to be distributed to the
 
00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
committee no later than 24 hours ahead
 
00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:57.640 align:start position:0%
of the executive session
 
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
so then I have um some information with
 
00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
regard to committee reports I won't go
 
00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.630 align:start position:0%
regard to committee reports I won't go
through

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.670 align:start position:0%
 
own

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
and so with regards to committee
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
reports if you have been if you
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
volunteer or you are assigned to write a
 
00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
committee report that may be a majority
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
or a Minority Report they shall be
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
submitted to both myself and the vice
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
chair representative McDonald for review
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible or no later than 48
 
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
hours following the executive session
 
00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
this is important because I'm
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
responsible to review everything to make
 
00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:49.240 align:start position:0%
sure that it is accurate and that it is
 
00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
follow that it follows the proper
 
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
format and additionally after that the
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh committee reports go to the committee
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
researcher she has things that she needs
 
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
to look at that's part of her job and
 
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
then it goes to the speaker of the house
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
and he has the final
 
00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:11.720 align:start position:0%
say so
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
um I need to pass in the bill file in
 
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:17.720 align:start position:0%
order that contains the committee report
 
00:50:20.349 --> 00:50:20.359 align:start position:0%
and other paperwork in order for the
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
bills to appear in the house calendar so
 
00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
that they can go to the house floor
 
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
notably house deadlines might require a
 
00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
shorter submission timeline to to myself
 
00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
in which case I will make every effort
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
to give you a heads up on that um we may
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
need to have same day submissions but I
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
will let you
 
00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
know um I already went over that and
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
just to reiterate there there are some
 
00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
handouts um with regards
 
00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
to what a committee uh like a proper
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
well-written committee report should
 
00:51:02.589 --> 00:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
look like and contain uh dis and and I
 
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
did give you some example reports that I
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
authored only because I had access to
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
those um on my
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
computer there are other um committee
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
reports that that you could use as a
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
model please um reference the um the
 
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
house calendars for that so um
 
00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
one other thing that I would like to um
 
00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
offer to this committee is what I call
 
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
guideline principles for Effective
 
00:51:38.589 --> 00:51:38.599 align:start position:0%
committee meetings so I have four main
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
topics and I I will go through this
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
because I think this is important
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
reflection be mindful of personal
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
assumptions and biases be tolerant of
 
00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
views which conflict with yours
 
00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:52.280 align:start position:0%
communication express yourself with
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
Clarity and respect for both yourself
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
and others listening
 
00:51:59.870 --> 00:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
actively listen with the intent to
 
00:52:02.349 --> 00:52:02.359 align:start position:0%
understand be receptive to what others
 
00:52:05.069 --> 00:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
say in consideration of the possibility
 
00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
that they might have knowledge Andor
 
00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
insights that you lack and lastly
 
00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
evaluation consider carefully consider
 
00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
all inputs and information before
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
arriving at a conclusion I I think that
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
if we can follow these guidelines in
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
this committee and with regards to um
 
00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:29.720 align:start position:0%
the people's work that we have before us
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
we will do an excellent job and be
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
effective and um productive as a
 
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
committee so to wrap it up miscellaneous
 
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
um I've noted to please see house rules
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
45 as well as rules house rules 100
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
through1 um for more detailed
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
information with regards to committees
 
00:52:57.069 --> 00:52:57.079 align:start position:0%
so um anticipated bills to this referred
 
00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
to this committee it looks like we're
 
00:53:02.789 --> 00:53:02.799 align:start position:0%
going to have quite a bit so um uh based
 
00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:05.559 align:start position:0%
on the lsrs that were
 
00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
requested it looks to me like we going
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
to potentially have 60 house bills the
 
00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:15.640 align:start position:0%
last time I checked on Sunday we have 40
 
00:53:17.069 --> 00:53:17.079 align:start position:0%
referred to this
 
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
estimating maybe as many as that Senate
 
00:53:29.549 --> 00:53:29.559 align:start position:0%
Bill LSR s have been requested they AR
 
00:53:31.789 --> 00:53:31.799 align:start position:0%
aren't all going to come over to the
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
house but we're going to maybe have um a
 
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
fair amount but we deal with the Senate
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
bills after
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
crossover um okay so again for now house
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh our committee meetings will be our
 
00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
regular committee day will be
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
Monday um I will always have
 
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
announcements at the beginning of our
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
meetings as well as at the end for
 
00:53:58.510 --> 00:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
important dates to that that we need to
 
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:03.160 align:start position:0%
be um attentive to and just to reiterate
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
how sessions will normally be held on
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
Thursdays with the possibility of a
 
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and to conclude this
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
orientation I would ask that all

00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
Municipal property tax those that are
 
00:58:30.799 --> 00:58:32.549 align:start position:0%
Municipal property tax those that are
not

00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
registered are there for the season if
 
00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:37.720 align:start position:0%
they're there on on on April 1st uh the
 
00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
municipality would then collect assess
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
and and collect uh real estate taxes
 
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
from those RVs that like a cabin or a
 
00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
cottage on on U on on the campground
 
00:58:53.789 --> 00:58:53.799 align:start position:0%
property um the problem is and this was
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
identified to me by my discussions with
 
00:58:58.109 --> 00:58:58.119 align:start position:0%
the collector and assessing Department
 
00:58:58.119 --> 00:58:59.190 align:start position:0%
the collector and assessing Department
in

00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
Swansea that it takes hours and hours to
 
00:59:03.549 --> 00:59:03.559 align:start position:0%
track down all these people a lot of
 
00:59:05.069 --> 00:59:05.079 align:start position:0%
them are out of state
 
00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:09.640 align:start position:0%
people uh they often find that the RV
 
00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:12.440 align:start position:0%
has been sold there's no real process
 
00:59:15.029 --> 00:59:15.039 align:start position:0%
for for stopping that sale or or
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
collecting taxes before the sale uh
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
there these you know it depends on the
 
00:59:21.069 --> 00:59:21.079 align:start position:0%
state that they're from whether they
 
00:59:23.309 --> 00:59:23.319 align:start position:0%
have a title or not
 
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
um it's um it it takes more time and
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
more effort for them to collect real
 
00:59:29.599 --> 00:59:30.670 align:start position:0%
more effort for them to collect real
estate

00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
estate
 
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
taxes uh than than they actually realize
 
00:59:37.029 --> 00:59:37.039 align:start position:0%
through the taxes so the idea here is to
 
00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
is to have a a fixed fee a small fee uh
 
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
that would be collected in lie of real
 
00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
estate taxes on these uh RVs that are
 
00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:48.799 align:start position:0%
basically used as yearround seasonal uh
 
00:59:48.799 --> 00:59:50.670 align:start position:0%
basically used as yearround seasonal uh
vacation

00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
vacation
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
homes um again this is a request I
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
received from the to of Swansea we have
 
00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
the the uh Town Administrator here to
 
01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
answer more detailed questions but I'd
 
01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer what I
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
can thank you representative fogner for
 
01:00:07.029 --> 01:00:07.039 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill are there any
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Dolan thank you
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:00:21.549 --> 01:00:21.559 align:start position:0%
question uh what would the fees be uh
 
01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
that are proposed to be collected so the
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
way this is set up is that the
 
01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
municipality would have the option of
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
imposing a fee or they could continue to
 
01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:31.720 align:start position:0%
collect real estate taxes if they set a
 
01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
fee that that would be up to the select
 
01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:37.160 align:start position:0%
Town bill has a maximum of
 
01:00:40.029 --> 01:00:40.039 align:start position:0%
$200 $200
 
01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
annually um so but they could pick any
 
01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
number up to that uh
 
01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
typically these uh if you were to
 
01:00:51.309 --> 01:00:51.319 align:start position:0%
register your your RV trailer for
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
example you would be paying a taxes to
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
wherever Town you're registered in it be
 
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
based upon the original sales price and
 
01:01:00.430 --> 01:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
the depreciation you
 
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
know you know that that that fee
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
schedule set up by the state so $200
 
01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
$100 is sort of in the uh often would be
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
they less than they would pay in in in
 
01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
taxes to the
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
town uh but you know it's really it's a
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
matter of um if if they don't want to
 
01:01:25.109 --> 01:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
pay that fee then they register their
 
01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:27.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle RV as a
 
01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle thank
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions for
 
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative
 
01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:43.160 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair um how did
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
you arrive at the fee
 
01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:49.480 align:start position:0%
of not to exceed $200 was that something
 
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
that the assessors recommended based on
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
what they are trying to collect right
 
01:01:57.309 --> 01:01:57.319 align:start position:0%
now or yes we discuss the value again
 
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
it's not so much at least from swansea's
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
point of view the it's not so much how
 
01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
much they're collecting but how much
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
time they have to spend to collect it
 
01:02:09.269 --> 01:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
because we're spending you know hours on
 
01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:13.839 align:start position:0%
that um the $200 is is approximately
 
01:02:16.349 --> 01:02:16.359 align:start position:0%
what you would pay
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
in real estate property taxes for a a uh
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
do my math
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
correctly a RV that might be a at
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
$8,000 because if it's if it's
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
registered then it's that's not exactly
 
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
how it works but uh again that brings in
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
point another problem is that the
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
assessors don't really have
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
a experience in how to Value
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
recreational vehicles I mean they're
 
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
they do buildings and
 
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
land so it's kind of a hit or miss
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
whether they they get that number
 
01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
correctly but it would be what they
 
01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
would pay if their RV were valued at
 
01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
about $8,000 a typical $25 per thousand
 
01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:01.029 align:start position:0%
about $8,000 a typical $25 per thousand
Municipal

01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:21.640 align:start position:0%
you next to speak to this bill is Jeremy
 
01:03:28.589 --> 01:03:28.599 align:start position:0%

01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
Campground Owners Association the
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
association opposes the amendment to uh
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
7270 or HBA
 
01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.549 align:start position:0%

84
 
01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
um I can
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate what uh appears to be the
 
01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
intent behind this amendment to the RSA
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
um however its implications are
 
01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
concerning as the executive director of
 
01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
the a membership based Association that
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
represents over 100 private business
 
01:04:16.349 --> 01:04:16.359 align:start position:0%
owners I manage significant day-to-day
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
operations along with Duce collections
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
production of an annual 100 page
 
01:04:23.069 --> 01:04:23.079 align:start position:0%
publication en camping and recreational
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
vehicle show with close to 100
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
exhibitors in 7,000 to8 7 to 8,000
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
attendees annually I'm very familiar
 
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
with the challenges of chasing
 
01:04:35.069 --> 01:04:35.079 align:start position:0%
money however this amendment as it's
 
01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
written is complex and the language is
 
01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
open to Broad
 
01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
interpretation it's unclear whether the
 
01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
proposed Municipal fee is intended to be
 
01:04:46.269 --> 01:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
a supplement or replace existing taxes
 
01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
the association was not consulted before
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment was in introduced
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
obviously hindering the opportunity to
 
01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
have a thorough and informed discussion
 
01:04:56.910 --> 01:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
which in turn ends up bringing us here
 
01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
today um the origins of this RSA predate
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
the decade that I've been with the
 
01:05:04.589 --> 01:05:04.599 align:start position:0%
association but um I can tell you
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
throughout that time it has been nothing
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
but a continuous confusion and conflict
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
I've had a number of conversations with
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
the Dr office uh discussing the issues
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
that it
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
creates I've encountered situations
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
ranging from towns attempting to place
 
01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
leans on campsites uh which are property
 
01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
taxes have already been paid by the
 
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
owners the town's trying to impose tax
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
liabilities on new seasonal campers for
 
01:05:33.269 --> 01:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
previous campers uncollected
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
debts I've also seen towns attempting to
 
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
enforce r rsas that don't apply um I've
 
01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
even seen notices to campers threatening
 
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor charges for moving campers
 
01:05:46.269 --> 01:05:46.279 align:start position:0%
before approving tax payment I actually
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
have a permission to move mobile home
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
notice that was sent despite these being
 
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
recreational vehicles not mobile homes
 
01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
um it's actually signed by the tax
 
01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
collector ctor and the board of
 
01:05:57.390 --> 01:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
selectman from the
 
01:06:00.029 --> 01:06:00.039 align:start position:0%
town I can't even fathom to imagine the
 
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
liability issues that were involved if
 
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
the campground owner had been told uh to
 
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
prevent someone from leaving their
 
01:06:08.190 --> 01:06:08.200 align:start position:0%
property before taxes are being
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
paid a number of Campground owners
 
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
indicated in conversations that these
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities find current system
 
01:06:16.349 --> 01:06:16.359 align:start position:0%
burdensome and sometimes they don't even
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
want to deal with it I've actually read
 
01:06:20.349 --> 01:06:20.359 align:start position:0%
minutes from a board of assessor meeting
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
revealing that the Town Administrator
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
States believing the administrative
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
effort to access assess these vehicles
 
01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
outweighs the revenue generated yet they
 
01:06:31.069 --> 01:06:31.079 align:start position:0%
have no alternative because of what it
 
01:06:32.589 --> 01:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
states in the
 
01:06:35.269 --> 01:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
RSA particularly problematic aspect of
 
01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
this amendment um is an attempt to
 
01:06:39.789 --> 01:06:39.799 align:start position:0%
unfairly place the burden of collecting
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
taxes and fees on Campground owners
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
they're not Tax Collectors this
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
amendment lacks Clarity regarding the
 
01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
calculation of the proposed fee of up to
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
$200 and the criteria for which it's
 
01:06:54.349 --> 01:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
based um this uncertainty is just
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
another extension of the inconsistent
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
application of recreational vehicles
 
01:07:01.829 --> 01:07:01.839 align:start position:0%
that I see often I think you're seeing
 
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
evidence of this in another form with
 
01:07:05.549 --> 01:07:05.559 align:start position:0%
what's going on in Rochester right now
 
01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
where it sounds like they've recently
 
01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
tried to Value recreational vehicle as
 
01:07:11.789 --> 01:07:11.799 align:start position:0%
if it was a home furthermore this
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
amendment doesn't clarify who'll be
 
01:07:15.789 --> 01:07:15.799 align:start position:0%
collecting fees from other land owners
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
across the state who have unregistered
 
01:07:20.109 --> 01:07:20.119 align:start position:0%
RVs or trailers on their properties you
 
01:07:22.029 --> 01:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
know one of the reasons why some of
 
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
these RVs are not registered is because
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
they are left there in storage at the
 
01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
campgrounds are in the winter when
 
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
they're not open their permanent residen
 
01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
is somewhere else they only they're
 
01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
they're only here for the summer if
 
01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:35.480 align:start position:0%
there was stored at another facility it
 
01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even be subject to this
 
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
taxation the reality is that this is not
 
01:07:44.349 --> 01:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
a revenue generator for mun towns and M
 
01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities in most instan most
 
01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
instances it seems they incur more time
 
01:07:54.029 --> 01:07:54.039 align:start position:0%
effort and expense than the revenue that
 
01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
it brings in I think if that wasn't the
 
01:07:59.670 --> 01:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
case I don't think we'd be here today um
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
that being said I would propose the most
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
straightforward solution which is
 
01:08:05.870 --> 01:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
completely remove recreational vehicles
 
01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
as defined in RSA 216 I from this
 
01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:10.720 align:start position:0%

name is Michael branley I'm Town

Administrator for the town of Swansea
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
and I am here in support of HB
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
84 um Swansea is home to three c three
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
campgrounds two of which allow
 
01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
recreational vehicles to stay
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
unregistered in the campground year
 
01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
round several years ago the Department
 
01:09:06.269 --> 01:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
of Revenue Administration began
 
01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
requiring municipalities to tax
 
01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
unregistered RVs in campgrounds as real
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
estate Swansea complied with this
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
requirement however quickly realized
 
01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
several flaws with the system first the
 
01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
amount of tax revenue genate generated
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
comes nowhere near covering the costs to
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
develop the values collect the tax and
 
01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
deal with the problems that the Bill's
 
01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
cause taxing RVs requires the town's
 
01:09:30.510 --> 01:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
assessor which for many communities
 
01:09:33.070 --> 01:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
including Swansea is a contra is a
 
01:09:34.669 --> 01:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
contractor paid hourly for their
 
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
services to inspect the campground
 
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
around April 1st the assessor inspects
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
the campgrounds for unregistered RVs and
 
01:09:43.229 --> 01:09:43.239 align:start position:0%
develops an assessed value for them
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
based on their age make and model of the
 
01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
60 RVs Swansea taxed in 2024 the average
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
tax bill was
 
01:09:54.269 --> 01:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
$114 of that total almost a third of the
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
tax bill value and end up being abated
 
01:09:58.750 --> 01:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
or waved so the town only collected
 
01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:00.110 align:start position:0%
or waved so the town only collected
around

01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
$4,700 of which about 25% stays with the
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
town or under
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
$1,200 this is like the loss of money on
 
01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
dog licenses although at least those
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
have the purpose of rabies
 
01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
prevention as has been mentioned by
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
other speakers taxing a mobile home a
 
01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
mobile vehicle like an RV is not like
 
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
taxing a home or other real property in
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
ways that make it very challenging to
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
colle collect this tax if a land owner
 
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
does not pay their property taxes the
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
town will put a lean on the deed at the
 
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
registry of deeds and either collect
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
when the property sells or eventually
 
01:10:34.189 --> 01:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
take ownership by tax deed with an RV
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
there is no deed to lean or mechanism to
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
take ownership or Force repayment this
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
creates the worst kind of tax where
 
01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
conscientious people who pay the bill
 
01:10:44.830 --> 01:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
they receive are punished and those who
 
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
do not do not pay it suffer no
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
consequence also unlike other real
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
estate RVs can also be registered as a
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle an RV that is registered is not
 
01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
subject to property tax because property
 
01:10:59.310 --> 01:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
is taxed as of April 1st which is not
 
01:11:01.149 --> 01:11:01.159 align:start position:0%
exactly Peak camping season in New
 
01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the registration stickers are
 
01:11:05.229 --> 01:11:05.239 align:start position:0%
often not on the RVs when the town
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
inspects the tax bills in May then
 
01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
prompt phone calls from irate RV owners
 
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
who received a tax bill even though
 
01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
their RV was registered either because
 
01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
it was not registered on April 1st or
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
the sticker was not yet on the vehicle
 
01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
also because there is no deed ownership
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
information comes from the campgrounds
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
who have no incentive to provide
 
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
accurate information inaccurate billing
 
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
leads to needing to generate new bills
 
01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:31.669 align:start position:0%
leads to needing to generate new bills
Andor

01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
Andor
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
abatements HB 84 seeks to solve these
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
and other issues with the current system
 
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
by eliminating this unjust tax and
 
01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
replacing it with a fee on the
 
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
campgrounds for unregistered RVs the fee
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
will be collectable by the municipality
 
01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
from the campground where the current
 
01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
tax is difficult to collect by
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
generating a flat amount per RV the time
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
and cost to develop individual
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
assessments based on the specific
 
01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
details of of the RV is eliminated call
 
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
to the calls to the town from RV owners
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
disputing the tax saying their RV was
 
01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
registered or sold uh and any number of
 
01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
other issues will no longer happen I
 
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
think there's been discussion about
 
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
trying to develop another solution I
 
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
think we'd be supportive of that uh we
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
just wanted to start the discussion
 
01:12:16.830 --> 01:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
about trying to collect an issue which
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
it sounds like is a problem for uh the
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
campground owners as
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr branley other
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
questions for the speaker
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative Walker thank you madam
 
01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
chair uh I'm from Rochester so it's
 
01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
blowing up in my uh my community I just
 
01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
had a quick question with your parks in
 
01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
Swansea do you have campers that have
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
additions like enclosed porches adus
 
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
because that's what we have in Rochester
 
01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
which qualifies for Real Estate so our
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
primary focus is on the RVs themselves
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not I don't want to speak to
 
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
improvements such as decks and
 
01:12:57.550 --> 01:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
enclosures like that I'm not aware of
 
01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
that part of the issue so much it's more
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
the RVs specifically for us well the
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
reason why I ask is
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
that those RVs are no longer mobile when
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
they're like that so I just wondering if
 
01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
your assessor uh I guess you have a
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
contractor has noted that anywhere that
 
01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
they're actually permanent structures
 
01:13:19.149 --> 01:13:19.159 align:start position:0%
now not that I recall but I could get
 
01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
back to the comme on that that's all as
 
01:13:25.149 --> 01:13:25.159 align:start position:0%
a a reminder to new committee members
 
01:13:27.390 --> 01:13:27.400 align:start position:0%
you are permitted to ask one question
 
01:13:29.950 --> 01:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
and then you need to ask permission to
 
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
followup are there any other questions
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you also if you have
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
some written testimony could you pass
 
01:13:41.679 --> 01:13:48.270 align:start position:0%
some written testimony could you pass
that

01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
along next we have Mr Richard
 
01:13:55.629 --> 01:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
Sullivan for the rord state un
 
01:13:58.750 --> 01:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
name who you represent and your position
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
on the bill thank
 
01:14:02.669 --> 01:14:02.679 align:start position:0%
you my name is Richard
 
01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
Sullivan I represent Harbor Hill
 
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
campground in Meredith New Hampshire and
 
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
I'm here to oppose this bill today
 
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
because I think it unfairly treats
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
campgrounds um as opposed to any other
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
property owner um back in 2013 is is
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
when the Department of Revenue sent out
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
notices to all the assessors that they
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
had to really clamp down on this new law
 
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
and and start enforcing
 
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
taxing uh RVs and other unregistered
 
01:14:36.669 --> 01:14:36.679 align:start position:0%
trailers so I got this letter that said
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
they'll begin assessing trailers
 
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the town and this includes
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
travel trailers in campgrounds as well
 
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
as unregistered box trailers used as
 
01:14:49.870 --> 01:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
storage so um fast forward 10 years
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
later so that that April in 2013 the
 
01:14:55.709 --> 01:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
assessor came to my Campground
 
01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
and I welcomed him showed him around and
 
01:15:01.709 --> 01:15:01.719 align:start position:0%
I asked how are you going to attempt
 
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
to you know if you're going to treat if
 
01:15:05.709 --> 01:15:05.719 align:start position:0%
you're going to tax me for my
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
unregistered trailers on my property how
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
are you going to go around the rest of
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
the town and capture all these other
 
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
structures and box trailers and all
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
these things um so that we're all being
 
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
treated fairly in the town you can't
 
01:15:22.030 --> 01:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
just come straight after a campground
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
and he said over the 10 years assessors
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
go to properties um visit each property
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
every at least once every 10 years and
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
he said I'll capture them all then as I
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
go around I still felt that was unfair
 
01:15:37.709 --> 01:15:37.719 align:start position:0%
because he comes to my Campground every
 
01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
year but he he's only going to look at
 
01:15:43.629 --> 01:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
everybody else's property every 10 years
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
so fast forward 10 years later they've
 
01:15:49.470 --> 01:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
never taxed another trailer anywhere
 
01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
else in the property anywhere else in
 
01:15:55.870 --> 01:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
Meredith maybe that's not 100% true I I
 
01:15:59.709 --> 01:15:59.719 align:start position:0%
but I can point to numerous um box
 
01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
trailers throughout my town that are not
 
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
being taxed because I can see it all on
 
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
the assessing database so I feel like
 
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
we're being very unfairly targeted um by
 
01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
this bill and by and by the previous one
 
01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
but I by I understand the the the need
 
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
for the law the idea behind it so I'm
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
not 100% against the idea but the way
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
it's being enforced is unfairly
 
01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.510 align:start position:0%
it's being enforced is unfairly
targeting

01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
targeting
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
campgrounds um there's no other property
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
owners in any town that are being asked
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
to self
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
declare uh uh you know real EST low
 
01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
value real estate lots of people have
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
sheds other trailers that technically
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
are called real estate there's no other
 
01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:49.400 align:start position:0%
proposal that would that would tax these
 
01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
structures to treat us all fairly so um
 
01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your time that's that's all
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
I had to say I feel it's very unfair
 
01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
Dees thank you uh Madam chairwoman and
 
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
the rest of the committee my name is
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
Brody Dees and I represent the Hampshire
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association we are a voluntary
 
01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
Association made up of uh all the towns
 
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire um and we
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
advocate for their interest here in
 
01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
conquered and on different bills and
 
01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
proposals that come before your
 
01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
committee and others um I testifying in
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 84 um this was a
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
member request by the town of Swansea
 
01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
and a few others to their local
 
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
legislature and they contacted us about
 
01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
the issue that they are dealing with
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
which is um the cost to try to assess
 
01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
all of these individual RVs that aren't
 
01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
registered and with the timeline of when
 
01:18:06.669 --> 01:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
they have to be assessing them um makes
 
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
it so then at times they're either
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
losing money or barely breaking even um
 
01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
trying to uh collect this Revenue um
 
01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
these are improvements that are made to
 
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
these properties if someone is for
 
01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
example as the representative alluded to
 
01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
earlier are making improvements to an RV
 
01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
that they're essentially using similarly
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
to an fix structure um the goal isn't to
 
01:18:30.629 --> 01:18:30.639 align:start position:0%
try to squeeze um campgrounds and to
 
01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
make their lives more difficult the goal
 
01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that towns are able to
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
collect the revenues that uh state law
 
01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
um currently permits them to collect and
 
01:18:41.229 --> 01:18:41.239 align:start position:0%
this is a way to make it more workable
 
01:18:44.629 --> 01:18:44.639 align:start position:0%
for those towns um to make it more fair
 
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
um when they're trying to collect this
 
01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue so um I think with that there's
 
01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:51.560 align:start position:0%
been a lot of great points that were
 
01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
brought up by the town of Swansea in the
 
01:18:55.950 --> 01:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
issues that towns are dealing with when
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
trying to assess and collect this tax
 
01:19:00.510 --> 01:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
revenue and um hopefully this will be a
 
01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
way where uh campgrounds can essentially
 
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
collect the fee from these people who
 
01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
don't register their RVs and then can
 
01:19:08.830 --> 01:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
include that in their property tax bills
 
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
as a way to streamline the um the
 
01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
assessing and the collecting process for
 
01:19:15.870 --> 01:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
these communities uh with that I will um
 
01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
take any questions that the committee
 
01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
members have thank you Mr dases any
 
01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
you so the final p pink card that I have
 
01:19:33.629 --> 01:19:33.639 align:start position:0%
here on House Bill 84 is
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
for Mr Dave and I don't can't make out
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
that last
 
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
name could you repeat that when when you
 
01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.709 align:start position:0%
name could you repeat that when when you
sit

01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
down also I think that you've indicated
 
01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
that you would like 10 minutes to speak
 
01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
that was oh yeah um some of what I've
 
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
said has already been said perfect so
 
01:19:59.149 --> 01:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
don't repeat that just add new new
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
information and try to keep it um 3
 
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
minutes or less thanks uh it looks the
 
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
first read of that bills uh clearly uh I
 
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
don't have it in front of me but it it
 
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
seems the witness to spend for could you
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
please for the record state your name

in your position uh Dave bankus I'm from
wolfb

01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
wolfb
 
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm the treasurer of the New
 
01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Campground
 
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
Association I've also owned a campground
 
01:20:34.350 --> 01:20:34.360 align:start position:0%
in my family for 55
 
01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
years and we have quite a bit of
 
01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
this when I first skimmed over the bill
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
I said great my wife is doing all the
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
assessor work chasing down registrations
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
and things like that and presents a
 
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
package to the town every April 1st and
 
01:20:59.310 --> 01:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
I said she's going to get 200 bucks for
 
01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
her work and then I read it again and
 
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
realized that it was
 
01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
charging an additional
 
01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:10.360 align:start position:0%
$200 so I'm still a little confused
 
01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
because the sponsor of the bill clearly
 
01:21:16.030 --> 01:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
said this morning and in an email to our
 
01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
association that this $200 was instead
 
01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
of Taxation which I have different
 
01:21:26.669 --> 01:21:26.679 align:start position:0%
feelings about uh 25 years ago 30 years
 
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
ago we used to measure the trailers and
 
01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
if they were under 320 square feet they
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
were considered
 
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
untaxable and it was pretty clean and
 
01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
simple this
 
01:21:44.590 --> 01:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
taxing things with wheels as real estate
 
01:21:46.270 --> 01:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
is very
 
01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
problematic and uh it just is difficult
 
01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
to work so you're dealing with something
 
01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
that'll never work in the first place uh
 
01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
we've had
 
01:21:58.189 --> 01:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
we've had trailers that have left with
 
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
no forwarding address and a lean was put
 
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
on our
 
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
campsite so that the next person that
 
01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
occupied it got a tax bill for previous
 
01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
occupants that they never even knew so
 
01:22:14.189 --> 01:22:14.199 align:start position:0%
what do you do in that situation if
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
you're a campground owner and you have
 
01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:18.639 align:start position:0%
two sites and one has a lean on it and
 
01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
the tax bill is going to fall on anyone
 
01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
who occupies that site you pay the bill
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
so the law says we're not liable for it
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
but in all practicality we have paid the
 
01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
bills other than that uh it's very
 
01:22:37.709 --> 01:22:37.719 align:start position:0%
unfair in the fact that it applies to
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
campgrounds but it's inexpedient to make
 
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
it apply to everyone in the town not 50
 
01:22:46.350 --> 01:22:46.360 align:start position:0%
ft from my property line my neighbor has
 
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
a box trailer and a motor home that have
 
01:22:51.870 --> 01:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
been sitting there for at least 20 years
 
01:22:53.950 --> 01:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
and through many evaluations when I
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
checked last Friday they were not
 
01:23:01.390 --> 01:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
taxed so the tax is inequitable in the
 
01:23:03.310 --> 01:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
fact that if you park something outside
 
01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
of a campground it's just too hard to
 
01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
find it too hard to appraise it and too
 
01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
hard to tax it the gentleman sponsor of
 
01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
this bill looks like he's trying to
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
attach that problem he's trying to make
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
it easier for me to play a fat a flat
 
01:23:17.679 --> 01:23:19.229 align:start position:0%
it easier for me to play a fat a flat
fee

01:23:19.229 --> 01:23:19.239 align:start position:0%
fee
 
01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
tax but it still doesn't address the
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
inequality of the fact that if you are
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
part somewhere in the town they will
 
01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719 align:start position:0%
never find your RV and they will never
 
01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
tax it the unit 50 ft from my property
 
01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
is a box trailer which I think is
 
01:23:35.629 --> 01:23:35.639 align:start position:0%
exactly what this started with in
 
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
Atkinson when the judge said you have to
 
01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
tax the box
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
trailers so anyway I'm not I put down
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
that I was not in favor of this because
 
01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
I was in the impression that it was an
 
01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
addition to
 
01:23:51.390 --> 01:23:51.400 align:start position:0%
tax I still am a little confused but I'm
 
01:23:53.189 --> 01:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
under the impression this morning that
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
this is in lie of it
 
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
attacks which I think I could I think I
 
01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
could work with that because it it would
 
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
simplify things a little bit like it was
 
01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:05.430 align:start position:0%
simplify things a little bit like it was
years

01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
ago and my wife will have less
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
work it would the tax the if they Town
 
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
charged $200 my wife would be paying
 
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.149 align:start position:0%
charged $200 my wife would be paying
over

01:24:16.149 --> 01:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:24:18.149 --> 01:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
$122,000 to the
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
town in addition to the tax but if it
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
was instead of the tax I I don't know I
 
01:24:27.070 --> 01:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
think maybe there's some hope
 
01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:28.669 align:start position:0%
think maybe there's some hope
here

01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
question thank you sir
 
01:24:35.629 --> 01:24:35.639 align:start position:0%
questions I I had one with regards to
 
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
the the the the the box container in a
 
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh camper that you referenced parked I
 
01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
think you said in your neighborhood or
 
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
whatnot are do people reside no no it's
 
01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
it's um the original court case had to
 
01:24:55.629 --> 01:24:55.639 align:start position:0%
do with box Trail that were used for
 
01:24:58.270 --> 01:24:58.280 align:start position:0%
storage my neighbor has a box trailer
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
used for storage and it's never been
 
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
taxed right up until last Friday when I
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
checked they also have an RV motor home
 
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
parked in their property but the problem
 
01:25:10.510 --> 01:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
is the tax department goes for the low
 
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
hanging fruit so they go to the T
 
01:25:15.149 --> 01:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
campgrounds because it's like harvesting
 
01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:17.480 align:start position:0%
a cluster of grapes with one
 
01:25:21.070 --> 01:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
snip my wife does all the work but to go
 
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
all over town and try to search out
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
every trailer every RV is like every tax
 
01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:30.639 align:start position:0%
assessor I've talked to says that's just
 
01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
not cost effective thank you thank you
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
any other questions seeing
 
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
none uh is there anybody else in the
 
01:25:41.229 --> 01:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
room who would like to speak to this
 
01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
bill who hasn't had the opportunity to
 
01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:48.950 align:start position:0%
bill who hasn't had the opportunity to
do

01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
fauler um
 
01:25:58.109 --> 01:25:58.119 align:start position:0%
you could email your clarification to
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you so um with that
 
01:26:03.149 --> 01:26:03.159 align:start position:0%

01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:25.750 align:start position:0%
 
86

01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%

time I am going to open the public
 
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 86 FN local
 
01:27:37.870 --> 01:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
increasing the cost of service for
 
01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
notice of civil forfeiture of unlicensed
 
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
dogs to the rate for certified mail and
 
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
we have with us this morning
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
representative St Clair who is the Prime
 
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor to introduce the bill to the
 
01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
committee welcome representative St
 
01:27:52.520 --> 01:28:01.229 align:start position:0%
committee welcome representative St
Clair

01:28:01.229 --> 01:28:01.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:04.109 --> 01:28:04.119 align:start position:0%
and it is indeed a pleasure to be here
 
01:28:05.709 --> 01:28:05.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:08.669 --> 01:28:08.679 align:start position:0%
um this is I hate to say this but this
 
01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
is really to me a common sense
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
um answer to a a situation we have in
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
lonia and apparently
 
01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
Statewide where postage rates have gone
 
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
up and the cost of mailing out
 
01:28:27.109 --> 01:28:27.119 align:start position:0%
notices to people who have not
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
registered their dogs has not gone up to
 
01:28:31.229 --> 01:28:31.239 align:start position:0%
meet that
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
therefore my constituents in District 5
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
lonia are subsidizing no matter how
 
01:28:38.830 --> 01:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
small the amount may be or large the
 
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
amount may be the postage to people who
 
01:28:46.270 --> 01:28:46.280 align:start position:0%
have not done their duty to register
 
01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:47.229 align:start position:0%

their
 
01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:50.719 align:start position:0%
dogs and that that's really
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
the pretty clear description of of what
 
01:28:56.350 --> 01:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do here with this
 
01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
bill and my city clerk uh is here to uh

for that bill introduction
 
01:29:11.669 --> 01:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
representative are questions for the
 
01:29:11.679 --> 01:29:13.350 align:start position:0%
representative are questions for the
prime

01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
prime
 
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
again next to speak on House Bill 86 I
 
01:29:30.510 --> 01:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
Gargano so it looks like you've
 
01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
indicated four minutes um if
 
01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
possible please take three or
 
01:29:42.629 --> 01:29:42.639 align:start position:0%
less I had to Charlie told me to change
 
01:29:45.109 --> 01:29:45.119 align:start position:0%
it to
 
01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
four uh good morning Madam chairperson
 
01:29:49.149 --> 01:29:49.159 align:start position:0%
and committee members my name is Katie
 
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
Gargano I'm the city clerk in lonia and
 
01:29:53.189 --> 01:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
I contacted representative St Clair
 
01:29:55.669 --> 01:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
about the submission of of this bill
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
when following the Civil forfeiture
 
01:29:59.109 --> 01:29:59.119 align:start position:0%
process we must send notices by
 
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
certified mail or they must be hand
 
01:30:03.310 --> 01:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
delivered in the city of lonia we share
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
an animal control officer with two other
 
01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
communities and when we saw this past
 
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
year we had 300 notices to send the best
 
01:30:12.510 --> 01:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
option was for us to mail
 
01:30:15.629 --> 01:30:15.639 align:start position:0%
them I feel like the requested language
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
is uh the language change is simple over
 
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
the years we're continuously seeing
 
01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
rates increase by the United States
 
01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
Postal Service and I'm trying to cover
 
01:30:26.910 --> 01:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
the municipality's expenses for sending
 
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
out the notices as required by law the
 
01:30:32.109 --> 01:30:32.119 align:start position:0%
City of Laconia licenses approximately
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
2,800 dogs per year generating money for
 
01:30:36.790 --> 01:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture and the
 
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
City of
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
Laconia in 2024 we had to send 300 civil
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
forfeitures which were a cost of
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
$964 per letter but the current RSA
 
01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:51.560 align:start position:0%
allows for us to collect seven so we
 
01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
that's thank you other questions for the
 
01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
speaker representative Walker thank you
 
01:31:09.189 --> 01:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh how much time does your
 
01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:11.800 align:start position:0%
office take to process all these civil
 
01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
forfeitures every
 
01:31:16.669 --> 01:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
year well we have software that takes
 
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
care of understand tracking so it
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
probably takes
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
us a day to prepare the list and we
 
01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
print out the Civil forfeitures um the
 
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
certified mail cards come right out out
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
of our printer and then we just put them
 
01:31:33.790 --> 01:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
on the envelopes and send them out so it
 
01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
probably takes about a
 
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
day as a reminder to committee members
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
this is not a conversation with the
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
witness you are permitted to ask one
 
01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
question and then if you want to say
 
01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
anything additional please indicate that
 
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
you would like to ask a follow-up
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
question other any other
 
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
questions for Ms
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
you next I have M Tina
 
01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
bill my name is Tina Guilford I'm the
 
01:32:26.430 --> 01:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
town clerk in
 
01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
Derry um we have a very similar problem
 
01:32:31.709 --> 01:32:31.719 align:start position:0%
to what Laconia has um we license over
 
01:32:34.830 --> 01:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
7,000 dogs in Dairy and while we do have
 
01:32:39.629 --> 01:32:39.639 align:start position:0%
an animal control officer um in 2023 we
 
01:32:39.639 --> 01:32:43.590 align:start position:0%
an animal control officer um in 2023 we
had

01:32:43.590 --> 01:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:47.709 --> 01:32:47.719 align:start position:0%
1,821 uh unlicensed dogs um in
 
01:32:47.719 --> 01:32:50.510 align:start position:0%
1,821 uh unlicensed dogs um in
2024

01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
2024
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
1,244 unlicensed dogs so we are working
 
01:32:57.870 --> 01:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
on getting our residents to license um
 
01:33:00.189 --> 01:33:00.199 align:start position:0%
however this is quite a bit of money
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
that is being subsidized by other Dairy
 
01:33:05.109 --> 01:33:05.119 align:start position:0%
residents with the cost of the Civil
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
forfeiture because it would be
 
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
impossible by the statutes um for my
 
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
Animal control officer to go to all
 
01:33:16.910 --> 01:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
these doors and post notices by the
 
01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
deadline in
 
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
statute um it does take my office um
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
about 3 4 days to get all the Civil
 
01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:27.550 align:start position:0%
about 3 4 days to get all the Civil
letters

01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:27.560 align:start position:0%
letters
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
out um was like I said 1,200 of them
 
01:33:35.149 --> 01:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
this year and um is quite a bit of money
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
subsidizing by by the
 
01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um all other required um
 
01:33:45.149 --> 01:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
notices that we are required to send by
 
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
certified mail for example tax leans
 
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
nsfs all those things they all have
 
01:33:55.109 --> 01:33:55.119 align:start position:0%
current cost of postage
 
01:34:00.430 --> 01:34:00.440 align:start position:0%
um so this seems like it's uh something
 
01:34:02.590 --> 01:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
relatively simple because if they
 
01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
license their dog on time nobody needs
 
01:34:08.510 --> 01:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
to pay this so this is only for people
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
who do not license and they should be
 
01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
the people paying the
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
freight and I'm happy to take any
 
01:34:17.910 --> 01:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Miss Guilford
 
01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:34.590 --> 01:34:34.600 align:start position:0%

and I fully support
 
01:34:58.990 --> 01:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
hb86 currently the clerks can only
 
01:35:01.109 --> 01:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
recoup $7 from the
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
$8.95 Cent cost to male civil fores
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
notice is as required by RSA
 
01:35:11.149 --> 01:35:11.159 align:start position:0%
46614 Kingston has approximately 1,800
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
dogs last year we
 
01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
sent 145 civil forture letters which
 
01:35:17.790 --> 01:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
cost the town
 
01:35:21.149 --> 01:35:21.159 align:start position:0%
$282 in small towns like Kingston This
 
01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
has an impact on our budget I respect ly
 
01:35:27.390 --> 01:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
ask for your support in amending RSA
 
01:35:30.109 --> 01:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
46614 thank you Miss bakey that was
 
01:35:32.910 --> 01:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
efficient questions for the
 
01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank
 
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
you and the last pink card that I have
 
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
Healey hi uh Dan Healey Nash city clerk
 
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%
um and I support this bill uh so as some
 
01:35:53.950 --> 01:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
of the other clerks that already
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned um the the cost of postage is
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
exceeds the amount that we're able to
 
01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:04.360 align:start position:0%
charge in Nasha we have about
 
01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
10,500 dogs to license each year and I
 
01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
believe last year we had about 2,000
 
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
that required the Civil forfeiture um
 
01:36:16.590 --> 01:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
even after you know trying to get people
 
01:36:18.430 --> 01:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
to come in by email reminders and all
 
01:36:21.229 --> 01:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
that so it ends up costing uh the city
 
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of money uh if we were to
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
all of the Civil forfeitures at that uh
 
01:36:30.030 --> 01:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
current rate so I think uh it's a pretty
 
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
straightforward bill I think uh the
 
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
speakers prior uh all hit on the points
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
that uh we had um I've talked to other
 
01:36:40.830 --> 01:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
clerks and I haven't found a single
 
01:36:43.229 --> 01:36:43.239 align:start position:0%
clerk that disagrees with this bill it's
 
01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
it was sent out to our association and
 
01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
and we only had uh positive feedback for
 
01:36:51.910 --> 01:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
it so you open to any questions thank
 
01:36:54.109 --> 01:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr Healey questions for Mr
 
01:36:58.189 --> 01:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
hle seeing none thank you
 
01:37:00.910 --> 01:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
thanks so that was the last pink card
 
01:37:03.390 --> 01:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
that I had is there anybody present in
 
01:37:05.229 --> 01:37:05.239 align:start position:0%
the room who wishes to speak to this
 
01:37:07.350 --> 01:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
bill who has not had the opportunity to

01:37:13.149 --> 01:37:13.159 align:start position:0%
so seeing none I'm going to close the
 
01:37:13.159 --> 01:37:14.310 align:start position:0%
so seeing none I'm going to close the
hearing

01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:37:22.510 --> 01:37:22.520 align:start position:0%

01:38:07.589 --> 01:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
next on our agenda today we have House
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
Bill 92 I'm going to open the hearing on
 
01:38:14.030 --> 01:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill 92 that's an act prohibiting
 
01:38:16.189 --> 01:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
an individual from SIM
 
01:38:18.510 --> 01:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
simultaneously serving on the local
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
zoning board and planning board and with
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
us this morning we have representative
 
01:38:26.109 --> 01:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
Joe Alexander who is the Prime sponsor
 
01:38:28.229 --> 01:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:38:30.350 --> 01:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
legislation well thank you madam chair
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
members of M fman County for the record
 
01:38:34.229 --> 01:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
my name is representative Joe Alexander
 
01:38:37.550 --> 01:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
I'm I serve the town of goof toown um I
 
01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
filed this bill um to address a
 
01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
perceived conflict of interest that
 
01:38:44.430 --> 01:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
could arise on the or not conflict of
 
01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
interest but separation of powers
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
argument that could arise on the local
 
01:38:51.310 --> 01:38:51.320 align:start position:0%
level um it's a bipartisan bill it's on
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
behalf of one of my constituents
 
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
actually um to address a perceived
 
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
separation of powers under the current
 
01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
law and some municipalities one can run
 
01:38:59.790 --> 01:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
for Planning and Zoning Board and serve
 
01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
at the same time um My Hope Is that
 
01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee can see where
 
01:39:06.270 --> 01:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
this can be a conflict I believe when a
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
member of the public appeals a local
 
01:39:09.709 --> 01:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
decision of the planning board to the
 
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
zoning board they should be able to
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
appeal it to an entirely new committee
 
01:39:16.589 --> 01:39:16.599 align:start position:0%
made up of new officials and I had OS do
 
01:39:19.149 --> 01:39:19.159 align:start position:0%
some research and um to my surprise the
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
last time this bill was filed was 1993
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
so I was not alive at the time
 
01:39:29.070 --> 01:39:29.080 align:start position:0%
um HB 299 L um in 1993 was recommended
 
01:39:30.910 --> 01:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
itl U because the committee felt there
 
01:39:32.229 --> 01:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
was already a mechanism on the local
 
01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:35.679 align:start position:0%
level to address the issue um although
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
some towns or some municipalities um
 
01:39:40.589 --> 01:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
this is still possible so I think that
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
Statewide we should make it a policy
 
01:39:44.709 --> 01:39:44.719 align:start position:0%
that if you're going to run for one of
 
01:39:46.109 --> 01:39:46.119 align:start position:0%
the boards you serve on one board and
 
01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
not the other um I believe we need a
 
01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
Statewide approach this law we
 
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
consistently know each M municipality um
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
has separation of powers member can rest
 
01:39:57.870 --> 01:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
assured that their appeal of a planning
 
01:39:59.470 --> 01:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
board decision will be conducted fairly
 
01:40:01.629 --> 01:40:01.639 align:start position:0%
and impartially um with new membership
 
01:40:03.189 --> 01:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
so I hope you'll look favorably on this
 
01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
committee U my constituent is here to
 
01:40:06.750 --> 01:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
testify as well but I'm happy to answer
 
01:40:08.510 --> 01:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
questions but I I think this pretty
 
01:40:10.149 --> 01:40:10.159 align:start position:0%
straightforward famous last words I
 
01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
think people say that a lot so thank you
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander questions for
 
01:40:16.990 --> 01:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
the prime
 
01:40:19.109 --> 01:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
Dolan thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:40:24.510 --> 01:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my my question
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
the uh your comments seem to indicate
 
01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
that this would apply only to planning
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
board and Zoning Board elected positions
 
01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
what about those communities where those
 
01:40:38.910 --> 01:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
positions are not elected that they're
 
01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
appointed what's the intersection in
 
01:40:43.709 --> 01:40:43.719 align:start position:0%
that in that uh
 
01:40:46.750 --> 01:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
situation um this would apply to it says
 
01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
any pointed or elected members it would
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
apply to both in the law the Bas based
 
01:40:54.629 --> 01:40:54.639 align:start position:0%
on how the bill is written thank you yep
 
01:40:56.910 --> 01:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative
 
01:40:59.470 --> 01:40:59.480 align:start position:0%
frock thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative in your
 
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
opinion would
 
01:41:08.189 --> 01:41:08.199 align:start position:0%
requiring recusal from a hearing on the
 
01:41:12.270 --> 01:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
second board serve the same
 
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
purpose um I think it could and and this
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
is in the committee's hand to make that
 
01:41:19.390 --> 01:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
decision um I think there's already me
 
01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:21.679 align:start position:0%
there's already parts of the RSA where
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
members can't serve on two boards so for
 
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
instance I serve on the gtown budget
 
01:41:27.149 --> 01:41:27.159 align:start position:0%
committee as well I would not be allowed
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
to serve on the budget committee and the
 
01:41:30.430 --> 01:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
select board unless I was the select
 
01:41:32.229 --> 01:41:32.239 align:start position:0%
board appointee to the budget committee
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
so there's already mechanisms in the RSA
 
01:41:36.910 --> 01:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
to address some of these perceived like
 
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
um separation of powers arguments so um
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
we can be consistent and do the Planning
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
and Zoning Board because they're they
 
01:41:45.510 --> 01:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
conflict with each other or um we can do
 
01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
what you suggest but I think this is
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
particularly valid as
 
01:41:51.990 --> 01:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your response you're
 
01:41:55.870 --> 01:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:57.550 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:41:57.550 --> 01:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:42:00.070 --> 01:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
Elward thank you madam chairman thank
 
01:42:03.629 --> 01:42:03.639 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I'm
 
01:42:07.870 --> 01:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
confused the um sentence
 
01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:11.639 align:start position:0%
preceding uh the amendment starting on
 
01:42:11.639 --> 01:42:15.149 align:start position:0%
preceding uh the amendment starting on
line

01:42:15.149 --> 01:42:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
8 it I believe it is
 
01:42:22.830 --> 01:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
saying that you can serve on a planning
 
01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:24.270 align:start position:0%
saying that you can serve on a planning
board

01:42:24.270 --> 01:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:42:27.709 --> 01:42:27.719 align:start position:0%
board and a local land use board is
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA 672 colon
 
01:42:34.830 --> 01:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
7 so when you go to the
 
01:42:37.189 --> 01:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
definition planning board and zoning
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:45.589 --> 01:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
board so am I you know my dyslexia
 
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
getting to me but is it not conflicting
 
01:42:53.310 --> 01:42:53.320 align:start position:0%
with the amended language thank you I I
 
01:42:54.270 --> 01:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
 
01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:55.679 align:start position:0%
representative I don't think it is
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
because it's saying any two appointed or
 
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
elected members of a board so planning
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
board cannot Also Serve together on
 
01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
another board um they also address the
 
01:43:10.669 --> 01:43:10.679 align:start position:0%
conflict of the conflict on um
 
01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission as well so I
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
don't I think it's pretty clear in that
 
01:43:15.119 --> 01:43:17.950 align:start position:0%
don't I think it's pretty clear in that
language

01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
but I that's what I got for you okay
 
01:43:25.589 --> 01:43:25.599 align:start position:0%
thank you y additional
 
01:43:29.669 --> 01:43:29.679 align:start position:0%
questions I have one go ahead for
 
01:43:33.870 --> 01:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
clarification um let me just back up so
 
01:43:36.030 --> 01:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
when when a bill is before this
 
01:43:38.589 --> 01:43:38.599 align:start position:0%
committee and we have a hearing members
 
01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
we we are to focus on the the bolded
 
01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
italicized language because that's the
 
01:43:47.629 --> 01:43:47.639 align:start position:0%
change that's being made we um typically
 
01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
don't concern ourselves with the other
 
01:43:52.709 --> 01:43:52.719 align:start position:0%
language that appears printed in in the
 
01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:55.239 align:start position:0%
bill but I do understand that
 
01:43:57.589 --> 01:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
representative Elward this is a little
 
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
bit of a gray area so my question would
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
be um with regards to the lines that she
 
01:44:07.070 --> 01:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
indicated there's the local land use
 
01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
board um perhaps if you could
 
01:44:14.310 --> 01:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
clarify what are local land use boards
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
could you name them and and list them um
 
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
from what I know there's three there's
 
01:44:21.910 --> 01:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
planning board zoning board and
 
01:44:26.189 --> 01:44:26.199 align:start position:0%
conservation commissions so um I I mean
 
01:44:28.270 --> 01:44:28.280 align:start position:0%
again this is part of the bill so this
 
01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
is Madame chairwoman this bill is in
 
01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
your hands so um if you'd like to
 
01:44:34.709 --> 01:44:34.719 align:start position:0%
address other parts of the RSA um feel
 
01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:36.639 align:start position:0%
free but I think you understand what the
 
01:44:39.070 --> 01:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
intent of me sponsoring this bill was so
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll keep that as
 
01:44:46.270 --> 01:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:49.790 --> 01:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative um Gilman thank
 
01:44:52.350 --> 01:44:52.360 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um my question having
 
01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
served on on a zoning board um is do you
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
see this affecting the towns and like
 
01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
mine that have trouble um we don't have
 
01:45:07.790 --> 01:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
an elected um planning board or zoning
 
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
board do you see they're being trouble
 
01:45:14.030 --> 01:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
attracting um volunteers to fit the
 
01:45:16.629 --> 01:45:16.639 align:start position:0%
empty spots and that this is one way to
 
01:45:19.109 --> 01:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
help us fill those spots um thank you
 
01:45:20.350 --> 01:45:20.360 align:start position:0%
for the question representative I think
 
01:45:21.790 --> 01:45:21.800 align:start position:0%
it's an important point to make and I
 
01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
think I think you're right that are
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes Town boards that struggle to
 
01:45:27.629 --> 01:45:27.639 align:start position:0%
find memberships they have appointed
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
mechanism they have a mechanism to
 
01:45:31.310 --> 01:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
appoint members in those cases but I
 
01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
also really think that although there
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
may be trouble the separation of powers
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
argument is more important than the
 
01:45:39.709 --> 01:45:39.719 align:start position:0%
trouble they're going to find maybe with
 
01:45:42.990 --> 01:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
a member or something um I think that
 
01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
part of the reason why we're in the
 
01:45:46.830 --> 01:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
housing crisis we are in right now is
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
that we'll have members of One board and
 
01:45:51.070 --> 01:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
then another board and maybe there's a
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
rejection to an application planning
 
01:45:54.430 --> 01:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
board appeal it to the zoning board and
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
they see the same faces so I just I I
 
01:45:59.070 --> 01:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
the the conflict is more important than
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
maybe finding the membership because
 
01:46:06.629 --> 01:46:06.639 align:start position:0%
there are mechanisms to appoint members
 
01:46:08.669 --> 01:46:08.679 align:start position:0%
of the public in those cases thank you
 
01:46:10.189 --> 01:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
follow up Madam
 
01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
chair yes thank you uh so to further
 
01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
that out U most of the land use com uh
 
01:46:20.589 --> 01:46:20.599 align:start position:0%
boards and you forgot the HDC and the
 
01:46:24.350 --> 01:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
Heritage commission um which um have a
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
select board representative on them or
 
01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh like the HDC has a Heritage
 
01:46:31.709 --> 01:46:31.719 align:start position:0%
commission member vice versa and it's a
 
01:46:34.189 --> 01:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
cross-pollination kind of thing do do
 
01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
you see that it may help a zoning board
 
01:46:43.310 --> 01:46:43.320 align:start position:0%
to have a planning board member to um
 
01:46:45.870 --> 01:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
explain how they came to their decision
 
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
or vice versa I the bill is in your
 
01:46:51.550 --> 01:46:51.560 align:start position:0%
hands um I think you understand what my
 
01:46:53.589 --> 01:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
intent with it is um
 
01:46:55.470 --> 01:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
I that's a good point that we have
 
01:46:57.950 --> 01:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
select board members on the budget
 
01:46:59.870 --> 01:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
committee and their voting members and
 
01:47:01.149 --> 01:47:01.159 align:start position:0%
and so if there's a planning board
 
01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative or something like that
 
01:47:03.790 --> 01:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
that's completely valid whether you want
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
to make that member a voting member or
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
not that's entirely up to you but um
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
that's a good point Thank
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:18.310 --> 01:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:47:21.629 --> 01:47:21.639 align:start position:0%
Elward thank you madam chairman my
 
01:47:24.790 --> 01:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
question is if this law goes into effect
 
01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:25.830 align:start position:0%
question is if this law goes into effect
as

01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
written what happens to the board
 
01:47:31.709 --> 01:47:31.719 align:start position:0%
members that are serving on both boards
 
01:47:34.870 --> 01:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
do they automatically
 
01:47:38.229 --> 01:47:38.239 align:start position:0%
resign what if there's no Quorum left
 
01:47:40.109 --> 01:47:40.119 align:start position:0%
have you thought about the ramifications
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
of that um I have and I I think that in
 
01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
cases where there's changes to Municipal
 
01:47:49.550 --> 01:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
law um there's associations that inform
 
01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
um different communities of the changes
 
01:47:53.109 --> 01:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
so Municipal Association I'm sure will
 
01:47:55.709 --> 01:47:55.719 align:start position:0%
testify on this um if this La law would
 
01:47:57.030 --> 01:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
go into effect they would notify the
 
01:47:58.430 --> 01:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
towns and the towns would deal with that
 
01:48:01.709 --> 01:48:01.719 align:start position:0%
accordingly um again there's appointed
 
01:48:03.589 --> 01:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
members of boards that can fill
 
01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
vacancies of elected officials until the
 
01:48:07.669 --> 01:48:07.679 align:start position:0%
next town election comes up and then we
 
01:48:09.589 --> 01:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
can elect a new new person to fulfill
 
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
the rest of that term that's how I see
 
01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
it um playing out you're
 
01:48:18.070 --> 01:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
welcome any further questions seeing
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:33.669 --> 01:48:33.679 align:start position:0%
so um I have one final pink card from Mr
 
01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
Phil J jro you have indicated five
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
minutes and I would kindly ask if you
 
01:48:44.030 --> 01:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
could um do it in three or less and if
 
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
you have something written or you have
 
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
more to say feel free to email that to
 
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:06.229 --> 01:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
RS yeah about the recusal I found that
 
01:49:11.390 --> 01:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
does not happen I approached the town to
 
01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
put some signs up and they said no I
 
01:49:16.109 --> 01:49:16.119 align:start position:0%
could not put two signs up because the
 
01:49:18.709 --> 01:49:18.719 align:start position:0%
ordinance says I'm only allowed one sign
 
01:49:20.669 --> 01:49:20.679 align:start position:0%
and I said this is political sign this
 
01:49:23.109 --> 01:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
is to petition the government I was
 
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
basically wanting to protest against a
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
project the zoning board gave permission
 
01:49:33.430 --> 01:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
to next to my property and I hear a
 
01:49:36.030 --> 01:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
247 buzzing and humming from this
 
01:49:38.430 --> 01:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
project for two and a half
 
01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
years okay so now they're concerned that
 
01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
my putting two signs up is going to
 
01:49:49.189 --> 01:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
devaluate other people's property when
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
my property is being devaluated but they
 
01:49:52.709 --> 01:49:52.719 align:start position:0%
see no problem with that the witness
 
01:49:56.030 --> 01:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
shall suspend um Mr juru it's it's not
 
01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
clear to me that your testimony is
 
01:50:01.310 --> 01:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
relative to the changes in the bill this
 
01:50:03.390 --> 01:50:03.400 align:start position:0%
is some background information with
 
01:50:07.470 --> 01:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
regards to town politics I ask that you
 
01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
focus okay your comments
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
to if you support the proposed amendment
 
01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
to this RSA through this Bill thank you
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
okay well my point was basically the
 
01:50:24.189 --> 01:50:24.199 align:start position:0%
chairman of the uh zoning board who sits
 
01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
on the planning board see saw nothing
 
01:50:29.470 --> 01:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
wrong with the rec cruising themselves
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
they saw no conflict of interest even
 
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
though they were involved with the
 
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
planning board when the sign ordinances
 
01:50:40.589 --> 01:50:40.599 align:start position:0%
were being amended and enacted now I
 
01:50:42.990 --> 01:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
brought this to court and the judge saw
 
01:50:45.870 --> 01:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with this and he didn't
 
01:50:48.149 --> 01:50:48.159 align:start position:0%
even you know I mean that's kind of
 
01:50:48.159 --> 01:50:49.669 align:start position:0%
even you know I mean that's kind of
bizarre

01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
bizarre
 
01:50:52.669 --> 01:50:52.679 align:start position:0%
because here you have a planning board
 
01:50:56.069 --> 01:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
defending their own zoning board now
 
01:50:59.709 --> 01:50:59.719 align:start position:0%
this comes basically to your question
 
01:51:01.550 --> 01:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
um let me see how that
 
01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:15.189 --> 01:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
here was it about um finding volunteers
 
01:51:21.229 --> 01:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
um repres
 
01:51:28.030 --> 01:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
presentation let me go I'll stop back
 
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
that basically the chairman of the
 
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
joning board I got this one
 
01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
here and the um on the planning board
 
01:51:42.109 --> 01:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
the judge saw nothing wrong with that
 
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
and this is a an ordinance that they're
 
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
involved with enacting so basically this
 
01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
is kind of like a judge being involved
 
01:51:53.149 --> 01:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
with the enact
 
01:51:54.589 --> 01:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
legislation and then going around and
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
making a ruling on the legislation they
 
01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
were involved with that's what this
 
01:52:03.470 --> 01:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
comes down to this is the separation of
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
power I mean how can you be a judge
 
01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
because if you look at the
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
ordinances or the statutes for why a
 
01:52:13.109 --> 01:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
zoning board is defined or why it's
 
01:52:16.510 --> 01:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
enacted it's the it's for constitutional
 
01:52:18.910 --> 01:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
protection for the people at the Town
 
01:52:21.629 --> 01:52:21.639 align:start position:0%
level so the zoning board can hear these
 
01:52:24.149 --> 01:52:24.159 align:start position:0%
complaints address these complaints on
 
01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
the local level without having to go to
 
01:52:29.589 --> 01:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
the state level first but now in this
 
01:52:32.790 --> 01:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
case here you're going and you're saying
 
01:52:34.830 --> 01:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
okay well now I'm facing the person that
 
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
passed the law and was all for this law
 
01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
and he's the judge well the person is
 
01:52:41.069 --> 01:52:41.079 align:start position:0%
the judge not necessarily he because it
 
01:52:44.350 --> 01:52:44.360 align:start position:0%
was a she and how are you going to
 
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
defend yourself against
 
01:52:49.629 --> 01:52:49.639 align:start position:0%
that I mean it's it's ridiculous and
 
01:52:51.550 --> 01:52:51.560 align:start position:0%
this is what happened I can I mean in my
 
01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
test I don't have the 20 here I think it
 
01:52:57.550 --> 01:52:57.560 align:start position:0%
was 20 of you my printer uh started
 
01:53:00.870 --> 01:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
fading out but I can pass it out some
 
01:53:02.430 --> 01:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
but I mean your zoning board is
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
basically established to listen to
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
complaints on zoning ordinances that's
 
01:53:11.669 --> 01:53:11.679 align:start position:0%
what your statute says you can't enact a
 
01:53:13.629 --> 01:53:13.639 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance without first
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
establishing a zoning board so how are
 
01:53:19.270 --> 01:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
you sitting there passing these laws are
 
01:53:21.310 --> 01:53:21.320 align:start position:0%
involved with the writing of the laws
 
01:53:23.629 --> 01:53:23.639 align:start position:0%
while you're also interp ing these laws
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
and that's the whole point to this thing
 
01:53:27.550 --> 01:53:27.560 align:start position:0%
it's just common sense to separate the
 
01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
powers because this is what happened
 
01:53:31.870 --> 01:53:31.880 align:start position:0%
already and the judge saw nothing wrong
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
with it the you know the the personing
 
01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
on the zoning board saw nothing wrong
 
01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
with it who's to Define what a conflict
 
01:53:40.510 --> 01:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
of interest is and in this state
 
01:53:42.189 --> 01:53:42.199 align:start position:0%
basically a conflict of interest means
 
01:53:44.430 --> 01:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
if there's money involved okay and not
 
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily when our rights are being
 
01:53:48.589 --> 01:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
taken away and deprived that also can be
 
01:53:50.830 --> 01:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
a conflict of interest and that's a user
 
01:53:53.149 --> 01:53:53.159 align:start position:0%
of power basically
 
01:53:56.030 --> 01:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr jeru I'll any questions
 
01:53:59.069 --> 01:53:59.079 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr
 
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
giru seeing none I appreciate you taking
 
01:54:05.149 --> 01:54:05.159 align:start position:0%
the time to provide your testimony and
 
01:54:09.069 --> 01:54:09.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:11.870 --> 01:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
yes so like I said that was the last
 
01:54:14.189 --> 01:54:14.199 align:start position:0%
card is there anybody present in the
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
room who wishes to speak on this bill
 
01:54:20.589 --> 01:54:20.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:37.629 --> 01:54:37.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:42.589 --> 01:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:48.430 --> 01:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
101 okay okay okay so seeing that I have
 
01:54:50.229 --> 01:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
no other pin cards I'm going to close
 
01:55:36.550 --> 01:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:38.719 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your patience this
 
01:55:42.990 --> 01:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
chair has um not predicted the length of
 
01:55:46.270 --> 01:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
bills very well so we are a little bit
 
01:55:49.470 --> 01:55:49.480 align:start position:0%
behind here but I would like to um hold
 
01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
the hearing on House Bill 99 here before
 
01:55:55.229 --> 01:55:55.239 align:start position:0%
we take a lunch break I have three pink
 
01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
cards and I will ask that um people
 
01:56:04.510 --> 01:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
who speak to this bill would limit their
 
01:56:08.350 --> 01:56:08.360 align:start position:0%
comments to 3 minutes or less so at this
 
01:56:10.830 --> 01:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
time I would like to open the hearing on
 
01:56:14.669 --> 01:56:14.679 align:start position:0%
House Bill 99 relative to a waiver from
 
01:56:18.430 --> 01:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
property taxes for disable veterans and
 
01:56:22.510 --> 01:56:22.520 align:start position:0%

01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
bill to introduce this legislation to
 
01:56:28.750 --> 01:56:28.760 align:start position:0%

01:56:37.629 --> 01:56:37.639 align:start position:0%
taking this up for the record my name is
 
01:56:39.790 --> 01:56:39.800 align:start position:0%
Mike Moffett uh representing marac
 
01:56:41.750 --> 01:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
District 4 in the beautiful towns of
 
01:56:44.189 --> 01:56:44.199 align:start position:0%
londondary not London Lowden and
 
01:56:46.430 --> 01:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
Canterbury Lowden and Canterbury I
 
01:56:48.430 --> 01:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
submitted this measure at the request of
 
01:56:51.589 --> 01:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
a veteran a couple veterans actually and
 
01:56:53.310 --> 01:56:53.320 align:start position:0%
as you know I chair the house committee
 
01:56:54.990 --> 01:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
on state federal relations the the
 
01:56:58.470 --> 01:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
veterans committee and I try to make we
 
01:57:01.430 --> 01:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
try to make veterans issues and requests
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh get to the appropriate attention in
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
various venues and platforms and
 
01:57:09.149 --> 01:57:09.159 align:start position:0%
committees so uh
 
01:57:12.030 --> 01:57:12.040 align:start position:0%
hb99 uh is about as succinct as you'll
 
01:57:14.830 --> 01:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
ever see as you can see it's very short
 
01:57:18.830 --> 01:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
it changes the relevant line in irsa 72
 
01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:20.109 align:start position:0%
it changes the relevant line in irsa 72
colon

01:57:20.109 --> 01:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
colon
 
01:57:23.589 --> 01:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
27 to make the highend of a potential
 
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
disabled veterans uh tax credit to be
 
01:57:31.310 --> 01:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
100% of the local property tax as
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
opposed to $700 which is what it is now
 
01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:35.550 align:start position:0%
opposed to $700 which is what it is now
in

01:57:35.550 --> 01:57:35.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:57:38.589 --> 01:57:38.599 align:start position:0%
statute now I I must say am very aware
 
01:57:41.830 --> 01:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
as you are the tax credit measures can
 
01:57:44.510 --> 01:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
be a little bit tricky uh in the sense
 
01:57:46.709 --> 01:57:46.719 align:start position:0%
that we all know
 
01:57:50.750 --> 01:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh need to raise revenues
 
01:57:53.310 --> 01:57:53.320 align:start position:0%
obviously and
 
01:57:54.669 --> 01:57:54.679 align:start position:0%
they need these revenues to run
 
01:57:56.589 --> 01:57:56.599 align:start position:0%
everything that they need to run so
 
01:57:59.430 --> 01:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
Revenue shortfalls can be created by tax
 
01:58:03.950 --> 01:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
credits for some um and and you all know
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
that so it's important to point out that
 
01:58:09.629 --> 01:58:09.639 align:start position:0%
this is enabling
 
01:58:12.270 --> 01:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
legislation uh it involves no
 
01:58:15.390 --> 01:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
mandates should it move forward uh it
 
01:58:17.669 --> 01:58:17.679 align:start position:0%
could be adopted by municipality should
 
01:58:19.270 --> 01:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
this move forward it could be adopted or
 
01:58:21.709 --> 01:58:21.719 align:start position:0%
utilized by a municipality or not it's
 
01:58:24.589 --> 01:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
the nature of enable enabling
 
01:58:27.510 --> 01:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
legislation um for example say the good
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
folks in any Town New Hampshire know
 
01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
that their neighbor Mr Jones who is
 
01:58:35.470 --> 01:58:35.480 align:start position:0%
totally disabled due to injury suffered
 
01:58:38.750 --> 01:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
in Afghanistan simply can't afford to
 
01:58:42.109 --> 01:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
pay his property taxes and will have to
 
01:58:44.709 --> 01:58:44.719 align:start position:0%
give up his home and and leave leave any
 
01:58:47.149 --> 01:58:47.159 align:start position:0%
town uh for some other living
 
01:58:49.310 --> 01:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
Arrangement so the local officials
 
01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:51.400 align:start position:0%
should this pass the local officials in
 
01:58:54.629 --> 01:58:54.639 align:start position:0%
any town would have the option of giving
 
01:58:57.470 --> 01:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
Mr Jones a break so he can stay in his
 
01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
home and in the any town
 
01:59:02.709 --> 01:59:02.719 align:start position:0%
community uh that's the essence of this
 
01:59:05.310 --> 01:59:05.320 align:start position:0%
proposal so the question will arise as
 
01:59:08.750 --> 01:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
to documenting what quote service
 
01:59:12.910 --> 01:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
connected total disability unquote means
 
01:59:15.510 --> 01:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
what what it entails and the easy answer
 
01:59:18.189 --> 01:59:18.199 align:start position:0%
would be that it in involves producing
 
01:59:22.750 --> 01:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
official VA certification to medical
 
01:59:25.709 --> 01:59:25.719 align:start position:0%
certification to confirm such a status
 
01:59:29.910 --> 01:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
of 100% disability service related
 
01:59:33.950 --> 01:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
disability uh much the same way that a
 
01:59:37.550 --> 01:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
DD214 document confirms a veteran status
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
for veterans seeking consideration for
 
01:59:43.149 --> 01:59:43.159 align:start position:0%
for existing local property tax credit
 
01:59:45.109 --> 01:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
options many many communities in the
 
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
State uh do this already for veterans uh
 
01:59:52.069 --> 01:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
some to to a limit some do more than
 
01:59:54.229 --> 01:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
others and it's up to the community if
 
01:59:56.990 --> 01:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
they want to offer the uh tax credit
 
01:59:59.310 --> 01:59:59.320 align:start position:0%
option now for veterans the veteran
 
02:00:01.629 --> 02:00:01.639 align:start position:0%
simply needs to document his status via
 
02:00:04.589 --> 02:00:04.599 align:start position:0%
that document the
 
02:00:08.069 --> 02:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
DD214 so there are a lot of issues
 
02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
surrounding aspects relating to 100%
 
02:00:13.109 --> 02:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
disability status in terms of employment
 
02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
grants dependence and on and on but I
 
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
don't know that those other issues
 
02:00:21.390 --> 02:00:21.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily relate to this very simple
 
02:00:24.870 --> 02:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
Bill and this this very tiny change or
 
02:00:27.189 --> 02:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
enhancement to the existing
 
02:00:30.750 --> 02:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
statute uh representative sudder is here
 
02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
and he and I spoke about his concerns
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
that this measure could impact the
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
status of certain grants for Home
 
02:00:38.910 --> 02:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
Improvements for totally disabled
 
02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
veterans I'm not sure how well founded
 
02:00:43.950 --> 02:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
his concerns are we've we've discussed
 
02:00:46.390 --> 02:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
those uh in representative sud here and
 
02:00:48.390 --> 02:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
he can speak briefly to those to that
 
02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
possible aspect later his concern that
 
02:00:55.229 --> 02:00:55.239 align:start position:0%
100% um tax credit could impact other
 
02:00:57.629 --> 02:00:57.639 align:start position:0%
things uh and you all are the duty
 
02:01:00.390 --> 02:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
experts on this I'm sure you'll um work
 
02:01:03.109 --> 02:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
through that uh again my sense is his
 
02:01:05.149 --> 02:01:05.159 align:start position:0%
concerns may be unfounded given the
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
simple intent of this measure but again
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
as I just said uh you not Al the bill
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
and and are the uh as we say in the the
 
02:01:16.189 --> 02:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
Marine Corps the duty experts in this in
 
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
this field so again thank you for all
 
02:01:20.709 --> 02:01:20.719 align:start position:0%
you do that's the bill and I'd be happy
 
02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
to try to answer any questions if if
 
02:01:24.390 --> 02:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
there are any thank you representative
 
02:01:26.750 --> 02:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
Moffett questions for the prime sponsor
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative Walker thank you madam
 
02:01:32.430 --> 02:01:32.440 align:start position:0%
chair I'm a little confused here if a
 
02:01:35.950 --> 02:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
town so chooses to en enact this
 
02:01:39.189 --> 02:01:39.199 align:start position:0%
legislation your thing do they act say
 
02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
they wanted to do the 100% so they act
 
02:01:43.950 --> 02:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to do the 100% is that
 
02:01:46.189 --> 02:01:46.199 align:start position:0%
individually or all of them so in other
 
02:01:49.390 --> 02:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
words if Mr Jones comes up and asks
 
02:01:51.430 --> 02:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
specifically for that does the town have
 
02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:53.149 align:start position:0%
specifically for that does the town have
to

02:01:53.149 --> 02:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:01:55.270 --> 02:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
vote on that or is it automatically a
 
02:01:58.030 --> 02:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
blanket for all that thank you repres
 
02:01:59.870 --> 02:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's a great question it's one that I've
 
02:02:02.109 --> 02:02:02.119 align:start position:0%
pondered and thought about and and the
 
02:02:04.109 --> 02:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
answer is uh if this enabling
 
02:02:06.790 --> 02:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
legislation were to pass through uh I
 
02:02:10.350 --> 02:02:10.360 align:start position:0%
would like to see the communities that
 
02:02:13.870 --> 02:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
uh decide to uh adopt it have some
 
02:02:16.950 --> 02:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
mechanism to address the situation you
 
02:02:19.830 --> 02:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
described um and I'm not entirely clear
 
02:02:22.189 --> 02:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
on If This Were to move forward if it
 
02:02:23.350 --> 02:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
would be a
 
02:02:26.830 --> 02:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
blanket uh adoption as you said and and
 
02:02:28.510 --> 02:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
the reason that I've thought about this
 
02:02:30.709 --> 02:02:30.719 align:start position:0%
and and and it's a great question is
 
02:02:31.709 --> 02:02:31.719 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
some uh veteran circumstances that are
 
02:02:36.830 --> 02:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
more compelling than others I gave the
 
02:02:39.550 --> 02:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
example of Mr Jones in any town which I
 
02:02:42.229 --> 02:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
think is a a compelling example uh any
 
02:02:44.510 --> 02:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
town by the way is a smaller Community
 
02:02:46.589 --> 02:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
but say nashal manchest not everybody
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
knows everybody in in those
 
02:02:52.750 --> 02:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities and they in evitably is a
 
02:02:55.149 --> 02:02:55.159 align:start position:0%
spectrum and there may be some totally
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
dis dis uh disabled veterans whose
 
02:03:00.430 --> 02:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances are not so dire and people
 
02:03:03.390 --> 02:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
in the community know that so as to
 
02:03:04.950 --> 02:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
whether the
 
02:03:07.069 --> 02:03:07.079 align:start position:0%
community in the in the municipal
 
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
officials within the community would
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
have some discretion to uh focus on a
 
02:03:15.550 --> 02:03:15.560 align:start position:0%
compelling disabled veteran as opposed
 
02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
to someone who's not as compelling I'm
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
not sure that answer great question and
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
um I uh hopefully uh you'll figure it
 
02:03:24.390 --> 02:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
out that that is a great question and
 
02:03:27.030 --> 02:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
and it's one that concerns me as
 
02:03:29.229 --> 02:03:29.239 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative the answer
 
02:03:31.830 --> 02:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
to the question is that if this were to
 
02:03:35.189 --> 02:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
become law and it's changed it would be
 
02:03:38.069 --> 02:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
um appear on the warrant at the town and
 
02:03:40.109 --> 02:03:40.119 align:start position:0%
the legislative body would would vote
 
02:03:42.549 --> 02:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
upon it and therefore if it passed it
 
02:03:46.709 --> 02:03:46.719 align:start position:0%
would apply to all uh veterans who
 
02:03:49.149 --> 02:03:49.159 align:start position:0%
qualify under the language of this
 
02:03:50.350 --> 02:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
section of
 
02:03:52.830 --> 02:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
Statute the the town would not be voting
 
02:03:56.189 --> 02:03:56.199 align:start position:0%
on individual
 
02:03:58.669 --> 02:03:58.679 align:start position:0%
veterans I see representative Dolan has
 
02:04:01.669 --> 02:04:01.679 align:start position:0%
a question thank you madam chair uh
 
02:04:03.510 --> 02:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative MAF thank you for taking
 
02:04:07.030 --> 02:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
my question um as I read this
 
02:04:10.189 --> 02:04:10.199 align:start position:0%
change it gives the
 
02:04:13.830 --> 02:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
community U the option of
 
02:04:16.270 --> 02:04:16.280 align:start position:0%
voting to increase the
 
02:04:18.549 --> 02:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
amount as it says in the legislation
 
02:04:18.559 --> 02:04:19.669 align:start position:0%
amount as it says in the legislation
from

02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
$700 up to 100% so up to it could be 80%
 
02:04:27.310 --> 02:04:27.320 align:start position:0%
or could be 90% it doesn't have to be
 
02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
blanket 100% across the community it can
 
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
be whatever the community decides it can
 
02:04:35.069 --> 02:04:35.079 align:start position:0%
afford when you when you're doing these
 
02:04:39.470 --> 02:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
types of tax credits you take $100 from
 
02:04:41.549 --> 02:04:41.559 align:start position:0%
one person that has to be made up by
 
02:04:44.069 --> 02:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
$100 from the other person so the
 
02:04:48.189 --> 02:04:48.199 align:start position:0%
community can do an a financial analysis
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
and says that this year we can afford to
 
02:04:52.669 --> 02:04:52.679 align:start position:0%
go to 80% or this year we can afford to
 
02:04:56.669 --> 02:04:56.679 align:start position:0%
go to 90% so it doesn't automatically be
 
02:04:58.669 --> 02:04:58.679 align:start position:0%
100% is that am I reading that right
 
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question rep do that
 
02:05:02.390 --> 02:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
is another great question and that issue
 
02:05:05.709 --> 02:05:05.719 align:start position:0%
has come up as to uh discretion in terms
 
02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
of if this was were to move forward
 
02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
would the municipality if they adopted
 
02:05:13.870 --> 02:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
it have discretion in terms of the
 
02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
situation you just described did they
 
02:05:19.470 --> 02:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
have to go to uh uh 100% of the tax
 
02:05:21.950 --> 02:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
value as opposed to the 700 limit that
 
02:05:25.750 --> 02:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
is there now um in putting this in there
 
02:05:27.870 --> 02:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
was a suggestion that rather than have
 
02:05:32.270 --> 02:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
100% which can varies right now the $700
 
02:05:34.709 --> 02:05:34.719 align:start position:0%
or the $500 is consistent across the
 
02:05:36.990 --> 02:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
board for every veteran now when you go
 
02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
to 100% which is what this measure
 
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
proposes 100% for Mr Jones could involve
 
02:05:48.229 --> 02:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
a $6,000 tax credit 100% from Mr Smith
 
02:05:51.510 --> 02:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
could involve a $10,000 uh tax credit is
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
is is as you know that prop properties
 
02:05:56.910 --> 02:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
are have different uh valuations so
 
02:05:58.790 --> 02:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's a great question uh maybe Madame
 
02:06:01.750 --> 02:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
chair has answered to this one too uh
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
but that that's a fair question when
 
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
we've thought about and um I'm not sure
 
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
exactly what the answer is or if now
 
02:06:12.470 --> 02:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
that the committee has this bill if if
 
02:06:15.750 --> 02:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
the the measure might be amended to uh
 
02:06:18.270 --> 02:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
address the situation you just
 
02:06:21.069 --> 02:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
described further questions for the
 
02:06:24.149 --> 02:06:24.159 align:start position:0%
Primes spond representative
 
02:06:27.350 --> 02:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
Colby thank you for coming today um how
 
02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
would this change for uh RSA
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
7235 affect the veterans exemption in
 
02:06:37.199 --> 02:06:38.750 align:start position:0%
7235 affect the veterans exemption in
RSA

02:06:38.750 --> 02:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
02:06:42.589 --> 02:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
7236 for a certain disabled veterans
 
02:06:44.629 --> 02:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
what is what would be the difference
 
02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um I don't
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
have that RSA in front of me that's a
 
02:06:52.709 --> 02:06:52.719 align:start position:0%
different line of the same uh RSA 72 too
 
02:06:55.310 --> 02:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
um and I honestly right off top of my
 
02:06:56.830 --> 02:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
head I don't want to try to answer that
 
02:06:58.589 --> 02:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
definitively because I I'm not really
 
02:07:01.589 --> 02:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
sure but I'm sure the answer could could
 
02:07:05.069 --> 02:07:05.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:08.149 --> 02:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
readily does anybody else have question
 
02:07:08.159 --> 02:07:09.629 align:start position:0%
readily does anybody else have question
representative

02:07:09.629 --> 02:07:09.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:07:12.589 --> 02:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
France hi thank you um does that mean
 
02:07:14.750 --> 02:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
the town would adopt a certain
 
02:07:17.990 --> 02:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
percentage if they say for instance they
 
02:07:21.709 --> 02:07:21.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to give you a 70%
 
02:07:24.589 --> 02:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
would that be blanket for any totally
 
02:07:26.990 --> 02:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
disabled ban it would be 70% of their
 
02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:27.870 align:start position:0%
disabled ban it would be 70% of their
tax

02:07:27.870 --> 02:07:27.880 align:start position:0%
tax
 
02:07:29.549 --> 02:07:29.559 align:start position:0%
bill thank you for the question
 
02:07:31.390 --> 02:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
representative if I heard you correctly
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
you asking about a gradation of sorts
 
02:07:37.910 --> 02:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
like if if someone's 70% disabled and
 
02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
the answer is this is very specific uh
 
02:07:45.629 --> 02:07:45.639 align:start position:0%
to 100% so representative Moffet that
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
that was not her question I'm going to
 
02:07:49.629 --> 02:07:49.639 align:start position:0%
allow her to clarify her question so you
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
can answer it thank you you might want
 
02:07:54.990 --> 02:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
to get a little closer okay um the town
 
02:07:59.189 --> 02:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
needs to adopt this policy um the my
 
02:08:01.109 --> 02:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
hearing eight is at the VA I'm
 
02:08:08.310 --> 02:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:12.430 --> 02:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
policy um so the town needs to adopt a
 
02:08:15.669 --> 02:08:15.679 align:start position:0%
policy they e they go from anywhere from
 
02:08:20.030 --> 02:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
$71 up to 100% of the uh person's tax
 
02:08:23.510 --> 02:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
bill can they does the town could the
 
02:08:25.830 --> 02:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
does the town adopt like say they decide
 
02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:27.310 align:start position:0%
does the town adopt like say they decide
on

02:08:27.310 --> 02:08:27.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:08:29.950 --> 02:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
70% of the tax bill would that be
 
02:08:32.950 --> 02:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
blanket that would just be their policy
 
02:08:34.910 --> 02:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
that uh I oh thank you I think I
 
02:08:37.270 --> 02:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
understand what your question is so you
 
02:08:38.589 --> 02:08:38.599 align:start position:0%
wondering if the town might have
 
02:08:44.310 --> 02:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
discretion to uh not go to 100% but go
 
02:08:47.149 --> 02:08:47.159 align:start position:0%
to a different percentage or a fixed
 
02:08:48.589 --> 02:08:48.599 align:start position:0%
cost I I touched on that a little bit
 
02:08:50.510 --> 02:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
earlier about the notion of a fixed a
 
02:08:53.109 --> 02:08:53.119 align:start position:0%
fixed amount as opposed to the 100%
 
02:08:55.470 --> 02:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
which varies uh that's a great question
 
02:08:57.270 --> 02:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
and as to whether the municipality would
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
have the discretion if this passes to uh
 
02:09:03.030 --> 02:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
opt for something less than
 
02:09:06.390 --> 02:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
100% um great question and I'm not clear
 
02:09:09.470 --> 02:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
on if the municipality would have
 
02:09:13.030 --> 02:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
discretion to uh to go less than 100% or
 
02:09:15.069 --> 02:09:15.079 align:start position:0%
to a fixed amount that that's a a great
 
02:09:17.390 --> 02:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
question and and I'm not clear at this
 
02:09:18.870 --> 02:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
moment on what the answer would be but
 
02:09:20.350 --> 02:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
I'm again like the other question I'm
 
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
sure it's readily
 
02:09:24.510 --> 02:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
accessible that
 
02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
answer additional questions I see
 
02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:29.549 align:start position:0%
answer additional questions I see
representative

02:09:29.549 --> 02:09:29.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:09:33.229 --> 02:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair and my
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
apologies if you don't know the answer
 
02:09:37.589 --> 02:09:37.599 align:start position:0%
to this question but as I'm reading
 
02:09:40.109 --> 02:09:40.119 align:start position:0%
current law there are a whole lot of
 
02:09:42.830 --> 02:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
other conditions that have to be met
 
02:09:46.950 --> 02:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
underneath what's out in your bill uh I
 
02:09:50.669 --> 02:09:50.679 align:start position:0%
am assuming that when OS put this bill
 
02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
into its draft form that they they
 
02:09:55.549 --> 02:09:55.559 align:start position:0%
assumed that those current conditions
 
02:09:58.069 --> 02:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
still have to be met I guess I just want
 
02:10:00.430 --> 02:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that I ask you that
 
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
question sure thank you for the question
 
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
and so there are in existing statute the
 
02:10:08.910 --> 02:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity the option to for
 
02:10:11.030 --> 02:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities to Grant a tax credit to
 
02:10:13.669 --> 02:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
Veterans is predicated on certain
 
02:10:14.750 --> 02:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
conditions I think that's what you're
 
02:10:17.270 --> 02:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
referring to and this measure before you
 
02:10:22.030 --> 02:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
is very short and uh the answer is uh
 
02:10:24.549 --> 02:10:24.559 align:start position:0%
my understanding when OS drafted this
 
02:10:26.790 --> 02:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
that they didn't see a need to restate
 
02:10:30.149 --> 02:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
all the different um conditions for the
 
02:10:32.109 --> 02:10:32.119 align:start position:0%
eligibility for the tax credit so that
 
02:10:36.990 --> 02:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:38.830 align:start position:0%
 
interpretation

02:10:38.830 --> 02:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
02:10:42.669 --> 02:10:42.679 align:start position:0%
okay representative ma majori thank you
 
02:10:44.790 --> 02:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair um I actually have two
 
02:10:46.430 --> 02:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
questions and I have one for you madam
 
02:10:48.069 --> 02:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
chair also but it's it's going to be the
 
02:10:49.830 --> 02:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
same one for the sponsor thank you so
 
02:10:52.669 --> 02:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
much for testifying have you contacted
 
02:10:55.350 --> 02:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
or were the the ass was the assessing
 
02:10:59.189 --> 02:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
Association contacted about this bill
 
02:11:00.990 --> 02:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
and are they here to testify that's my
 
02:11:02.709 --> 02:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you for your question
 
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
I did not uh contact that that or
 
02:11:07.790 --> 02:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
organization as to whether the
 
02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
researchers OSS may have I I do not know
 
02:11:13.229 --> 02:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
02:11:16.990 --> 02:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
you and M followup for you madam do we
 
02:11:19.549 --> 02:11:19.559 align:start position:0%
know if they're here because I I if
 
02:11:23.030 --> 02:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
they're did they send in a pin card
 
02:11:25.629 --> 02:11:25.639 align:start position:0%
the I do not have a pink card for them
 
02:11:28.109 --> 02:11:28.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:30.549 --> 02:11:30.559 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:40.149 --> 02:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
so based on the bill language if a
 
02:11:43.830 --> 02:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
municipality or actually a town were to
 
02:11:47.229 --> 02:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
adopt 100% of the property
 
02:11:51.870 --> 02:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
tax okay my question given that my
 
02:11:55.669 --> 02:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
question is why do you could you
 
02:12:00.830 --> 02:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
explain why you think or feel that this
 
02:12:03.790 --> 02:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
is needed in addition to the RSA that
 
02:12:06.910 --> 02:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
representative Colby cited which is um
 
02:12:12.589 --> 02:12:12.599 align:start position:0%
72 36a which already does provide 100%
 
02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
exemption for certain disabled veterans
 
02:12:21.470 --> 02:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
specifically those who qualify under the
 
02:12:26.990 --> 02:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
Sha or S homes why would we need this
 
02:12:29.910 --> 02:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
provision in addition to that thank you
 
02:12:32.430 --> 02:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
for the question Madam chair uh yes
 
02:12:35.910 --> 02:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
there does seem to be a redundancy in in
 
02:12:38.390 --> 02:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
this brief measure as compared to the
 
02:12:40.470 --> 02:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
one you just described and my
 
02:12:42.430 --> 02:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
understanding is that somehow there was
 
02:12:44.549 --> 02:12:44.559 align:start position:0%
a gap that was seen in certain
 
02:12:46.589 --> 02:12:46.599 align:start position:0%
circumstances that was not
 
02:12:50.149 --> 02:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
covered uh and as to whether that Gap uh
 
02:12:52.830 --> 02:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
really exists or is significant uh I'm
 
02:12:55.030 --> 02:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
sure someone following me may be able to
 
02:12:57.270 --> 02:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
speak to that or subsequently in the in
 
02:12:58.750 --> 02:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
all the time that the committee will
 
02:13:00.430 --> 02:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
have this this measure during the rest
 
02:13:04.109 --> 02:13:04.119 align:start position:0%
of the month before you execute uh I'm
 
02:13:06.830 --> 02:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
sure an easy answer can be uh attained
 
02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
but I my understanding is that there was
 
02:13:10.830 --> 02:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
some Gap under some some circumstances
 
02:13:14.229 --> 02:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
with existing code or or statute that
 
02:13:17.310 --> 02:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
this would uh uh make cover and make
 
02:13:18.750 --> 02:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
sure there were no
 
02:13:20.910 --> 02:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
gaps thank you and I have one final
 
02:13:23.149 --> 02:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
question question
 
02:13:26.069 --> 02:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
um the bill this is not the amended
 
02:13:29.189 --> 02:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
language but the the section of Statute
 
02:13:32.750 --> 02:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
refers to total disability is it true
 
02:13:35.589 --> 02:13:35.599 align:start position:0%
that um a veteran could be totally
 
02:13:38.149 --> 02:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
disabled but still
 
02:13:41.910 --> 02:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
work and and and perhaps for example
 
02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
maybe be the president of
 
02:13:47.950 --> 02:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
bae thank you for that question lots of
 
02:13:50.430 --> 02:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
great questions and that's another one
 
02:13:52.549 --> 02:13:52.559 align:start position:0%
um the honble Lyn blanken Beaker who
 
02:13:55.870 --> 02:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
some of you know uh uh former member of
 
02:13:59.790 --> 02:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
this body uh very uh well respected uh
 
02:14:02.189 --> 02:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
Navy captain in the reserves contacted
 
02:14:05.790 --> 02:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
me on Saturday with regard to this and
 
02:14:08.430 --> 02:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
uh to your point she specifically spoke
 
02:14:11.470 --> 02:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
to me about some of the confusion about
 
02:14:13.629 --> 02:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
what 100% disabled means totally
 
02:14:18.910 --> 02:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
disabled means um and there is that's a
 
02:14:21.870 --> 02:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
very potentially uh complicated and even
 
02:14:26.229 --> 02:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
an emotional question because there are
 
02:14:29.350 --> 02:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh Lynn The Honorable Lynn Blankenbaker
 
02:14:31.109 --> 02:14:31.119 align:start position:0%
pointed out to me that there are many
 
02:14:32.990 --> 02:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
veterans who are totally disabled have
 
02:14:36.669 --> 02:14:36.679 align:start position:0%
100% disability who can still work and
 
02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
so you all or many of you probably know
 
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
people who have percentage of disability
 
02:14:44.669 --> 02:14:44.679 align:start position:0%
maybe even or 100% disabled and you see
 
02:14:46.990 --> 02:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
them doing this doing that or working
 
02:14:50.709 --> 02:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
and so the question arises um why is
 
02:14:53.069 --> 02:14:53.079 align:start position:0%
somebody somebody who is ostensibly 100%
 
02:14:55.750 --> 02:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
disabled uh doing this activity or why
 
02:14:57.310 --> 02:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
are they working if they're 100%
 
02:15:00.189 --> 02:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
disabled and or in some cases seeking a
 
02:15:04.189 --> 02:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
tax credit and uh lind's point and I
 
02:15:07.109 --> 02:15:07.119 align:start position:0%
won't get into it here uh in detail
 
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
other than to say she's concerned that
 
02:15:12.229 --> 02:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
people understand that some veterans who
 
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh have PTSD related type disabilities
 
02:15:19.069 --> 02:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
or physical disabilities need and should
 
02:15:22.149 --> 02:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
work and even though they are 100%
 
02:15:24.990 --> 02:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
disabled uh medically for whatever
 
02:15:28.270 --> 02:15:28.280 align:start position:0%
combination of reasons um she thinks
 
02:15:31.350 --> 02:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
that it's very important that they do
 
02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
when when they can where they can uh be
 
02:15:38.830 --> 02:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
gainfully employed uh or doing something
 
02:15:41.589 --> 02:15:41.599 align:start position:0%
so if if that touches on your your
 
02:15:44.310 --> 02:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
question I know and I know you know uh I
 
02:15:47.069 --> 02:15:47.079 align:start position:0%
know your your husband is is uh has some
 
02:15:49.149 --> 02:15:49.159 align:start position:0%
wonderful marine marine military
 
02:15:54.189 --> 02:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
background so to your point uh it's a
 
02:15:56.629 --> 02:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
tricky question and and it it there
 
02:15:58.310 --> 02:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
needs to be some discussion
 
02:16:00.669 --> 02:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
understanding on what 100% total
 
02:16:02.350 --> 02:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
disability means and that it does not
 
02:16:04.270 --> 02:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
preclude and should not preclude working
 
02:16:06.990 --> 02:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
so somebody who's working may ask for
 
02:16:09.350 --> 02:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
this tax credit if it goes forward and
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
um people need to understand that you
 
02:16:14.229 --> 02:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
can work and still be
 
02:16:17.870 --> 02:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
disabled thank you any further
 
02:16:20.910 --> 02:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative Gilman thank
 
02:16:22.149 --> 02:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
02:16:24.589 --> 02:16:24.599 align:start position:0%
representative I think I want to follow
 
02:16:28.189 --> 02:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
up on the uh chairwoman's question about
 
02:16:31.830 --> 02:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
the two rsas which may or may not be in
 
02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:33.549 align:start position:0%
the two rsas which may or may not be in
Conflict

02:16:33.549 --> 02:16:33.559 align:start position:0%
Conflict
 
02:16:37.150 --> 02:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
um is this supposed to fill the whole
 
02:16:40.589 --> 02:16:40.599 align:start position:0%
where um RSA
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
7236 deals with the special home
 
02:16:47.509 --> 02:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
adaptations and this bill does not thank
 
02:16:49.349 --> 02:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
you for the question uh that goes right
 
02:16:52.070 --> 02:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
to representative sudor is he still here
 
02:16:55.190 --> 02:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh yes he is uh that goes right to his
 
02:16:58.070 --> 02:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
question and concern and uh he's here
 
02:17:00.270 --> 02:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
and I know he's going to speak to that
 
02:17:04.910 --> 02:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
um in in detail and yes I I this was
 
02:17:07.469 --> 02:17:07.479 align:start position:0%
initially a I was asked to try to move
 
02:17:09.629 --> 02:17:09.639 align:start position:0%
this to you so you could look at this
 
02:17:11.629 --> 02:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
tax credit option and as I mentioned
 
02:17:13.790 --> 02:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
before there was a perceived Gap that
 
02:17:16.110 --> 02:17:16.120 align:start position:0%

representative sudor because I know that
 
02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
that's the piece of it that he
 
02:17:24.629 --> 02:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
specifically wants to
 
02:17:27.870 --> 02:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
address that sounds perfect any other
 
02:17:30.389 --> 02:17:30.399 align:start position:0%

sudor so um you've asked to speak five
 
02:17:48.990 --> 02:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
minutes I would kindly ask that you try
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
to keep your remarks to three minutes or
 
02:17:53.190 --> 02:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
less if you have anything additional to
 
02:17:57.629 --> 02:17:57.639 align:start position:0%
to share we we're way over schedule um
 
02:17:59.669 --> 02:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
feel free to send that along to all the
 
02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
committee members via email thanks thank
 
02:18:03.230 --> 02:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thanks for giving me the
 
02:18:05.349 --> 02:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address this this is
 
02:18:07.309 --> 02:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
something I've kind of made a personal
 
02:18:09.750 --> 02:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
expertise in the last decade about
 
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
helping veterans out and understanding
 
02:18:13.110 --> 02:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
what the rules of law are and what
 
02:18:15.230 --> 02:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
benefits veterans truly have here
 
02:18:16.669 --> 02:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
there's nothing more disappointing than
 
02:18:19.230 --> 02:18:19.240 align:start position:0%
going to a shop seeing a fellow Marine
 
02:18:21.830 --> 02:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
that's lost his legs he's I got 30%
 
02:18:23.309 --> 02:18:23.319 align:start position:0%
disability because that's what the
 
02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
Marine Corps gave me he didn't even know
 
02:18:27.750 --> 02:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
he had to go to the ba true story right
 
02:18:29.910 --> 02:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire so I made it my
 
02:18:32.309 --> 02:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
goal to go over this to answer some of
 
02:18:34.549 --> 02:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
the questions that were asked earlier I
 
02:18:36.509 --> 02:18:36.519 align:start position:0%
am also selected for my town to town of
 
02:18:40.790 --> 02:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
Mason We address each request for VA
 
02:18:44.469 --> 02:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
exemption individually not as a blanket
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
because each case is different each
 
02:18:48.709 --> 02:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
individual is different uh so we can't
 
02:18:50.750 --> 02:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
just do a blanket we don't haven't figed
 
02:18:52.589 --> 02:18:52.599 align:start position:0%
figure out how we could just blanket it
 
02:18:55.950 --> 02:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
we do it individual person by
 
02:19:00.950 --> 02:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
request when it comes to RSA 7236 a the
 
02:19:03.790 --> 02:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
question was asked about
 
02:19:10.469 --> 02:19:10.479 align:start position:0%
the um s and sha well sah if I don't get
 
02:19:13.349 --> 02:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
them backwards is meant to help
 
02:19:16.070 --> 02:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
facilitate the building of a dwelling
 
02:19:19.270 --> 02:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
for those veteran who has special needs
 
02:19:22.349 --> 02:19:22.359 align:start position:0%
uh to live in the the other one is to do
 
02:19:25.389 --> 02:19:25.399 align:start position:0%
special adaption to that same dwelling
 
02:19:28.230 --> 02:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
or to a house they already own but what
 
02:19:31.990 --> 02:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
we miss is that at the Veterans Hospital
 
02:19:34.509 --> 02:19:34.519 align:start position:0%
right here in Manchester you can request
 
02:19:36.270 --> 02:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
an evaluation of your house due to
 
02:19:40.150 --> 02:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
orthop through the uh Prosthetics Clinic
 
02:19:41.750 --> 02:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
they will send a representative out to
 
02:19:44.549 --> 02:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
your house they will make changes
 
02:19:45.990 --> 02:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
whatever you need including building
 
02:19:49.550 --> 02:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
ramps making bathrooms kitchens designs
 
02:19:52.710 --> 02:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
anything you need exact like that and we
 
02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
can do it right here at the VA Hospital
 
02:19:55.830 --> 02:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of veterans don't realize they can
 
02:19:57.750 --> 02:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
do that after they make their evaluation
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
they'll send a contractor out and the
 
02:20:00.469 --> 02:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
contractor will make the changes to your
 
02:20:02.510 --> 02:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
house so I'm trying to bring that
 
02:20:06.150 --> 02:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
awareness so when we tie these to just s
 
02:20:06.160 --> 02:20:06.950 align:start position:0%
awareness so when we tie these to just s
or

02:20:06.950 --> 02:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:20:09.550 --> 02:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
sha we're not doing a service we're
 
02:20:12.270 --> 02:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
we're we're telling veterans you can't
 
02:20:13.870 --> 02:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
even apply for this unless you have
 
02:20:16.429 --> 02:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
these grants well that's not true
 
02:20:19.030 --> 02:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
because the VA does it exactly the same
 
02:20:21.510 --> 02:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
way and we need work on that language
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
that just because you own a house that's
 
02:20:28.349 --> 02:20:28.359 align:start position:0%
Ada equip uh Ada equipped and the VA
 
02:20:29.790 --> 02:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
comes out and make and makes the changes
 
02:20:31.429 --> 02:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
to your house exactly the same thing is
 
02:20:33.590 --> 02:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
going to happen in sah or
 
02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
Si you can't apply for this loan I don't
 
02:20:40.990 --> 02:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
think that was the spirit of 35 or 72
 
02:20:44.510 --> 02:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
36a now how we determine what a
 
02:20:46.950 --> 02:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
permanent disab dis disabled veteran is
 
02:20:48.950 --> 02:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
is very simple the VA determines it for
 
02:20:51.150 --> 02:20:51.160 align:start position:0%
us and we go off of their
 
02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations when they send out a
 
02:20:57.950 --> 02:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
letter of to about a veteran they talk
 
02:20:59.750 --> 02:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
about his disability service connection
 
02:21:01.230 --> 02:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
everything else about it what its
 
02:21:03.309 --> 02:21:03.319 align:start position:0%
percentage is it will say things like
 
02:21:06.590 --> 02:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
this service connected disability yes or
 
02:21:08.990 --> 02:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
no your combined service connected
 
02:21:12.469 --> 02:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
evaluation is whatever that percentage
 
02:21:15.349 --> 02:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
is it says your currently monthly award
 
02:21:17.750 --> 02:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
whatever that award is that's your VA
 
02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
pay are you entitled to H uh hire level
 
02:21:22.750 --> 02:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
of disability to be
 
02:21:25.429 --> 02:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
unemployable it's either yes or
 
02:21:27.950 --> 02:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
no that right there tells you that the
 
02:21:29.830 --> 02:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
veteran is unemployable due to their
 
02:21:32.830 --> 02:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
injuries is a yes or no answer are you
 
02:21:33.870 --> 02:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
considered totally imp permanately
 
02:21:36.590 --> 02:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
disabled due to your service connected
 
02:21:40.389 --> 02:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
disabilities again yes or no so all this
 
02:21:42.309 --> 02:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
is information that the veteran can
 
02:21:45.950 --> 02:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
bring with them when they apply to their
 
02:21:47.110 --> 02:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
local government to their local
 
02:21:48.990 --> 02:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
Selectmen and it answers all the
 
02:21:53.389 --> 02:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the 25 uh or 7236
 
02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
a I submitted uh a paper in on it that
 
02:22:04.309 --> 02:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
says it talks
 
02:22:06.750 --> 02:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
about special adapted housing that they
 
02:22:08.670 --> 02:22:08.680 align:start position:0%
must have these
 
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
grants well I submitted that after you
 
02:22:15.270 --> 02:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
say that we should say or owns a house
 
02:22:17.110 --> 02:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
that is ADA Compliant and meets the
 
02:22:18.670 --> 02:22:18.680 align:start position:0%
needs for their disabilities or is
 
02:22:21.950 --> 02:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
modified through the VA syst system the
 
02:22:26.030 --> 02:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
the witness suspend we we need to we
 
02:22:30.030 --> 02:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
need you to um restrict your comments to
 
02:22:32.070 --> 02:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
the section of Statute that's in the
 
02:22:34.790 --> 02:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
Bill yes ma'am Ma and not to speak to
 
02:22:37.150 --> 02:22:37.160 align:start position:0%
another section of Statute that's not in
 
02:22:39.230 --> 02:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
front of us and also you're at four
 
02:22:41.469 --> 02:22:41.479 align:start position:0%
minutes so if you could um okay wrap it
 
02:22:42.710 --> 02:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
up that would be great I'm kind of
 
02:22:43.910 --> 02:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
passionate about this because I've
 
02:22:45.830 --> 02:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
talked like I said with the director
 
02:22:48.270 --> 02:22:48.280 align:start position:0%
William uh I'm going to murder his name
 
02:22:50.590 --> 02:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
cadro he is the director of New
 
02:22:53.070 --> 02:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Veterans Affairs
 
02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
and he's under impression and has
 
02:22:59.710 --> 02:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
U of this is if a veteran doesn't have
 
02:23:02.469 --> 02:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
either one of those grants they are not
 
02:23:03.750 --> 02:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to even
 
02:23:07.910 --> 02:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
apply they can have no legs no arms no
 
02:23:09.950 --> 02:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
sight they can't apply because they
 
02:23:11.550 --> 02:23:11.560 align:start position:0%
don't have those
 
02:23:13.830 --> 02:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
grants and I don't think that was the
 
02:23:17.950 --> 02:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
intent at all so I support this 100% of
 
02:23:20.230 --> 02:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
making it a clear and kind of un muddy
 
02:23:23.469 --> 02:23:23.479 align:start position:0%
to waters for the veterans and I hope I
 
02:23:26.150 --> 02:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
get all your support on that I really do
 
02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:28.110 align:start position:0%
get all your support on that I really do

being an advocate for veterans in our
 
02:24:16.910 --> 02:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
state when we were having our debates
 
02:24:18.630 --> 02:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
before our elections a common theme that
 
02:24:20.150 --> 02:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
came up was that veterans were not able
 
02:24:22.950 --> 02:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
to get sufficient support for tax
 
02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:24.750 align:start position:0%
to get sufficient support for tax

02:24:24.750 --> 02:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
credits
 
02:24:28.550 --> 02:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
um the cost of the VA compensation of
 
02:24:30.469 --> 02:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
pension has been rising but at a very
 
02:24:32.590 --> 02:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
low rate and not in accordance with the
 
02:24:33.990 --> 02:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
keeping of
 
02:24:36.030 --> 02:24:36.040 align:start position:0%
inflation which has been tough for many
 
02:24:37.550 --> 02:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
veterans because many of them have said
 
02:24:38.910 --> 02:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
that they won't be able to stay in their
 
02:24:41.830 --> 02:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
houses even though they are 100%
 
02:24:44.150 --> 02:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
disabled um passions of this bill would
 
02:24:47.790 --> 02:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
allow towns to allow 100% disabled
 
02:24:49.950 --> 02:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
veterans have 100% ta property tax
 
02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:51.190 align:start position:0%
veterans have 100% ta property tax
exemption

02:24:51.190 --> 02:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
02:24:53.070 --> 02:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
there was similar language passed by
 
02:24:55.469 --> 02:24:55.479 align:start position:0%
both the house and the uh the Senate of
 
02:24:58.429 --> 02:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
this body that had an administrative
 
02:25:00.710 --> 02:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
Chevron rule put on it which essentially
 
02:25:02.349 --> 02:25:02.359 align:start position:0%
said that if you didn't have an sah
 
02:25:05.590 --> 02:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
grant that you could not have that even
 
02:25:06.950 --> 02:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
though the the Department of Veterans
 
02:25:08.990 --> 02:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
Affairs actually sent out paperwork
 
02:25:10.870 --> 02:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
saying if you are 100% disabled veteran
 
02:25:12.349 --> 02:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
report to your tax office and turn over
 
02:25:14.790 --> 02:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
your paperwork so as we know from the
 
02:25:17.150 --> 02:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court these administrative rules
 
02:25:19.349 --> 02:25:19.359 align:start position:0%
are not supposed to be as restrictive or
 
02:25:22.469 --> 02:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
as over overwhelming as they have become
 
02:25:25.349 --> 02:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
however um I think this language is
 
02:25:27.910 --> 02:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate because there are people who
 
02:25:30.389 --> 02:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
cannot guess get sah grants because
 
02:25:32.429 --> 02:25:32.439 align:start position:0%
there's a limit on the amount of money
 
02:25:34.309 --> 02:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
so there may only be one available for
 
02:25:36.030 --> 02:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire in any given
 
02:25:38.190 --> 02:25:38.200 align:start position:0%
year and there are many people veterans
 
02:25:39.870 --> 02:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
who go through other organizations like
 
02:25:41.710 --> 02:25:41.720 align:start position:0%
homes for their troops to get their
 
02:25:44.990 --> 02:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
houses modified so I absolutely 100%
 
02:25:46.670 --> 02:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
support this bill I know this bill came
 
02:25:49.030 --> 02:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
forward in another form in the past at
 
02:25:51.030 --> 02:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
which point representative miss Shay had
 
02:25:52.910 --> 02:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
said that some towns haven't increased
 
02:25:54.510 --> 02:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
their veterans tax credit since the
 
02:25:57.469 --> 02:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
Civil War which is not appropriate we
 
02:25:59.750 --> 02:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
need to support our veterans and as for
 
02:26:01.950 --> 02:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
the difference of 100% disabled veterans
 
02:26:03.710 --> 02:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
there's scheduler veterans and there's
 
02:26:06.870 --> 02:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
tdiu veterans tdiu veterans are 100%
 
02:26:08.670 --> 02:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
disabled and are unable to work which
 
02:26:10.389 --> 02:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
means they cannot be gainfully employed
 
02:26:12.750 --> 02:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
in any way scheduled veterans have had
 
02:26:17.510 --> 02:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
injuries so severe that they um they
 
02:26:20.750 --> 02:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
basically overrun the VA math system
 
02:26:22.389 --> 02:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
and they're going to be 100% but the
 
02:26:25.150 --> 02:26:25.160 align:start position:0%
100% rating is not guaranteed forever
 
02:26:27.190 --> 02:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
you only have it and the VA re-evaluates
 
02:26:29.070 --> 02:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
you periodically and you can lose that
 
02:26:31.630 --> 02:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
rating so this is not necessarily a
 
02:26:34.030 --> 02:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
permanent component and I'd ask you to
 
02:26:35.630 --> 02:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
bear that in mind because many people
 
02:26:37.110 --> 02:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
for example if a veteran has
 
02:26:39.309 --> 02:26:39.319 align:start position:0%
debilitating cancer and cannot work they
 
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
could be 100% rated but that may only be
 
02:26:45.309 --> 02:26:45.319 align:start position:0%
during their treatment and at that point
 
02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
it may terminate and they may go to
 
02:26:48.950 --> 02:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
another level so I'd like you to
 
02:26:50.870 --> 02:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
consider that as well because this 100%
 
02:26:53.550 --> 02:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
rating is never permanent it's always up
 
02:26:57.630 --> 02:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
subject to review so um I'm available
 
02:27:00.429 --> 02:27:00.439 align:start position:0%
for any questions I do support this 100%
 
02:27:02.070 --> 02:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
I do believe it is necessary I do
 
02:27:03.429 --> 02:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
believe there are many veterans who are
 
02:27:05.469 --> 02:27:05.479 align:start position:0%
struggling they have made their voices
 
02:27:09.150 --> 02:27:09.160 align:start position:0%
clear during the election when they came
 
02:27:10.870 --> 02:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
and expressed their
 
02:27:12.790 --> 02:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
interests so I would ask for your
 
02:27:15.389 --> 02:27:15.399 align:start position:0%
support for that thank you Miss Ryan and
 
02:27:17.790 --> 02:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your
 
02:27:20.750 --> 02:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
support or I meant what I meant you
 
02:27:22.429 --> 02:27:22.439 align:start position:0%
support the bill and I appreciate your
 
02:27:24.630 --> 02:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
service that's what I meant I understand
 
02:27:27.349 --> 02:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
okay questions
 
02:27:29.590 --> 02:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
02:27:33.389 --> 02:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
frock thank you madam chair
 
02:27:37.590 --> 02:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
um I am at this point very
 
02:27:41.349 --> 02:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
confused the amendment to the bill talks
 
02:27:41.359 --> 02:27:42.910 align:start position:0%
confused the amendment to the bill talks
about

02:27:42.910 --> 02:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:27:46.670 --> 02:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
100% reduction or exemption of the
 
02:27:49.870 --> 02:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
veterans property tax and I've heard a
 
02:27:53.230 --> 02:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
lot of testimony from you and others
 
02:27:56.750 --> 02:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
about 100% disability and what
 
02:27:59.990 --> 02:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
percentage of disability can you
 
02:28:02.429 --> 02:28:02.439 align:start position:0%
straighten me out on this please so
 
02:28:03.950 --> 02:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
could you clarify your question for me
 
02:28:05.790 --> 02:28:05.800 align:start position:0%
do you want to know what 100% disability
 
02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
entails no I am ask I what I am asking
 
02:28:13.990 --> 02:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
is what is the relationship between the
 
02:28:17.349 --> 02:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
veteran disability and the amendment to
 
02:28:19.110 --> 02:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
this bill which is
 
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
for a percentage of the property tax
 
02:28:23.520 --> 02:28:29.110 align:start position:0%
for a percentage of the property tax
okay

02:28:29.110 --> 02:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:31.750 --> 02:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
um basically from my perspective this
 
02:28:35.230 --> 02:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
gives a a municipality or a town the
 
02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:36.750 align:start position:0%
gives a a municipality or a town the
ability

02:28:36.750 --> 02:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
ability
 
02:28:40.429 --> 02:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
to change or increase the veterans tax
 
02:28:43.190 --> 02:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
credit if they vote to do
 
02:28:46.590 --> 02:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
so based off criteria that they see fit
 
02:28:48.510 --> 02:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
I mean there are many people
 
02:28:52.550 --> 02:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
who essentially went to the VA to try
 
02:28:55.150 --> 02:28:55.160 align:start position:0%
and get additional tax credit because
 
02:28:56.710 --> 02:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
the VA put out a directive saying that
 
02:28:59.110 --> 02:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
you could and then found out that no
 
02:29:00.670 --> 02:29:00.680 align:start position:0%
there were these administrative rules
 
02:29:02.389 --> 02:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
that were restricting it and I think
 
02:29:03.950 --> 02:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
that we don't need to have
 
02:29:06.670 --> 02:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
administrative rules to restrict
 
02:29:08.750 --> 02:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
it I'm not sure I'm answering your
 
02:29:12.110 --> 02:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:16.590 --> 02:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
sure um that make it so I'm
 
02:29:18.990 --> 02:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
just yes you can have a you can have a
 
02:29:23.030 --> 02:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
followup but we need to remember that we
 
02:29:26.269 --> 02:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
we need to speak to and I think that
 
02:29:28.389 --> 02:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
that that's what you're getting at the
 
02:29:30.510 --> 02:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
amended language in the bill and and
 
02:29:33.030 --> 02:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
nothing else because what is before us
 
02:29:36.190 --> 02:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
the change has to do with the upper
 
02:29:40.750 --> 02:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
bound of this property um tax credit not
 
02:29:46.590 --> 02:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
any other um criteria so chair no thank
 
02:29:48.830 --> 02:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
you for clarifying that uh that was
 
02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
going to be the essence of my question I
 
02:29:53.670 --> 02:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate that further
 
02:29:56.070 --> 02:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank thank you
 
02:29:58.309 --> 02:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
for coming here today we appreciate it
 
02:29:59.830 --> 02:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
um I apologize I didn't mean to say
 
02:30:01.429 --> 02:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
something else which was just that there
 
02:30:03.990 --> 02:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
are only 71 households eligible for this
 
02:30:07.309 --> 02:30:07.319 align:start position:0%
tax credit in my town and the um
 
02:30:08.670 --> 02:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
somebody had asked about the assessors
 
02:30:10.510 --> 02:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
Association but it's
 
02:30:13.030 --> 02:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
0.004% of the
 
02:30:15.910 --> 02:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
budget thank
 
02:30:18.510 --> 02:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
you the last pink card that I have
 
02:30:27.030 --> 02:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:30.190 --> 02:30:30.200 align:start position:0%
cor three minutes or less if possible
 
02:30:33.150 --> 02:30:33.160 align:start position:0%
for for your U my name is Adam denor I'm
 
02:30:34.230 --> 02:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
here representing the Department of
 
02:30:36.590 --> 02:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration uh the department
 
02:30:38.670 --> 02:30:38.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a policy or a position on
 
02:30:40.670 --> 02:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
this particular piece of policy although
 
02:30:43.309 --> 02:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
there is one technical issue a
 
02:30:46.510 --> 02:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
percentage credit of any kind between
 
02:30:48.950 --> 02:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
one and 100 is not actually workable in
 
02:30:50.910 --> 02:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
the tax rate calculation
 
02:30:52.870 --> 02:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
we need to know when we go to set a tax
 
02:30:54.910 --> 02:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
rate the amount of the credit at the
 
02:30:57.389 --> 02:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
time that we calculate it um so
 
02:30:59.150 --> 02:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
basically the the tax rate calculation
 
02:31:02.070 --> 02:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
can be distilled down to a numerator
 
02:31:03.670 --> 02:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
which is your tax levy your
 
02:31:05.790 --> 02:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
Appropriations less revenues and a
 
02:31:08.590 --> 02:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
denominator which is your tax base uh
 
02:31:10.429 --> 02:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
the uh credit works as an additional
 
02:31:11.790 --> 02:31:11.800 align:start position:0%
amount of appropriation it's an amount
 
02:31:12.990 --> 02:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
of money that the town's going to have
 
02:31:14.950 --> 02:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
to raise in excess of what they would
 
02:31:16.429 --> 02:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
normally need to raise in order to cover
 
02:31:19.150 --> 02:31:19.160 align:start position:0%
for the folks that will not be paying it
 
02:31:21.030 --> 02:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
if we don't know know that appropriation
 
02:31:22.750 --> 02:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
amount at the time that we calculate the
 
02:31:26.269 --> 02:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
rate uh we can't calculate a rate
 
02:31:28.670 --> 02:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
additionally since that credit amount is
 
02:31:30.190 --> 02:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
dependent on the rate that's then
 
02:31:33.269 --> 02:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
calculated it creates a circular
 
02:31:36.070 --> 02:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
calculation that will constantly regress
 
02:31:40.950 --> 02:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
um forever so the way to accomplish a um
 
02:31:42.550 --> 02:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
removing the tax bill for a property is
 
02:31:44.429 --> 02:31:44.439 align:start position:0%
through an exemption not through a
 
02:31:46.590 --> 02:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
credit so this bill will at least need
 
02:31:48.190 --> 02:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
some amendment to reference the
 
02:31:49.510 --> 02:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
possibility that municipality could
 
02:31:52.469 --> 02:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
adopt a full property tax exemption
 
02:31:54.630 --> 02:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
rather than a 100%
 
02:31:57.349 --> 02:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
credit and and I there I just want to
 
02:31:59.389 --> 02:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
make one other point there's been I
 
02:32:02.349 --> 02:32:02.359 align:start position:0%
think some cross-pollination here with
 
02:32:07.510 --> 02:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
72 36a and 7235 7235 the the key part of
 
02:32:10.190 --> 02:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
it is that total and permanent service
 
02:32:12.269 --> 02:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
connected disability when a when a
 
02:32:13.870 --> 02:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
municipality receives an application
 
02:32:15.630 --> 02:32:15.640 align:start position:0%
they are looking for that specific
 
02:32:19.670 --> 02:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
designation on this measure so the one
 
02:32:23.389 --> 02:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
the the you know 100 or 50% disability
 
02:32:26.030 --> 02:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
is on a separate statute this one in
 
02:32:28.830 --> 02:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
particular 7235 is specifically about um
 
02:32:32.150 --> 02:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
total and permanent service connected
 
02:32:35.670 --> 02:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
disability thank you questions for Mr
 
02:32:35.680 --> 02:32:37.670 align:start position:0%
disability thank you questions for Mr

02:32:44.429 --> 02:32:44.439 align:start position:0%
have numbers for
 
02:32:46.590 --> 02:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
20124 uh but in
 
02:32:49.990 --> 02:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
2023 do you recall the total number uh
 
02:32:53.590 --> 02:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
of um exemptions or credits that were
 
02:32:57.349 --> 02:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
awarded under 7235 yes I I don't
 
02:32:58.990 --> 02:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
although I could email the committee I
 
02:33:00.309 --> 02:33:00.319 align:start position:0%
could find that rather quickly and email
 
02:33:03.870 --> 02:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
it over okay thank you thank you that
 
02:33:05.150 --> 02:33:05.160 align:start position:0%

03:08:12.510 --> 03:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh firstly let
 
03:08:15.590 --> 03:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
me say ahead of time if my phone were to
 
03:08:17.469 --> 03:08:17.479 align:start position:0%
go off I sincerely apologize nor
 
03:08:18.990 --> 03:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
normally I would never keep it on but I
 
03:08:20.710 --> 03:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
am expecting my wife to go into labor
 
03:08:26.349 --> 03:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:30.349 --> 03:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
you fair so we'll get through this
 
03:08:33.750 --> 03:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
fairly quickly I think uh the record
 
03:08:35.630 --> 03:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
representative beler Carol County
 
03:08:37.070 --> 03:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
District 4
 
03:08:39.190 --> 03:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
Wakefield uh this bill is designed to
 
03:08:41.670 --> 03:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
create a light at the end of the tunnel
 
03:08:43.269 --> 03:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
it is an effort to create a set of
 
03:08:46.389 --> 03:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
circumstances tied to Advanced age under
 
03:08:49.030 --> 03:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
which you would no longer have to pay a
 
03:08:51.269 --> 03:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
yearly rent check to the government just
 
03:08:53.429 --> 03:08:53.439 align:start position:0%
to keep the home that you probably
 
03:08:55.830 --> 03:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
already own
 
03:08:58.429 --> 03:08:58.439 align:start position:0%
outright I have serious concerns about
 
03:09:00.510 --> 03:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
the Financial Health of many seniors in
 
03:09:01.830 --> 03:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
our current
 
03:09:05.150 --> 03:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
Society let me just say it plainly the
 
03:09:08.389 --> 03:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
official inflation numbers are a
 
03:09:11.110 --> 03:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
carefully curated
 
03:09:14.030 --> 03:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
fiction everyone who experiences a
 
03:09:17.710 --> 03:09:17.720 align:start position:0%
grocery bill understands this
 
03:09:20.870 --> 03:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
real inflation which is likely closer
 
03:09:24.469 --> 03:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
than to 20% than the advertised
 
03:09:26.990 --> 03:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
5% significantly
 
03:09:30.429 --> 03:09:30.439 align:start position:0%
outpaces the retirement income of very
 
03:09:33.349 --> 03:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
many seniors who in many cases income is
 
03:09:36.550 --> 03:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
based on official inflation
 
03:09:38.910 --> 03:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
statistics likewise the value of their
 
03:09:42.030 --> 03:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
properties in recent years has soared
 
03:09:44.510 --> 03:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
which in many cases has been coupled
 
03:09:46.790 --> 03:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
with increases in government spending
 
03:09:49.910 --> 03:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
which causes taxes to
 
03:09:53.590 --> 03:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
soar I do not want to see our seniors
 
03:09:56.150 --> 03:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
being evicted from the modest homes they
 
03:09:58.630 --> 03:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
already own because they can't afford
 
03:10:01.429 --> 03:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
outrageous taxes being levied on
 
03:10:06.389 --> 03:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
them however I also recognize that rapid
 
03:10:09.710 --> 03:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
and sharp uh decreases in local revenues
 
03:10:12.590 --> 03:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
could be a problem which is why there's
 
03:10:15.190 --> 03:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
many specifics in this bill designed to
 
03:10:18.150 --> 03:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
limit the initial impact on towns and of
 
03:10:21.910 --> 03:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:26.309 --> 03:10:26.319 align:start position:0%
legislation this bill would
 
03:10:29.309 --> 03:10:29.319 align:start position:0%
exempt up to
 
03:10:31.710 --> 03:10:31.720 align:start position:0%
$530,000 which is the at least at the
 
03:10:33.710 --> 03:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
time of putting this bill in the current
 
03:10:37.590 --> 03:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
median home price in the state from
 
03:10:42.950 --> 03:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
valuation for those seniors age 72 plus
 
03:10:45.469 --> 03:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
who have been a persistent New Hampshire
 
03:10:47.870 --> 03:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
resident for 10 or more years
 
03:10:50.070 --> 03:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
and who have been a owner or co-owner of
 
03:10:52.269 --> 03:10:52.279 align:start position:0%
the property they seek the exemption on
 
03:10:55.030 --> 03:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
for two or more years now I think those
 
03:10:56.710 --> 03:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
caveats were important to put in they
 
03:10:58.590 --> 03:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
were the result of speaking with a
 
03:11:00.110 --> 03:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
number of other reps and addressing
 
03:11:03.349 --> 03:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
certain concerns certainly I don't want
 
03:11:06.269 --> 03:11:06.279 align:start position:0%
to encourage those from our neighboring
 
03:11:07.870 --> 03:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
states who have spent most of their
 
03:11:12.110 --> 03:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
lives in high tax High government
 
03:11:15.070 --> 03:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
service areas to Simply jump over the
 
03:11:17.630 --> 03:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
Border buy a home live taxfree while
 
03:11:19.229 --> 03:11:19.239 align:start position:0%
encouraging higher taxes on everyone
 
03:11:21.150 --> 03:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
else that's not the point of this the
 
03:11:24.510 --> 03:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
point is to affect those long-term New
 
03:11:26.190 --> 03:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents who have lived here
 
03:11:28.389 --> 03:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
worked here raised families here who are
 
03:11:32.590 --> 03:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
rooted here to give them an end point
 
03:11:38.750 --> 03:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:41.630 --> 03:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
circumstances towns won't be taking huge
 
03:11:44.309 --> 03:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
hits by seeing that $10 million
 
03:11:47.429 --> 03:11:47.439 align:start position:0%
lakefront property Exempted from for the
 
03:11:49.389 --> 03:11:49.399 align:start position:0%
full amount of the property either it's
 
03:11:51.110 --> 03:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
only up to that
 
03:11:53.710 --> 03:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
$530,000 that would be Exempted and only
 
03:11:54.990 --> 03:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
that portion of any property that is
 
03:12:00.590 --> 03:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:03.710 --> 03:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
basis finally I know that the concern
 
03:12:05.150 --> 03:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
has been brought to me that this would
 
03:12:09.870 --> 03:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
simply shift the tax burden from elderly
 
03:12:12.030 --> 03:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
persons to younger families which have a
 
03:12:14.750 --> 03:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
which might have a detrimental impact I
 
03:12:17.030 --> 03:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
don't entirely disagree except it kind
 
03:12:19.389 --> 03:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
of misses the fundamental point that
 
03:12:22.229 --> 03:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with a problem of excess
 
03:12:25.550 --> 03:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
spending excess
 
03:12:27.469 --> 03:12:27.479 align:start position:0%
Taxation and we really ought to be
 
03:12:30.550 --> 03:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
looking first to cut spending rather
 
03:12:32.229 --> 03:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
than simply shift it off to somebody
 
03:12:35.710 --> 03:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
else of course that would all be at the
 
03:12:40.309 --> 03:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:40.319 --> 03:12:41.910 align:start position:0%
 
making

03:12:41.910 --> 03:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
making
 
03:12:45.550 --> 03:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
lastly while this would have a revenue
 
03:12:49.429 --> 03:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
negative impact in the obvious sense if
 
03:12:51.910 --> 03:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
adopted it would have a revenue positive
 
03:12:55.590 --> 03:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
impact in some less obvious sense namely
 
03:12:56.830 --> 03:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
this would
 
03:13:00.550 --> 03:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
incentivize families keeping older
 
03:13:03.670 --> 03:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
parents in the home to properly care for
 
03:13:05.269 --> 03:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
them in a loving environment where they
 
03:13:07.469 --> 03:13:07.479 align:start position:0%
really probably would rather be than
 
03:13:10.750 --> 03:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
someplace like a County nursing
 
03:13:13.510 --> 03:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
home so with that I will end and I will
 
03:13:15.510 --> 03:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions thank
 
03:13:17.510 --> 03:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you repres representative
 
03:13:20.150 --> 03:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
Belcher questions for the prime sponsor
 
03:13:22.190 --> 03:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
I see representative
 
03:13:24.309 --> 03:13:24.319 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:13:26.429 --> 03:13:26.439 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
03:13:26.439 --> 03:13:28.070 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
question

03:13:28.070 --> 03:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:13:31.830 --> 03:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
um what about a 72 year-old person or
 
03:13:35.830 --> 03:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
above who is a still working still
 
03:13:39.389 --> 03:13:39.399 align:start position:0%
working at a very highly paid job and
 
03:13:43.190 --> 03:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:45.429 --> 03:13:45.439 align:start position:0%
worth uh thank you for the question
 
03:13:47.710 --> 03:13:47.720 align:start position:0%
there is no such test
 
03:13:49.229 --> 03:13:49.239 align:start position:0%
in this bill as such it doesn't
 
03:13:50.750 --> 03:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
discriminate against somebody who is
 
03:13:53.309 --> 03:13:53.319 align:start position:0%
working versus not working it simply
 
03:13:56.389 --> 03:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
says at this Advanced age you've been
 
03:13:58.070 --> 03:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
here you've met the qualifications of
 
03:13:59.910 --> 03:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
living here 10 years of living in this
 
03:14:01.990 --> 03:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
home of being listed as a property owner
 
03:14:04.630 --> 03:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
on the property for two plus years those
 
03:14:12.630 --> 03:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:15.030 --> 03:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
you um the chair recognizes
 
03:14:21.349 --> 03:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:24.790 --> 03:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
I hope you're laughing with
 
03:14:28.190 --> 03:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
me thank you madam chairman um do you
 
03:14:32.070 --> 03:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
happen to know the average
 
03:14:36.229 --> 03:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:38.389 --> 03:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
Americans thank you for the question I
 
03:14:39.510 --> 03:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
don't off thought I Hadad know the
 
03:14:41.309 --> 03:14:41.319 align:start position:0%
average lifespan of Americans I did in
 
03:14:42.750 --> 03:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
part of drafting this bill look of the
 
03:14:44.510 --> 03:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
average lifespan for New Hampshire
 
03:14:46.710 --> 03:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
residents it varies by male and female
 
03:14:47.830 --> 03:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
but if I'm I'm not mistaken it was
 
03:14:53.349 --> 03:14:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:57.710 --> 03:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
 
03:14:59.950 --> 03:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
frock thank you madam
 
03:14:59.960 --> 03:15:01.590 align:start position:0%
frock thank you madam
chair

03:15:01.590 --> 03:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:15:04.429 --> 03:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
um this tax
 
03:15:08.550 --> 03:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
exemption applies to
 
03:15:08.560 --> 03:15:10.750 align:start position:0%
exemption applies to
homeowners

03:15:10.750 --> 03:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
homeowners
 
03:15:13.790 --> 03:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
now if I was a
 
03:15:17.030 --> 03:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
renter I would be paying my I would be
 
03:15:20.349 --> 03:15:20.359 align:start position:0%
paying property taxes through the
 
03:15:23.870 --> 03:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
rent and this does not
 
03:15:27.910 --> 03:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
address uh that portion of my rent that
 
03:15:31.590 --> 03:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
goes to property tax could you tell me
 
03:15:33.030 --> 03:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
why that is
 
03:15:36.150 --> 03:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
fair thank you for the question first um
 
03:15:38.630 --> 03:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
not exactly correct because uh renters
 
03:15:40.750 --> 03:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
are not directly paying property tax if
 
03:15:42.590 --> 03:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
you mean that it's a pass through from
 
03:15:45.269 --> 03:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
the rent presumably yes they would be
 
03:15:47.510 --> 03:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
paying for the owner's proper prop tax
 
03:15:49.950 --> 03:15:49.960 align:start position:0%
as as a part of renting this does not
 
03:15:53.590 --> 03:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
address um renters this addresses
 
03:15:56.910 --> 03:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
property owners only and I don't see any
 
03:16:00.790 --> 03:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
reasonably um simple way that you could
 
03:16:03.309 --> 03:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
address a renter in a in a position like
 
03:16:05.150 --> 03:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
03:16:07.469 --> 03:16:07.479 align:start position:0%
you further questions I see
 
03:16:07.479 --> 03:16:08.790 align:start position:0%
you further questions I see

03:16:10.710 --> 03:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
majori thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:16:13.229 --> 03:16:13.239 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um you create
 
03:16:17.429 --> 03:16:17.439 align:start position:0%
in this bill a definition for residents
 
03:16:21.309 --> 03:16:21.319 align:start position:0%
um there are existing in current law in
 
03:16:23.510 --> 03:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
RSA 216 and
 
03:16:26.590 --> 03:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
654 definitions for residents I'm
 
03:16:30.990 --> 03:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
curious if there was consideration of of
 
03:16:33.910 --> 03:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
those definitions or if this definition
 
03:16:36.349 --> 03:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
was specific for any reason I'm curious
 
03:16:39.189 --> 03:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
why the why another new definition thank
 
03:16:40.469 --> 03:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
you that that's a that is a good
 
03:16:42.670 --> 03:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
question uh so first of all the
 
03:16:45.429 --> 03:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
definition of um residence in this bill
 
03:16:47.150 --> 03:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
would only apply in this bill it
 
03:16:48.910 --> 03:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a broader than that set of
 
03:16:50.870 --> 03:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances and it was specifically
 
03:16:52.630 --> 03:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
because there was some confusion in the
 
03:16:55.349 --> 03:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
lawyerly language in trying to address
 
03:16:57.590 --> 03:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
the specific set of circumstances I was
 
03:17:00.630 --> 03:17:00.640 align:start position:0%
looking to exempt namely that it would
 
03:17:03.150 --> 03:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
not include any commercial or
 
03:17:05.670 --> 03:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
non-residential portion of any property
 
03:17:08.670 --> 03:17:08.680 align:start position:0%
the valuation on that um it would only
 
03:17:10.910 --> 03:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
be applicable to the residential portion
 
03:17:12.429 --> 03:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
of any property so that's the reason
 
03:17:15.269 --> 03:17:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:17.870 --> 03:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
there further question questions
 
03:17:17.880 --> 03:17:19.150 align:start position:0%
there further question questions
representative

03:17:19.150 --> 03:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:17:21.229 --> 03:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you madam chairman thank
 
03:17:22.590 --> 03:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
03:17:26.150 --> 03:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
question excuse me I I want to follow up
 
03:17:29.070 --> 03:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
on representative Major's uh question in
 
03:17:31.510 --> 03:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
that residents shall exclude attached
 
03:17:35.550 --> 03:17:35.560 align:start position:0%
dwelling units if we're trying to keep
 
03:17:41.110 --> 03:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:43.110 --> 03:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
families is
 
03:17:45.110 --> 03:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
there do don't you think there's a
 
03:17:47.510 --> 03:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
scenario where that elderly folk might
 
03:17:50.070 --> 03:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
want to live separately from their
 
03:17:52.349 --> 03:17:52.359 align:start position:0%
younger family members so a dwelling
 
03:17:54.510 --> 03:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
unit accessory dwelling unit would be
 
03:17:57.269 --> 03:17:57.279 align:start position:0%
the solution for them yes and thank you
 
03:18:00.030 --> 03:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
for the question um if if you look at
 
03:18:01.510 --> 03:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
the structure of the sentence in which
 
03:18:04.070 --> 03:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
we're looking at right now which is page
 
03:18:08.030 --> 03:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
one uh 14 line 14
 
03:18:13.349 --> 03:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
on it's not seeking to um exempt all
 
03:18:14.910 --> 03:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units it's only
 
03:18:17.150 --> 03:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
looking to to exempt those dwelling
 
03:18:19.950 --> 03:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
units that are commercial or otherwise
 
03:18:22.990 --> 03:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:23.000 --> 03:18:24.670 align:start position:0%
 
property

03:18:24.670 --> 03:18:24.680 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:18:26.630 --> 03:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
03:18:30.429 --> 03:18:30.439 align:start position:0%
you the chair recognizes representative
 
03:18:32.910 --> 03:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
Dolan thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:18:35.070 --> 03:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question as
 
03:18:38.189 --> 03:18:38.199 align:start position:0%
I as I read the the
 
03:18:42.150 --> 03:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh law as as you brought it Forward uh
 
03:18:45.630 --> 03:18:45.640 align:start position:0%
is I'm concerned about so-called gaming
 
03:18:47.269 --> 03:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
the system
 
03:18:52.269 --> 03:18:52.279 align:start position:0%
and uh what I'm talking about is you
 
03:18:53.990 --> 03:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
know how do
 
03:18:54.000 --> 03:18:56.550 align:start position:0%
know how do
we

03:18:56.550 --> 03:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:18:59.349 --> 03:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
prevent uh go getting Grandma and having
 
03:19:03.070 --> 03:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
her move in with you so that you can now
 
03:19:07.309 --> 03:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
exploit the the uh the exemption if
 
03:19:09.429 --> 03:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
she's been living in the state for over
 
03:19:12.070 --> 03:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
10 years have you have you given any
 
03:19:12.080 --> 03:19:13.550 align:start position:0%
10 years have you have you given any
thought

03:19:13.550 --> 03:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
thought
 
03:19:17.189 --> 03:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
to um instead of living in the the
 
03:19:19.110 --> 03:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
residents being living in the state for
 
03:19:22.189 --> 03:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
10 years how about living at the address
 
03:19:23.590 --> 03:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
for over 10
 
03:19:26.309 --> 03:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
years thank you for that question and my
 
03:19:27.590 --> 03:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
answer will be a little bit complicated
 
03:19:29.590 --> 03:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
but first I want to I want to flip the
 
03:19:31.630 --> 03:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
concept and say I'm not actually trying
 
03:19:33.150 --> 03:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
to prevent that circumstance I'm trying
 
03:19:35.269 --> 03:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
to incentivize that circumstance because
 
03:19:37.110 --> 03:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
I would like to see our elderly being
 
03:19:40.189 --> 03:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
cared for by family members if possible
 
03:19:42.630 --> 03:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
however there is there is within this
 
03:19:45.750 --> 03:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
bill the 2-year period of time during
 
03:19:48.469 --> 03:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
which the Exempted sinking person must
 
03:19:51.590 --> 03:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
be listed as a owner on the property in
 
03:19:53.550 --> 03:19:53.560 align:start position:0%
question before they would be eligible
 
03:19:57.510 --> 03:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
for um for that exemption
 
03:20:00.630 --> 03:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
followup yes the reason I asked that
 
03:20:04.910 --> 03:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
question is as I have seen in many cases
 
03:20:09.070 --> 03:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
the other end of the age Spectrum where
 
03:20:12.309 --> 03:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
kids are moving in with
 
03:20:14.910 --> 03:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
Grandma uh in order
 
03:20:19.389 --> 03:20:19.399 align:start position:0%
to um gain name the the school location
 
03:20:21.510 --> 03:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
say that well you you can go to our
 
03:20:25.790 --> 03:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
school in our in our town uh and I know
 
03:20:28.870 --> 03:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
this is not what you're proposing but
 
03:20:31.309 --> 03:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
it's on the same concept of gaming the
 
03:20:34.229 --> 03:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
system you you can gain the address as
 
03:20:36.389 --> 03:20:36.399 align:start position:0%
long as you sleep in that in that house
 
03:20:39.309 --> 03:20:39.319 align:start position:0%
two or three nights a week you now can
 
03:20:44.630 --> 03:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
can go to school and absorb the tax uh
 
03:20:47.389 --> 03:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
consequences of of uh
 
03:20:49.510 --> 03:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
getting schooled in our community
 
03:20:52.830 --> 03:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
without actually owning a home or living
 
03:20:55.830 --> 03:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
in the in the community uh for very long
 
03:20:58.189 --> 03:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
and I I'm just concerned about gaming
 
03:21:00.070 --> 03:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
the system in order to get around some
 
03:21:02.150 --> 03:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
of these L thank you I I think I can
 
03:21:03.630 --> 03:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
respond to the specific circumstance
 
03:21:04.910 --> 03:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
you're looking at actually I think it
 
03:21:06.630 --> 03:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
would disincentivize something like that
 
03:21:08.990 --> 03:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
from happening because under current
 
03:21:11.790 --> 03:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances an elderly person um with
 
03:21:14.870 --> 03:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
no tax exemption uh would seemingly have
 
03:21:16.670 --> 03:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
a greater incentive to have a grandson
 
03:21:18.269 --> 03:21:18.279 align:start position:0%
granddaughter move in with them to
 
03:21:19.550 --> 03:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
potentially help
 
03:21:23.469 --> 03:21:23.479 align:start position:0%
financially um then they might be if
 
03:21:24.870 --> 03:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
they receive the exemption and didn't
 
03:21:27.070 --> 03:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
need the financial support um but in
 
03:21:29.269 --> 03:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
either case there's no concrete barrier
 
03:21:31.830 --> 03:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
to a grandchild or child moving in with
 
03:21:34.269 --> 03:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
them to utilize the the school district
 
03:21:36.030 --> 03:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
so I don't think that specifically is
 
03:21:37.910 --> 03:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
applicable to this but the broader
 
03:21:39.750 --> 03:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
context I think it it does reverse and
 
03:21:43.590 --> 03:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
disincentivizes it thank
 
03:21:47.429 --> 03:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
you representative Walker
 
03:21:51.189 --> 03:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
yes uh the definition of homeowner is a
 
03:21:53.070 --> 03:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
little ambiguous to me but because what
 
03:21:55.150 --> 03:21:55.160 align:start position:0%
if uh I'm an elderly person I have my
 
03:21:57.590 --> 03:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
house in a trust so my name's no longer
 
03:22:01.630 --> 03:22:01.640 align:start position:0%
on the deed the trust is or if I turn it
 
03:22:03.630 --> 03:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
over to my son or daughter or whatever
 
03:22:06.950 --> 03:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
and I have lifetime tency that's not
 
03:22:09.189 --> 03:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
addressed in this as
 
03:22:11.550 --> 03:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
well correct and and thank you for the
 
03:22:13.870 --> 03:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
question and that was on purpose um
 
03:22:15.550 --> 03:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
because a trust is already an instrument
 
03:22:18.870 --> 03:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
designed to um limit tax burdens under
 
03:22:20.870 --> 03:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances the idea was not
 
03:22:23.070 --> 03:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
to further incentivize trust but to
 
03:22:25.670 --> 03:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
incentivize an owner just your average
 
03:22:28.150 --> 03:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
your average elderly person um to be
 
03:22:32.790 --> 03:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:35.030 --> 03:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
home further
 
03:22:37.469 --> 03:22:37.479 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:22:39.550 --> 03:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:22:42.189 --> 03:22:42.199 align:start position:0%
you again for taking another
 
03:22:47.710 --> 03:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
question I'm stuck on the number 72
 
03:22:50.670 --> 03:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
somehow that doesn't ring the elderly
 
03:22:53.910 --> 03:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
Bell for me and I'm wondering why you
 
03:22:56.469 --> 03:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
chose that number thank you for the
 
03:22:58.710 --> 03:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
question um that's a very good question
 
03:23:00.950 --> 03:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
actually it almost seems arbitrary
 
03:23:02.110 --> 03:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
except there was an awful lot of
 
03:23:05.389 --> 03:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
research put in um in order to try to
 
03:23:10.269 --> 03:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
balance the desire to limit the taxing
 
03:23:12.150 --> 03:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
of of elderly persons to allow them to
 
03:23:14.429 --> 03:23:14.439 align:start position:0%
stay in their home versus the immediate
 
03:23:20.469 --> 03:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:24.309 --> 03:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
the chair rep recognizes representative
 
03:23:26.229 --> 03:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
Colby thank you
 
03:23:28.510 --> 03:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
03:23:30.229 --> 03:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
so in
 
03:23:32.510 --> 03:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
2023 and you probably saw this in all
 
03:23:34.990 --> 03:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
your research uh
 
03:23:35.000 --> 03:23:37.349 align:start position:0%
your research uh
$1.1

03:23:37.349 --> 03:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
$1.1
 
03:23:39.670 --> 03:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
billion uh was
 
03:23:42.189 --> 03:23:42.199 align:start position:0%
Exempted uh for through the elderly
 
03:23:44.309 --> 03:23:44.319 align:start position:0%
exemptions that exist in
 
03:23:47.150 --> 03:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities um that's Statewide
 
03:23:49.990 --> 03:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
we also see that
 
03:23:54.309 --> 03:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh the number of adults that are aged 60
 
03:23:59.469 --> 03:23:59.479 align:start position:0%
to 64 years old and 65 to 69 years old
 
03:23:59.479 --> 03:24:01.189 align:start position:0%
to 64 years old and 65 to 69 years old
are

03:24:01.189 --> 03:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:24:06.110 --> 03:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
the highest percentage of population in
 
03:24:09.110 --> 03:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
the state what are the projections if
 
03:24:12.349 --> 03:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:15.950 --> 03:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
of how much that 1.1 million will or
 
03:24:19.429 --> 03:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:21.790 --> 03:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
increase uh thank you for the question I
 
03:24:24.030 --> 03:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
I don't have an easy answer for that
 
03:24:25.830 --> 03:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's complicated for a lot of reasons
 
03:24:27.429 --> 03:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
first of which is you
 
03:24:29.830 --> 03:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
can't even in the maximalist sense you
 
03:24:31.349 --> 03:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
can't just assume that every person who
 
03:24:32.670 --> 03:24:32.680 align:start position:0%
would qualify would take this and that
 
03:24:34.110 --> 03:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
would increase the burden because a lot
 
03:24:35.710 --> 03:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
of these people are already probably
 
03:24:38.349 --> 03:24:38.359 align:start position:0%
receiving tax exemptions under current
 
03:24:39.950 --> 03:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
exemptions so you would have to
 
03:24:41.790 --> 03:24:41.800 align:start position:0%
calculate that into the into the full
 
03:24:43.469 --> 03:24:43.479 align:start position:0%
picture I have no doubt that it would
 
03:24:45.830 --> 03:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
increase it by exactly how much I don't
 
03:24:45.840 --> 03:24:50.590 align:start position:0%
increase it by exactly how much I don't
know

03:24:50.590 --> 03:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:55.349 --> 03:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:58.110 --> 03:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you madam chair
 
03:25:01.750 --> 03:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative y72 uh there are people
 
03:25:04.630 --> 03:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
now early onset Alzheimer's or other
 
03:25:07.110 --> 03:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
types of dementia and that can happen
 
03:25:11.070 --> 03:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
anyways between ages 58 plus um is there
 
03:25:12.910 --> 03:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
any exemption for
 
03:25:15.550 --> 03:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question uh just
 
03:25:17.670 --> 03:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
to be clear this this bill is in no way
 
03:25:20.670 --> 03:25:20.680 align:start position:0%
targeted toward uh disability or any
 
03:25:22.910 --> 03:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
other status I believe those already
 
03:25:26.750 --> 03:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
exist in law um as it currently is this
 
03:25:30.710 --> 03:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
is designed as a blanket Universal age
 
03:25:33.510 --> 03:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
72 plus and the number I'm not
 
03:25:35.189 --> 03:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily married to the number if the
 
03:25:36.590 --> 03:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
committee wanted to alter the number
 
03:25:38.229 --> 03:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
somewhat that's that's within your
 
03:25:40.429 --> 03:25:40.439 align:start position:0%
purview um but it's not it's not
 
03:25:42.870 --> 03:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
designed to be a disability uh exemption
 
03:25:47.349 --> 03:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:50.349 --> 03:25:50.359 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie has a
 
03:25:53.110 --> 03:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair and I
 
03:25:55.910 --> 03:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
apologize for being late and a question
 
03:25:58.750 --> 03:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
may have already been asked but uh it
 
03:26:01.750 --> 03:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't answered for me so thank you for
 
03:26:04.590 --> 03:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative I
 
03:26:07.630 --> 03:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
don't see any reference to
 
03:26:11.349 --> 03:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
Financial in this bill no Financial
 
03:26:13.910 --> 03:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
requirement on the petitioner for an
 
03:26:18.189 --> 03:26:18.199 align:start position:0%
abatement is is that on purpose
 
03:26:20.790 --> 03:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question yes the
 
03:26:22.510 --> 03:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
the point of this bill the point of
 
03:26:24.830 --> 03:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
introducing this was not to create yet
 
03:26:27.830 --> 03:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
another Progressive means tested tax
 
03:26:30.229 --> 03:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
exemption this was to meant to create a
 
03:26:31.990 --> 03:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
blanket exemption based on age and
 
03:26:33.349 --> 03:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
length of residency and the other
 
03:26:34.630 --> 03:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
factors that were
 
03:26:38.590 --> 03:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
involved followup Madam chair yes is it
 
03:26:41.750 --> 03:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
clear to me uh to should it be clear to
 
03:26:47.469 --> 03:26:47.479 align:start position:0%
me that if I'm 72 or older and I own the
 
03:26:53.710 --> 03:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:55.870 --> 03:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
exemption thank you for the question
 
03:26:59.469 --> 03:26:59.479 align:start position:0%

03:27:05.750 --> 03:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
exemption for and your local government

M chairwoman and thank you to the
 
03:27:49.070 --> 03:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
committee again again Brody des's from
 
03:27:50.630 --> 03:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire Municipal
 
03:27:53.630 --> 03:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
Association um we are opposed to the
 
03:27:55.830 --> 03:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
bill um I know it's a local option but
 
03:27:58.150 --> 03:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
we do have in our legislative policy
 
03:27:59.910 --> 03:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
positions um that I handed out in our
 
03:28:02.429 --> 03:28:02.439 align:start position:0%
statements of belief set um we don't
 
03:28:04.950 --> 03:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
just support every local option that the
 
03:28:07.189 --> 03:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
legislature seeks to provide and we have
 
03:28:10.429 --> 03:28:10.439 align:start position:0%
some um concerns with this legislation
 
03:28:12.229 --> 03:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
as written and if a town were to adopt
 
03:28:14.750 --> 03:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
it due to several um gray areas let me
 
03:28:17.389 --> 03:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
just get my notes open so I don't forget
 
03:28:20.750 --> 03:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
anything um well first is the tax burden
 
03:28:22.030 --> 03:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
ship that's something that many of you
 
03:28:23.750 --> 03:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
have served in this committee for you
 
03:28:26.590 --> 03:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
know you know numerous terms would
 
03:28:28.229 --> 03:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
recognize that we usually come forward
 
03:28:30.670 --> 03:28:30.680 align:start position:0%
and mention that um there would be a
 
03:28:32.510 --> 03:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
large tax burden shift from those who
 
03:28:33.870 --> 03:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
would now be Exempted from paying
 
03:28:35.670 --> 03:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
property taxes to those who will have to
 
03:28:37.750 --> 03:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
continue paying property taxes um it's
 
03:28:39.150 --> 03:28:39.160 align:start position:0%
not quite clear how big that burden
 
03:28:40.590 --> 03:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
shift would be but based on the fact
 
03:28:42.510 --> 03:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
that there's not any means testing to
 
03:28:44.389 --> 03:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
this property tax exemption like most of
 
03:28:46.189 --> 03:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
ours do in the state of New Hampshire if
 
03:28:48.590 --> 03:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
could be a very broad uh group of
 
03:28:49.870 --> 03:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers that would all of a
 
03:28:51.550 --> 03:28:51.560 align:start position:0%
sudden um
 
03:28:53.870 --> 03:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
$530,000 of their assessed property
 
03:28:56.110 --> 03:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
value would be Exempted from Taxation
 
03:28:58.030 --> 03:28:58.040 align:start position:0%
and all of that would have to shift to
 
03:28:59.750 --> 03:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
those who don't qualify for the tax so
 
03:29:00.950 --> 03:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
those um who don't meet the
 
03:29:03.389 --> 03:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
qualifications of this bill regarding um
 
03:29:06.750 --> 03:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
state residency duration um duration in
 
03:29:09.269 --> 03:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
the residence and also um the other
 
03:29:12.710 --> 03:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
duration requirement um it's also a
 
03:29:16.550 --> 03:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
little bit confusing and ambiguous um in
 
03:29:20.830 --> 03:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
section 2 uh subsection b um the
 
03:29:22.469 --> 03:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
exemption language it's there's an
 
03:29:25.110 --> 03:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
exemption to the exemption is kind of
 
03:29:27.389 --> 03:29:27.399 align:start position:0%
what we talked about internally and we
 
03:29:29.110 --> 03:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
believe would be very tough for some of
 
03:29:31.550 --> 03:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
our assessors whether it's private or um
 
03:29:32.790 --> 03:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
your assessing Department if you have
 
03:29:34.670 --> 03:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
your own assessor hired in House at a
 
03:29:37.309 --> 03:29:37.319 align:start position:0%
municipality to um interpret this and
 
03:29:38.590 --> 03:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
there'd be a lot of reporting
 
03:29:40.469 --> 03:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
requirements for property owners and
 
03:29:41.950 --> 03:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
assessors would have to really chase
 
03:29:43.469 --> 03:29:43.479 align:start position:0%
down those reporting requirements think
 
03:29:46.389 --> 03:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
about the um the charitable and Rel just
 
03:29:48.349 --> 03:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
tax exemption where organizations have
 
03:29:50.070 --> 03:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
to fill it an A9 and an a12 you would
 
03:29:51.070 --> 03:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
have to have similar reporting
 
03:29:53.590 --> 03:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
requirements for something like this um
 
03:29:55.670 --> 03:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
there is also an existing elderly tax
 
03:29:58.550 --> 03:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
exemption RSA 72 col
 
03:30:01.670 --> 03:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
39-a um and in you know with most of our
 
03:30:03.429 --> 03:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
tax exemption statutes in the state of
 
03:30:05.229 --> 03:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if I'm not mistaken all there
 
03:30:07.349 --> 03:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
are means testing so you know you have
 
03:30:09.070 --> 03:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
to make under a certain amount in salary
 
03:30:12.710 --> 03:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
per year and have a certain amount of um
 
03:30:14.389 --> 03:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
of assets that are considered and there
 
03:30:16.389 --> 03:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
is reporting requirements to the towns
 
03:30:18.189 --> 03:30:18.199 align:start position:0%
and ultimately to Department of Revenue
 
03:30:20.309 --> 03:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
Administration so due to some of the
 
03:30:22.309 --> 03:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
ambiguities in how you would be
 
03:30:23.590 --> 03:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
essentially determining someone's
 
03:30:25.950 --> 03:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
residence the um the amount of reporting
 
03:30:27.469 --> 03:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
requirements to go to those different
 
03:30:29.349 --> 03:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
property owners and figure out if they
 
03:30:32.070 --> 03:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
really do um meet the qualifications to
 
03:30:35.389 --> 03:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
meet this uh this tax exemption um in
 
03:30:37.670 --> 03:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
some towns it would just be extremely
 
03:30:39.710 --> 03:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to apply this law and
 
03:30:41.550 --> 03:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
yes it is a local option but with any
 
03:30:42.990 --> 03:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
local option it could be petition worn
 
03:30:45.590 --> 03:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
article so a town could say well we're
 
03:30:48.189 --> 03:30:48.199 align:start position:0%
100% % not sure that we could implement
 
03:30:49.710 --> 03:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
this properly or be able to have the
 
03:30:51.070 --> 03:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
capacity to make sure it's done
 
03:30:54.110 --> 03:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
correctly and um you know tax exemptions
 
03:30:56.110 --> 03:30:56.120 align:start position:0%
are popular no one likes paying taxes
 
03:30:57.710 --> 03:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
but we recognize we have to pay taxes
 
03:31:00.389 --> 03:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
for um basic services that Society needs
 
03:31:02.150 --> 03:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
to function and there'd be a fear that
 
03:31:03.790 --> 03:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden that tax burden for
 
03:31:05.269 --> 03:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
paying for those basic functions of
 
03:31:06.950 --> 03:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
society would be shifted to one
 
03:31:08.710 --> 03:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
classification of taxpayers versus
 
03:31:12.269 --> 03:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
another um so for for those reasons um
 
03:31:14.469 --> 03:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire Municipal Association is
 
03:31:15.910 --> 03:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
opposed and I'd be happy to answer
 
03:31:18.070 --> 03:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
answer any questions or clarify anything
 
03:31:22.189 --> 03:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
if people um yes thank you Mr Dees the
 
03:31:25.110 --> 03:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative
 
03:31:28.070 --> 03:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you Mo Madam chairman and
 
03:31:31.950 --> 03:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh
 
03:31:35.870 --> 03:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
would you believe that in my town two uh
 
03:31:38.950 --> 03:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
years in a row there was an article in
 
03:31:42.110 --> 03:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
the warrant that do exactly this and IR
 
03:31:45.389 --> 03:31:45.399 align:start position:0%
rationale was these people have already
 
03:31:48.030 --> 03:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
paid for for their children actually it
 
03:31:50.189 --> 03:31:50.199 align:start position:0%
was just taking the school part of the
 
03:31:52.070 --> 03:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
budget not the rest of the school part
 
03:31:56.229 --> 03:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
of the uh cost not just not the town but
 
03:31:59.750 --> 03:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
is this a sort of a backdoor thing to do
 
03:32:03.070 --> 03:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
that is the rationale for this bill or
 
03:32:05.950 --> 03:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
could the rationale for this bill to be
 
03:32:09.070 --> 03:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
accepted based on the these elderly
 
03:32:11.870 --> 03:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
people like me have already paid their
 
03:32:14.550 --> 03:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
share to the community they've lived in
 
03:32:17.110 --> 03:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
for 10 years and are entitled to not
 
03:32:21.429 --> 03:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
have to pay for the running of the town
 
03:32:23.469 --> 03:32:23.479 align:start position:0%
from now on because they've paid their
 
03:32:25.910 --> 03:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
dues thank you for your question
 
03:32:28.070 --> 03:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative um I can't speak to the
 
03:32:30.550 --> 03:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill in so far as what the
 
03:32:32.910 --> 03:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
um the sponsor has explained to you guys
 
03:32:35.790 --> 03:32:35.800 align:start position:0%
what his intent is um I can say though
 
03:32:38.429 --> 03:32:38.439 align:start position:0%
that everyone in a municipality utilizes
 
03:32:41.189 --> 03:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
Municipal services to varying degrees
 
03:32:43.950 --> 03:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
and no matter their age so you know for
 
03:32:46.429 --> 03:32:46.439 align:start position:0%
example an ambulance service you know
 
03:32:48.229 --> 03:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
municipality is going to have a contract
 
03:32:50.950 --> 03:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
with a ambulance service or going to
 
03:32:51.950 --> 03:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
want to have their own in-house
 
03:32:54.030 --> 03:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
ambulance service because while it might
 
03:32:56.510 --> 03:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
be more likely that someone who is older
 
03:32:58.710 --> 03:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
might need the ambulance more than me I
 
03:33:00.389 --> 03:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
still will need an ambulance if I fall
 
03:33:02.870 --> 03:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
and break my leg so it's good for at
 
03:33:04.590 --> 03:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
least our position for everyone to be
 
03:33:06.110 --> 03:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
contributing towards the services that
 
03:33:09.550 --> 03:33:09.560 align:start position:0%
they all utilize thank
 
03:33:12.389 --> 03:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
you the chair before we proceed the
 
03:33:14.750 --> 03:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
chair has a reminder for committee
 
03:33:17.309 --> 03:33:17.319 align:start position:0%
members would you believe questions are
 
03:33:20.150 --> 03:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
not permitted in this committee and I
 
03:33:23.189 --> 03:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
will we'll give representative Guthrie
 
03:33:26.790 --> 03:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
one pass on that I'm entitled thank you
 
03:33:27.320 --> 03:33:27.330 align:start position:0%
yes you
 
03:33:27.330 --> 03:33:29.349 align:start position:0%
yes you
[Laughter]

03:33:29.349 --> 03:33:29.359 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:33:32.630 --> 03:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
are the chair recognizes representative
 
03:33:35.550 --> 03:33:35.560 align:start position:0%
majori thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:33:38.309 --> 03:33:38.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr Shan for taking my question um as
 
03:33:40.309 --> 03:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
you stated we already have an elderly
 
03:33:44.950 --> 03:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
tax exemption in statute 793 uh 7239 a
 
03:33:47.150 --> 03:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
if this were to if this bill in front of
 
03:33:49.590 --> 03:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
us were to pass and it were to be
 
03:33:52.910 --> 03:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
adopted in a town would would this do do
 
03:33:55.710 --> 03:33:55.720 align:start position:0%
you believe and does nhma believe that
 
03:33:56.990 --> 03:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
these would
 
03:33:59.790 --> 03:33:59.800 align:start position:0%
act together or would it be one or the
 
03:34:02.150 --> 03:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
other or would it just be
 
03:34:04.510 --> 03:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
conflict that would um that's a very
 
03:34:06.030 --> 03:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
good question I think the way we would
 
03:34:08.030 --> 03:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
interpret it is that they would work
 
03:34:10.510 --> 03:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
together but um that's honestly may be a
 
03:34:11.790 --> 03:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
better question for the Department of
 
03:34:13.910 --> 03:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
Revenue administration's Council um they
 
03:34:15.389 --> 03:34:15.399 align:start position:0%
might want to weigh in on something like
 
03:34:18.269 --> 03:34:18.279 align:start position:0%
this but but um I think our our personal
 
03:34:20.269 --> 03:34:20.279 align:start position:0%
position and our take would be that this
 
03:34:21.870 --> 03:34:21.880 align:start position:0%
would they would be together so you
 
03:34:24.269 --> 03:34:24.279 align:start position:0%
could apply for the existing um elderly
 
03:34:25.750 --> 03:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
tax exemption under
 
03:34:29.389 --> 03:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
72 39-a and then there would be this
 
03:34:31.710 --> 03:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
additional one that again is very broad
 
03:34:34.229 --> 03:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
so you'd have um you know it's you can't
 
03:34:35.389 --> 03:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
know what you don't know so we don't
 
03:34:36.510 --> 03:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
know how many people would be able to
 
03:34:38.630 --> 03:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
qualify for this but just looking at and
 
03:34:40.510 --> 03:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
how broad it is and there being no
 
03:34:43.269 --> 03:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
income or asset um means testing it
 
03:34:45.309 --> 03:34:45.319 align:start position:0%
would be a lot of people and it would
 
03:34:47.550 --> 03:34:47.560 align:start position:0%
depend on municipality too for example
 
03:34:49.710 --> 03:34:49.720 align:start position:0%
wolfboro we have an average um we have a
 
03:34:51.630 --> 03:34:51.640 align:start position:0%
higher average age than most
 
03:34:53.670 --> 03:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities so me being a younger
 
03:34:55.030 --> 03:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayer I might get whacked a little
 
03:34:57.910 --> 03:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
bit harder if this was implemented in my
 
03:35:01.150 --> 03:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
town further
 
03:35:03.830 --> 03:35:03.840 align:start position:0%

been
 
03:38:59.189 --> 03:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
presented which would allow County
 
03:39:01.469 --> 03:39:01.479 align:start position:0%
government to establish a revolving
 
03:39:04.830 --> 03:39:04.840 align:start position:0%

03:39:14.590 --> 03:39:14.600 align:start position:0%

03:39:16.950 --> 03:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
which will allow counties government to
 
03:39:19.389 --> 03:39:19.399 align:start position:0%

details as our local and State uh
 
03:39:27.469 --> 03:39:27.479 align:start position:0%
entities already have the um this under
 
03:39:33.229 --> 03:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
their um Wing they're able to um perform
 
03:39:36.910 --> 03:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
this this bill is not a a required bill
 
03:39:39.110 --> 03:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
it will be up to each County to decide
 
03:39:41.550 --> 03:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
if they would like to uh
 
03:39:44.229 --> 03:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
participate um if this um bill becomes
 
03:39:44.239 --> 03:39:45.870 align:start position:0%
participate um if this um bill becomes
law

03:39:45.870 --> 03:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:39:47.950 --> 03:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
the way the county law is written now it
 
03:39:50.550 --> 03:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
does not allow County government to
 
03:39:53.950 --> 03:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
adopt this practice which becomes a
 
03:39:55.550 --> 03:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
burden on
 
03:39:58.189 --> 03:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers if this bill is passed in the
 
03:40:00.750 --> 03:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
County government across the state
 
03:40:04.389 --> 03:40:04.399 align:start position:0%
chooses to participate it would allow
 
03:40:07.710 --> 03:40:07.720 align:start position:0%
department heads to reduce their budgets
 
03:40:10.030 --> 03:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
by not having to request large
 
03:40:12.550 --> 03:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
Appropriations in certain
 
03:40:15.429 --> 03:40:15.439 align:start position:0%
lines which will in turn save taxpayers
 
03:40:17.590 --> 03:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
is money this bill would allow
 
03:40:20.269 --> 03:40:20.279 align:start position:0%
significant lower funding in certain
 
03:40:22.870 --> 03:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
lines knowing it will be replenished
 
03:40:25.630 --> 03:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
when revenue is collected for services
 
03:40:29.269 --> 03:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
provided outside the normal duties or
 
03:40:32.309 --> 03:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
requirements of law enforcement agencies
 
03:40:34.469 --> 03:40:34.479 align:start position:0%
department heads would not need to
 
03:40:37.110 --> 03:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
request additional funding for the
 
03:40:37.120 --> 03:40:38.510 align:start position:0%
request additional funding for the
County

03:40:38.510 --> 03:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
County
 
03:40:41.710 --> 03:40:41.720 align:start position:0%
Commissioners um in the um process or in
 
03:40:44.510 --> 03:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
the event that they overspend that line
 
03:40:44.520 --> 03:40:46.150 align:start position:0%
the event that they overspend that line
item

03:40:46.150 --> 03:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
item
 
03:40:47.990 --> 03:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
many Sheriff's departments across the
 
03:40:50.670 --> 03:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
state have been requested by local and
 
03:40:53.750 --> 03:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
state law enforcement agencies to assist
 
03:40:56.309 --> 03:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
with patrol coverage and private paid
 
03:40:56.319 --> 03:40:57.429 align:start position:0%
with patrol coverage and private paid
outside

03:40:57.429 --> 03:40:57.439 align:start position:0%
outside
 
03:41:00.990 --> 03:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
details due to the shortage of Manpower
 
03:41:04.950 --> 03:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
or the inability to hire
 
03:41:07.630 --> 03:41:07.640 align:start position:0%
offices these agencies are relying on
 
03:41:10.030 --> 03:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
county level um law enforcement agencies
 
03:41:12.910 --> 03:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
to assist with coverage and Public
 
03:41:16.309 --> 03:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
Safety whereby county law
 
03:41:18.710 --> 03:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement has Statewide
 
03:41:21.469 --> 03:41:21.479 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions however under the current
 
03:41:24.710 --> 03:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
law if the fund are
 
03:41:24.720 --> 03:41:26.389 align:start position:0%
law if the fund are
expended

03:41:26.389 --> 03:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
expended
 
03:41:29.790 --> 03:41:29.800 align:start position:0%
um County Law Enforcement must refuse to
 
03:41:31.469 --> 03:41:31.479 align:start position:0%
provide these Services if they did not
 
03:41:36.309 --> 03:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
have the funds to do so um to ensure the
 
03:41:38.710 --> 03:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
safety okay fostering Economic
 
03:41:40.950 --> 03:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
Development and ensuring critical
 
03:41:43.830 --> 03:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is not
 
03:41:46.750 --> 03:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
delayed yes the department head may go
 
03:41:48.670 --> 03:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
before the County Commissioners or
 
03:41:51.269 --> 03:41:51.279 align:start position:0%
delegation to ask for more money which
 
03:41:55.030 --> 03:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
would delay um deputies or law
 
03:41:57.110 --> 03:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement at the county level to be
 
03:42:00.349 --> 03:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
able to uh perform these extra duties
 
03:42:02.710 --> 03:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
due to the shortage of funds for an
 
03:42:06.070 --> 03:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
example say if a private company that is
 
03:42:08.030 --> 03:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
working on a bridge here in New
 
03:42:10.110 --> 03:42:10.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or any other state around us
 
03:42:12.229 --> 03:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
and have to come through New Hampshire
 
03:42:16.750 --> 03:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
there are um dot rules that require that
 
03:42:19.950 --> 03:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
they get permits and that they hire law
 
03:42:23.149 --> 03:42:23.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement to escort them which under
 
03:42:25.030 --> 03:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
the rule it says State
 
03:42:28.149 --> 03:42:28.159 align:start position:0%
Police where there's shortage at State
 
03:42:31.149 --> 03:42:31.159 align:start position:0%
Police they have been relying on County
 
03:42:33.750 --> 03:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
agencies to provide these services to
 
03:42:35.790 --> 03:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
ensure the products get to their job
 
03:42:37.510 --> 03:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
site in a timely
 
03:42:42.030 --> 03:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
fashion um whereas I said the counties
 
03:42:44.349 --> 03:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
do not have a revolving fund they budget
 
03:42:46.429 --> 03:42:46.439 align:start position:0%
for a certain amount amount and if that
 
03:42:49.510 --> 03:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
is spent at that point they have to turn
 
03:42:55.710 --> 03:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:58.990 --> 03:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
jobs um at this point you know that's
 
03:43:01.550 --> 03:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
pretty much the um T of the bill it is
 
03:43:03.349 --> 03:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
not mandatory that any County
 
03:43:05.550 --> 03:43:05.560 align:start position:0%
participates but it's their option if
 
03:43:08.710 --> 03:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
they would like to with this type of um
 
03:43:11.910 --> 03:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
fund for an example if all of a sudden
 
03:43:13.910 --> 03:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
um say a county says we're going to give
 
03:43:15.750 --> 03:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
you $20,000
 
03:43:17.590 --> 03:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
we know that's going to be there once
 
03:43:19.830 --> 03:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
they bill out to these private
 
03:43:23.510 --> 03:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
companies and they pay back they'll keep
 
03:43:25.710 --> 03:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
that the money will go back whatever
 
03:43:28.550 --> 03:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
they use to keep that level of $20,000
 
03:43:31.429 --> 03:43:31.439 align:start position:0%
funding and the rest would go into the
 
03:43:35.510 --> 03:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
general fund to help offset cost um and
 
03:43:38.110 --> 03:43:38.120 align:start position:0%
taxes so I ask this committee to please
 
03:43:40.269 --> 03:43:40.279 align:start position:0%
pass House Bill 110 and allow County
 
03:43:42.189 --> 03:43:42.199 align:start position:0%
government the right to establish
 
03:43:45.670 --> 03:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
revolving funds as municipal state
 
03:43:48.389 --> 03:43:48.399 align:start position:0%
agencies are already doing thank you and
 
03:43:50.790 --> 03:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
I will take questions thank you
 
03:43:52.630 --> 03:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
representative Traer for your bill
 
03:43:57.550 --> 03:43:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:00.750 --> 03:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Walker yes thank
 
03:44:02.710 --> 03:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
you madam
 
03:44:06.349 --> 03:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
shair revolving funds so what if I'm a
 
03:44:09.670 --> 03:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
county well that's if I over over
 
03:44:12.309 --> 03:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate into that revolving fund can
 
03:44:14.790 --> 03:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
that money be shifted to another another
 
03:44:19.149 --> 03:44:19.159 align:start position:0%
AG or another uh project or
 
03:44:21.710 --> 03:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
department so if I understand you right
 
03:44:24.910 --> 03:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
so if all of a sudden a county decides
 
03:44:28.309 --> 03:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
they're going to give $20,000 for that
 
03:44:31.670 --> 03:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
revolving fund correct correct and at
 
03:44:31.680 --> 03:44:32.830 align:start position:0%
revolving fund correct correct and at
that

03:44:32.830 --> 03:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:44:36.710 --> 03:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
point if they hire outside details for
 
03:44:40.550 --> 03:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
offices that 20,000 will always be there
 
03:44:43.870 --> 03:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
any extra money that is earned will go
 
03:44:45.630 --> 03:44:45.640 align:start position:0%
to the general fund
 
03:44:47.389 --> 03:44:47.399 align:start position:0%
and at that point it'll be up to the
 
03:44:51.229 --> 03:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and or delegations to um
 
03:44:52.469 --> 03:44:52.479 align:start position:0%
appropriate that money at the
 
03:44:52.479 --> 03:44:56.750 align:start position:0%
appropriate that money at the
appropriate

03:44:56.750 --> 03:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:59.070 --> 03:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
times the chair recognizes
 
03:45:02.590 --> 03:45:02.600 align:start position:0%
representative Colby thank you um who
 
03:45:04.710 --> 03:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
would you be proposing the authorized
 
03:45:07.790 --> 03:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
agents would be to expend those
 
03:45:11.429 --> 03:45:11.439 align:start position:0%
funds so for an example the sheriff's
 
03:45:13.790 --> 03:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
department at the you know their budget
 
03:45:16.429 --> 03:45:16.439 align:start position:0%
process they'll have a line item named
 
03:45:20.750 --> 03:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
under you know a detail expending uh
 
03:45:23.790 --> 03:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
expenditure and at that point it'll be
 
03:45:26.910 --> 03:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
up to the sheriff to authorize his
 
03:45:29.189 --> 03:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
employees to be able to work these
 
03:45:31.790 --> 03:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
details but that would be through the
 
03:45:35.510 --> 03:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioners the delegation at the time
 
03:45:37.269 --> 03:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
will determine you know during their
 
03:45:39.149 --> 03:45:39.159 align:start position:0%
budget process if they agree with the
 
03:45:41.229 --> 03:45:41.239 align:start position:0%
amount that the department head has
 
03:45:41.239 --> 03:45:46.870 align:start position:0%
amount that the department head has
requested

03:45:46.870 --> 03:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:46.880 --> 03:45:49.349 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:45:49.349 --> 03:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:45:51.550 --> 03:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:45:54.510 --> 03:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question it it isn't
 
03:45:55.710 --> 03:45:55.720 align:start position:0%
clear to
 
03:45:59.269 --> 03:45:59.279 align:start position:0%
me uh how the money gets taken out of
 
03:45:59.279 --> 03:45:59.950 align:start position:0%
me uh how the money gets taken out of
the

03:45:59.950 --> 03:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:46:04.030 --> 03:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
reserve fund revolving fund it's uh I
 
03:46:06.149 --> 03:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
know we use the same system at at the
 
03:46:08.269 --> 03:46:08.279 align:start position:0%
Town level in many
 
03:46:10.030 --> 03:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
cases tell you the truth I don't
 
03:46:11.469 --> 03:46:11.479 align:start position:0%
particularly like care about it but
 
03:46:14.670 --> 03:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
that's a it seems like SL a slush fund
 
03:46:16.870 --> 03:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
but who would who would have the
 
03:46:19.550 --> 03:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
authority to take the money out of this
 
03:46:23.309 --> 03:46:23.319 align:start position:0%
reol fund and pay for what you're trying
 
03:46:26.750 --> 03:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
to do which is actually still operating
 
03:46:29.910 --> 03:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
correct so good question um
 
03:46:32.149 --> 03:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
representative so basically at that
 
03:46:36.630 --> 03:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
point once a a deputy puts in a pay slip
 
03:46:39.070 --> 03:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
saying he worked this detail it goes
 
03:46:41.149 --> 03:46:41.159 align:start position:0%
through the HR department and it'll be
 
03:46:43.630 --> 03:46:43.640 align:start position:0%
part of their pay so basically the
 
03:46:45.790 --> 03:46:45.800 align:start position:0%
sheriff or the super visor in charge of
 
03:46:48.349 --> 03:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
that will say yes this Deputy worked it
 
03:46:51.389 --> 03:46:51.399 align:start position:0%
approved it it'll be part of um his uh
 
03:46:55.030 --> 03:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
or his or her weekly pay and the HR
 
03:46:57.910 --> 03:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
department will take that money out of
 
03:47:02.429 --> 03:47:02.439 align:start position:0%
that fund follow up Madam chair yes
 
03:47:08.910 --> 03:47:08.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh isn't this really a uh a
 
03:47:11.149 --> 03:47:11.159 align:start position:0%
budget outside the budget if you will
 
03:47:13.630 --> 03:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
that it's just a separate means of
 
03:47:16.070 --> 03:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
paying things
 
03:47:19.630 --> 03:47:19.640 align:start position:0%
and the money going in comes out of the
 
03:47:23.710 --> 03:47:23.720 align:start position:0%
tax levy or whatever but isn't it just a
 
03:47:27.070 --> 03:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
a different way of paying your bills I
 
03:47:29.229 --> 03:47:29.239 align:start position:0%
would say no on that basically it will
 
03:47:33.110 --> 03:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
be a line item that is agreed upon by
 
03:47:36.590 --> 03:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
the County Commissioners and the
 
03:47:36.600 --> 03:47:38.149 align:start position:0%
the County Commissioners and the
delegation

03:47:38.149 --> 03:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
delegation
 
03:47:41.550 --> 03:47:41.560 align:start position:0%
um it's a line item in the budget to pay
 
03:47:45.349 --> 03:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
for outside details or private details
 
03:47:48.309 --> 03:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
that in return the private companies
 
03:47:51.030 --> 03:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
will pay back and it
 
03:47:54.590 --> 03:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
will go back into that line item to the
 
03:47:57.750 --> 03:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
maximum um amount that the Comm uh
 
03:48:00.110 --> 03:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
commission or delegation has agreed upon
 
03:48:02.510 --> 03:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
for an example if all of a sudden the
 
03:48:04.469 --> 03:48:04.479 align:start position:0%
during the budget session they say we're
 
03:48:06.110 --> 03:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
going to give you
 
03:48:10.389 --> 03:48:10.399 align:start position:0%
$20,000 for outside
 
03:48:14.149 --> 03:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
details at that point that $220,000 will
 
03:48:17.110 --> 03:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
pay for the salaries and the um stuff of
 
03:48:18.670 --> 03:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
the deputies that
 
03:48:21.269 --> 03:48:21.279 align:start position:0%
work once that private company that
 
03:48:24.149 --> 03:48:24.159 align:start position:0%
hired the deputies for the um special
 
03:48:27.870 --> 03:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
detail that will go back into that fund
 
03:48:29.990 --> 03:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
and the remainder will go back into the
 
03:48:33.070 --> 03:48:33.080 align:start position:0%
general budget thank you thank you madam
 
03:48:36.429 --> 03:48:36.439 align:start position:0%
chair thank you the chair recognizes
 
03:48:36.439 --> 03:48:37.790 align:start position:0%
chair thank you the chair recognizes
representative

03:48:37.790 --> 03:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:48:39.830 --> 03:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:48:42.510 --> 03:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um how does
 
03:48:44.830 --> 03:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
the fund get established
 
03:48:48.030 --> 03:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
so basically thank you for your question
 
03:48:51.870 --> 03:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
representative um so originally the town
 
03:48:54.030 --> 03:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
will have to adopt this saying yes we
 
03:48:58.389 --> 03:48:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:02.429 --> 03:49:02.439 align:start position:0%
fund yes follow up you said the town but
 
03:49:04.349 --> 03:49:04.359 align:start position:0%
we're talking about counties Sor County
 
03:49:06.469 --> 03:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry my mistake it's County
 
03:49:08.309 --> 03:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
Commission so go back to my question how
 
03:49:10.189 --> 03:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
would the fund get established so
 
03:49:12.830 --> 03:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
basically the the um department head
 
03:49:15.910 --> 03:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
would ask the um County Commission is
 
03:49:18.309 --> 03:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
during their budget to establish a
 
03:49:20.910 --> 03:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
revolving fund
 
03:49:24.349 --> 03:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
line so it would have to be voted on by
 
03:49:26.670 --> 03:49:26.680 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners and that amount of
 
03:49:28.349 --> 03:49:28.359 align:start position:0%
money they agree upon will have to go
 
03:49:30.550 --> 03:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
into the budget and be reviewed by the
 
03:49:30.560 --> 03:49:34.429 align:start position:0%
into the budget and be reviewed by the
um

03:49:34.429 --> 03:49:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:40.429 --> 03:49:40.439 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:49:42.750 --> 03:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
grund yes thank you madam chair and and
 
03:49:45.429 --> 03:49:45.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um so I
 
03:49:47.469 --> 03:49:47.479 align:start position:0%
know what you just explained but in here
 
03:49:51.030 --> 03:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
it says by vote of the legislative body
 
03:49:53.750 --> 03:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
establish a revolving budget expense
 
03:49:57.229 --> 03:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
line so who is the legislative body what
 
03:50:01.269 --> 03:50:01.279 align:start position:0%
is it the county delegation is it uh is
 
03:50:02.550 --> 03:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
a quick question is that in the
 
03:50:05.750 --> 03:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
amendment or is that in the original
 
03:50:08.189 --> 03:50:08.199 align:start position:0%
because in in the handout we just
 
03:50:15.630 --> 03:50:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:18.309 --> 03:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
so the legislative body in my thoughts
 
03:50:22.110 --> 03:50:22.120 align:start position:0%
would be the commission is to accept the
 
03:50:25.990 --> 03:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh or accept this and adopt it as one of
 
03:50:30.389 --> 03:50:30.399 align:start position:0%
their rules but the um review will be
 
03:50:31.349 --> 03:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
from the
 
03:50:33.469 --> 03:50:33.479 align:start position:0%
delegation you know if they agree with
 
03:50:35.990 --> 03:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
the amount that they put in to the
 
03:50:36.000 --> 03:50:45.870 align:start position:0%
the amount that they put in to the
budget

03:50:45.870 --> 03:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:45.880 --> 03:50:48.229 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:50:48.229 --> 03:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:50:50.950 --> 03:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
France does this mean that there's only
 
03:50:50.960 --> 03:50:52.189 align:start position:0%
France does this mean that there's only
one

03:50:52.189 --> 03:50:52.199 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:50:55.469 --> 03:50:55.479 align:start position:0%
initial deposit into this account from
 
03:50:57.149 --> 03:50:57.159 align:start position:0%
the county
 
03:51:00.349 --> 03:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
budget when you establish the account
 
03:51:03.469 --> 03:51:03.479 align:start position:0%
yes there'll be one deposit into that
 
03:51:06.510 --> 03:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
out of taxpayers funds correct thank
 
03:51:08.790 --> 03:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
you further
 
03:51:11.910 --> 03:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative gr thank you
 
03:51:14.149 --> 03:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
again Madam chair and um I don't know if
 
03:51:15.950 --> 03:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
you know this but maybe you do so if
 
03:51:19.269 --> 03:51:19.279 align:start position:0%
there's line item transfers from
 
03:51:22.110 --> 03:51:22.120 align:start position:0%
different accounts can money be
 
03:51:24.110 --> 03:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
transferred out of this public safety
 
03:51:25.870 --> 03:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
account to another
 
03:51:27.710 --> 03:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
account and then this would be
 
03:51:30.710 --> 03:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
reestablished with the fund so you're
 
03:51:30.720 --> 03:51:32.309 align:start position:0%
reestablished with the fund so you're
essentially

03:51:32.309 --> 03:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
03:51:35.870 --> 03:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
moving funding elsewhere accidentally so
 
03:51:37.630 --> 03:51:37.640 align:start position:0%
if I'm understanding you're right yes
 
03:51:39.790 --> 03:51:39.800 align:start position:0%
they can like a department head can go
 
03:51:41.830 --> 03:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
to the Commissioners and ask them to
 
03:51:45.429 --> 03:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
take money out of the unanticipated fund
 
03:51:47.790 --> 03:51:47.800 align:start position:0%
line right I'm I'm asking more about out
 
03:51:49.830 --> 03:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
of the public safety blind item fund
 
03:51:53.309 --> 03:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
let's say okay okay if they need money
 
03:51:56.269 --> 03:51:56.279 align:start position:0%
for heating can they transfer money out
 
03:52:00.149 --> 03:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
of public that Public Safety fund line
 
03:52:03.429 --> 03:52:03.439 align:start position:0%
item to a heating line item and now
 
03:52:05.950 --> 03:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
you're reesta now you're refunding that
 
03:52:05.960 --> 03:52:08.030 align:start position:0%
you're reesta now you're refunding that
account

03:52:08.030 --> 03:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
account
 
03:52:11.149 --> 03:52:11.159 align:start position:0%
with other Revenue that's see how you
 
03:52:12.830 --> 03:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
transferred expense elsewhere that's my
 
03:52:15.670 --> 03:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
concern I mean that would be up to the
 
03:52:17.309 --> 03:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I believe if that's how
 
03:52:19.790 --> 03:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
they want to do it biggest thing here is
 
03:52:22.229 --> 03:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
just keeping a certain amount in this
 
03:52:26.469 --> 03:52:26.479 align:start position:0%
line and once any um revenues brought in
 
03:52:28.670 --> 03:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
above that amount it goes into the
 
03:52:30.550 --> 03:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
general fund I believe the Commissioners
 
03:52:32.830 --> 03:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
can decide what they want to do with
 
03:52:35.750 --> 03:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
it the chair recognizes representative
 
03:52:37.950 --> 03:52:37.960 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:52:39.750 --> 03:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
you once again for taking yet another
 
03:52:41.750 --> 03:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
question so following up on that
 
03:52:45.070 --> 03:52:45.080 align:start position:0%
previous question in Roman numeral 3
 
03:52:46.950 --> 03:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
it says the provisions of this section
 
03:52:49.750 --> 03:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
shall not preclude the establishment of
 
03:52:52.030 --> 03:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
revolving fund for any other purpose
 
03:52:56.349 --> 03:52:56.359 align:start position:0%
authorized by law that confuses me does
 
03:52:58.750 --> 03:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
that mean that you could establish five
 
03:53:01.189 --> 03:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
revolving funds if you have different
 
03:53:04.269 --> 03:53:04.279 align:start position:0%
purposes does it mean that funds from
 
03:53:06.990 --> 03:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
the initial revolving fund can be moved
 
03:53:09.030 --> 03:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
to this revolving fund what does that
 
03:53:23.309 --> 03:53:23.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:25.469 --> 03:53:25.479 align:start position:0%
um that's a good question I would have
 
03:53:27.149 --> 03:53:27.159 align:start position:0%
to look into that a little bit more and
 
03:53:30.750 --> 03:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
think about it um because I believe this
 
03:53:34.910 --> 03:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
was um the my intent was just to have
 
03:53:37.229 --> 03:53:37.239 align:start position:0%
this fund but at that point once it goes
 
03:53:38.910 --> 03:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
into the general fund I believe the
 
03:53:40.590 --> 03:53:40.600 align:start position:0%
commissions if they to say we want to do
 
03:53:45.710 --> 03:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:48.990 --> 03:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:55.710 --> 03:53:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:59.630 --> 03:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
you next I have a pink card from a Mr
 
03:53:59.640 --> 03:54:06.030 align:start position:0%
you next I have a pink card from a Mr
Jim

03:54:06.030 --> 03:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:08.630 --> 03:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
McIntire good afternoon manam chair
 
03:54:11.429 --> 03:54:11.439 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is uh
 
03:54:12.950 --> 03:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
Jim McIntyre I'm the chief Deputy of
 
03:54:14.750 --> 03:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
bnap County Sheriff's Department um I
 
03:54:17.229 --> 03:54:17.239 align:start position:0%
was told to keep it simple uh so I can
 
03:54:19.870 --> 03:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
surely do that for you operationally is
 
03:54:22.110 --> 03:54:22.120 align:start position:0%
why I'm here to testify um the New
 
03:54:23.750 --> 03:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Sheriff's Association is in
 
03:54:29.269 --> 03:54:29.279 align:start position:0%
support of adopting this bill um the the
 
03:54:31.309 --> 03:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
the problem comes with County government
 
03:54:33.990 --> 03:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
is it becomes different than municipal
 
03:54:36.870 --> 03:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
government we currently provide a line
 
03:54:39.149 --> 03:54:39.159 align:start position:0%
item for outside details as projected
 
03:54:40.990 --> 03:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
and that projection is done on best
 
03:54:44.469 --> 03:54:44.479 align:start position:0%
guess scenario so um we have regular
 
03:54:46.070 --> 03:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
details that the sheriff's office would
 
03:54:49.750 --> 03:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
typically um uh handle such as um things
 
03:54:51.349 --> 03:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
like the Mount Washington or things at
 
03:54:53.030 --> 03:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
um in Bap County specifically the um
 
03:54:56.429 --> 03:54:56.439 align:start position:0%
Gunstock ski area uh and so forth what
 
03:54:59.269 --> 03:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
we're finding is um more more
 
03:55:01.469 --> 03:55:01.479 align:start position:0%
departments um state and local
 
03:55:03.030 --> 03:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
departments are needing supplemental
 
03:55:04.910 --> 03:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
help they don't have the manpower to do
 
03:55:06.910 --> 03:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
them so we've actually found ourselves
 
03:55:09.750 --> 03:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
supplementing their their forces in many
 
03:55:12.229 --> 03:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
capacities could be Patrol shifts and we
 
03:55:13.870 --> 03:55:13.880 align:start position:0%
have departments that don't have enough
 
03:55:16.710 --> 03:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
um manpower to cover 24-hour protection
 
03:55:19.030 --> 03:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
they hire our deputies to work those as
 
03:55:21.189 --> 03:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
details when we pay these they come out
 
03:55:24.149 --> 03:55:24.159 align:start position:0%
of our line item of outside details
 
03:55:26.870 --> 03:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
which for a number purpose we had set at
 
03:55:30.630 --> 03:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
$45,000 last year we spent approximately
 
03:55:32.870 --> 03:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
$90,000 to cover that so we're
 
03:55:35.510 --> 03:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
overexpanded in that line item there's
 
03:55:38.030 --> 03:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
no provision for us to recover that
 
03:55:40.950 --> 03:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
money and keep paying details we have to
 
03:55:43.269 --> 03:55:43.279 align:start position:0%
go before the Commissioners and ask for
 
03:55:45.229 --> 03:55:45.239 align:start position:0%
a line transfer or a supplemental
 
03:55:48.429 --> 03:55:48.439 align:start position:0%
appropriation neither one is desirable
 
03:55:52.510 --> 03:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
this is a hope to to basically um have
 
03:55:54.309 --> 03:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
some seed money from the current line
 
03:55:57.469 --> 03:55:57.479 align:start position:0%
item which would be essentially the um
 
03:55:59.670 --> 03:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
$20,000 that representative charia
 
03:56:01.630 --> 03:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned that would be the seed money
 
03:56:04.550 --> 03:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
to start the fund and then as vendors
 
03:56:07.469 --> 03:56:07.479 align:start position:0%
pay their uh pay their bills back that
 
03:56:09.830 --> 03:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
would replenish that $20,000 therefore
 
03:56:12.910 --> 03:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
we'd never go below the 20,000 but there
 
03:56:15.910 --> 03:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
is a residual when you work uh these
 
03:56:18.110 --> 03:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
details um the officer gets paid the
 
03:56:20.550 --> 03:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
benefits get paid retirement gets paid
 
03:56:22.590 --> 03:56:22.600 align:start position:0%
um maintenance and fuel gets paid and
 
03:56:25.030 --> 03:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
then there's uh a residual that would
 
03:56:27.149 --> 03:56:27.159 align:start position:0%
then go into the general fund so I don't
 
03:56:28.349 --> 03:56:28.359 align:start position:0%
know if I'm answering some of the
 
03:56:31.070 --> 03:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
questions I heard earlier but the the
 
03:56:32.349 --> 03:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
process for the
 
03:56:34.550 --> 03:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
Overture still goes to the general fund
 
03:56:35.710 --> 03:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
as it currently
 
03:56:38.469 --> 03:56:38.479 align:start position:0%
does the what this would eliminate is
 
03:56:41.189 --> 03:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
our Sheriff overex spending a line item
 
03:56:43.910 --> 03:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
um that he guesses or us asking for more
 
03:56:43.920 --> 03:56:44.790 align:start position:0%
um that he guesses or us asking for more
money

03:56:44.790 --> 03:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:56:46.510 --> 03:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
that we don't need which would then also
 
03:56:48.510 --> 03:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
go either to another line or general
 
03:56:48.520 --> 03:56:49.710 align:start position:0%
go either to another line or general
fund

03:56:49.710 --> 03:56:49.720 align:start position:0%
fund
 
03:56:55.870 --> 03:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
so does that help explain some of the
 
03:56:58.429 --> 03:56:58.439 align:start position:0%
questions I kind of jump forward but I I
 
03:56:59.750 --> 03:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
feel like there's a lot of questions
 
03:57:02.670 --> 03:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
fresh and uh I may have some operational
 
03:57:06.110 --> 03:57:06.120 align:start position:0%
answers well thank you sir um one thing
 
03:57:07.870 --> 03:57:07.880 align:start position:0%
could you amend your card you said that
 
03:57:10.309 --> 03:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
you were in support of this bill I did
 
03:57:12.309 --> 03:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
could you amend your card and initial it
 
03:57:13.790 --> 03:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
please well I'm going to pass it or when
 
03:57:16.790 --> 03:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
you're done we'll pass it around and
 
03:57:20.510 --> 03:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely questions representative
 
03:57:24.110 --> 03:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you madam
 
03:57:27.149 --> 03:57:27.159 align:start position:0%
chair with and thank you for taking my
 
03:57:28.990 --> 03:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
question and I hope you take it in the
 
03:57:32.670 --> 03:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
right light it seems like with all due
 
03:57:35.550 --> 03:57:35.560 align:start position:0%
respect it looks like you got a real
 
03:57:38.269 --> 03:57:38.279 align:start position:0%
problem between your staff and the
 
03:57:41.269 --> 03:57:41.279 align:start position:0%
Commissioners you'll have a line item
 
03:57:45.389 --> 03:57:45.399 align:start position:0%
that you can't trans you can transfer um
 
03:57:48.750 --> 03:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
as as for there is a process for to
 
03:57:54.349 --> 03:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
recover that $40,000 that you need for
 
03:57:57.149 --> 03:57:57.159 align:start position:0%
details is that correct there is no
 
03:57:58.750 --> 03:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
process that's what this bill addresses
 
03:58:01.590 --> 03:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
sir um the the monies that we recover go
 
03:58:04.149 --> 03:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
direct to the general fund as a as a
 
03:58:06.510 --> 03:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
revenue so that's what we're trying to
 
03:58:09.990 --> 03:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
recover but we can be
 
03:58:13.349 --> 03:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
directed um in essence to overspend that
 
03:58:13.359 --> 03:58:15.149 align:start position:0%
directed um in essence to overspend that
line

03:58:15.149 --> 03:58:15.159 align:start position:0%
line
 
03:58:17.670 --> 03:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
but that's that's the question as are we
 
03:58:19.189 --> 03:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
allowed to overspend the line or is
 
03:58:22.149 --> 03:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
there a law that can Rectify it um this
 
03:58:24.550 --> 03:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
law parallels what municipalities do
 
03:58:28.070 --> 03:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
with revolving funds and I I believe
 
03:58:30.070 --> 03:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
that clarifying it would would leave
 
03:58:33.229 --> 03:58:33.239 align:start position:0%
less guess work and um be a better
 
03:58:36.990 --> 03:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
accounting practice followup Madam chair
 
03:58:39.670 --> 03:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
yes representative isn't there a better
 
03:58:41.790 --> 03:58:41.800 align:start position:0%
solution which would be that your
 
03:58:43.309 --> 03:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
Commissioners when they're looking at
 
03:58:46.309 --> 03:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
their their budget and the legislative
 
03:58:48.070 --> 03:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
body is looking at their leget
 
03:58:51.309 --> 03:58:51.319 align:start position:0%
originally that they actually realized
 
03:58:54.550 --> 03:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
that you're underfunding that line so
 
03:58:55.870 --> 03:58:55.880 align:start position:0%
much so that you're going to have
 
03:58:58.189 --> 03:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
trouble before the end of the year would
 
03:59:01.349 --> 03:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
it be better to have that line
 
03:59:05.710 --> 03:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
stronger so to yes we've we've doubled
 
03:59:07.110 --> 03:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
that line this year but to
 
03:59:09.149 --> 03:59:09.159 align:start position:0%
representative charer Point that's going
 
03:59:11.590 --> 03:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
to have to be funded by the taxpayers
 
03:59:13.550 --> 03:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
through appropriation so they will fund
 
03:59:13.560 --> 03:59:14.630 align:start position:0%
through appropriation so they will fund
80,00

03:59:14.630 --> 03:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
80,00
 
03:59:17.790 --> 03:59:17.800 align:start position:0%
this year versus $20,000 seed so that's
 
03:59:20.710 --> 03:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
where it's a savings to the to the
 
03:59:23.149 --> 03:59:23.159 align:start position:0%
taxpayer thank
 
03:59:26.389 --> 03:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
 
03:59:28.510 --> 03:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
majori thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:59:30.550 --> 03:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question and testify
 
03:59:33.590 --> 03:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
I'm curious I I think I understand who
 
03:59:35.630 --> 03:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
County employees are but I'm not quite
 
03:59:38.309 --> 03:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
sure that I understand who volunteers
 
03:59:41.630 --> 03:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
are acting outside of the ordinary
 
03:59:44.269 --> 03:59:44.279 align:start position:0%
detail of such I believe that that's
 
03:59:47.550 --> 03:59:47.560 align:start position:0%
language to cover outside detail um
 
03:59:49.750 --> 03:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
duties uh where sheriff's deputies are
 
03:59:51.830 --> 03:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
performing you know rits and precepts
 
03:59:54.030 --> 03:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
from the court anything outside of that
 
03:59:55.910 --> 03:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
job description would be a voluntary
 
03:59:57.710 --> 03:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
outside Duty I believe that's what that
 
04:00:00.469 --> 04:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
language is trying to capture yeah okay
 
04:00:03.830 --> 04:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you additional
 
04:00:06.349 --> 04:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:00:09.229 --> 04:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
Gerard thank you madam chair Sheriff I
 
04:00:11.550 --> 04:00:11.560 align:start position:0%
know you just stated that you are now
 
04:00:13.510 --> 04:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
putting $80,000 into your expenditure
 
04:00:15.229 --> 04:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
line I
 
04:00:16.550 --> 04:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
if I'm not mistaken you're going to have
 
04:00:19.670 --> 04:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
$80,000 also on your Revenue line item
 
04:00:21.590 --> 04:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
because you're going to be collecting
 
04:00:24.110 --> 04:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
back for that line item as well is that
 
04:00:26.269 --> 04:00:26.279 align:start position:0%
not correct yes sir and I would love
 
04:00:28.110 --> 04:00:28.120 align:start position:0%
those discussions to be had in parallel
 
04:00:29.349 --> 04:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
but they never want to talk about
 
04:00:30.750 --> 04:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
revenues at the same time they talk
 
04:00:34.750 --> 04:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
about expenses thank you thank you does
 
04:00:37.149 --> 04:00:37.159 align:start position:0%

04:00:40.229 --> 04:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
question seeing none thank you thank you

okay so I do not have any additional
 
04:00:51.189 --> 04:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
pink cards is there anybody present in
 
04:00:52.870 --> 04:00:52.880 align:start position:0%

04:00:54.830 --> 04:00:54.840 align:start position:0%

04:02:39.189 --> 04:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
78 uh which is really a simple addition
 
04:02:41.070 --> 04:02:41.080 align:start position:0%
uh to correct an oversight in a bill
 
04:02:43.389 --> 04:02:43.399 align:start position:0%
from last term and for those who of you
 
04:02:44.870 --> 04:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
who are not not here I'm going to just
 
04:02:46.510 --> 04:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
give you a brief history of what that
 
04:02:48.950 --> 04:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
bill did so it kind of gives you an idea
 
04:02:50.630 --> 04:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
of where we are and what we're doing
 
04:02:55.269 --> 04:02:55.279 align:start position:0%
here so up until last term um in the
 
04:02:57.590 --> 04:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire nine out of the
 
04:02:59.510 --> 04:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
10 counties elected
 
04:03:02.630 --> 04:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
their um Commissioners by district
 
04:03:04.590 --> 04:03:04.600 align:start position:0%
straford county was the only one that
 
04:03:07.870 --> 04:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
elected them at large in other words the
 
04:03:09.630 --> 04:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
entire County elected all three
 
04:03:12.429 --> 04:03:12.439 align:start position:0%
Commissioners well we put in a bill last
 
04:03:15.389 --> 04:03:15.399 align:start position:0%
term uh that actually districted uh
 
04:03:17.149 --> 04:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
straford County for the first time and
 
04:03:18.670 --> 04:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
that went
 
04:03:18.680 --> 04:03:21.149 align:start position:0%
that went
through

04:03:21.149 --> 04:03:21.159 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:03:25.510 --> 04:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
um when it came time for the election
 
04:03:28.590 --> 04:03:28.600 align:start position:0%
filings we had two individuals file for
 
04:03:30.750 --> 04:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
one of the districts District
 
04:03:34.149 --> 04:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
3 and what happened with that is one of
 
04:03:37.189 --> 04:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
the individuals actually lived outside
 
04:03:40.630 --> 04:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
the district now again the whole intent
 
04:03:43.070 --> 04:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
of the bill that we had put in was to
 
04:03:45.469 --> 04:03:45.479 align:start position:0%
have the individual Commissioners
 
04:03:47.149 --> 04:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
representing their
 
04:03:51.550 --> 04:03:51.560 align:start position:0%
District so when um the other individual
 
04:03:53.750 --> 04:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
in that District
 
04:03:57.630 --> 04:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
3 actually filed an election uh a
 
04:04:00.590 --> 04:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
complaint with the election law
 
04:04:04.990 --> 04:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
committee we went to that and the issue
 
04:04:08.269 --> 04:04:08.279 align:start position:0%
um again was ended up coming over you'll
 
04:04:10.429 --> 04:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
see in the in the bill in front of you
 
04:04:10.439 --> 04:04:12.550 align:start position:0%
see in the in the bill in front of you
RSA

04:04:12.550 --> 04:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
04:04:15.389 --> 04:04:15.399 align:start position:0%
6559 and and although the commissioner
 
04:04:17.189 --> 04:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
the ballot lock
 
04:04:19.830 --> 04:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
commission individuals actually agreed
 
04:04:22.750 --> 04:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
with us they they didn't approve it
 
04:04:24.229 --> 04:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
because they said they didn't believe it
 
04:04:26.229 --> 04:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
was in their
 
04:04:31.510 --> 04:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so what we are doing here
 
04:04:31.520 --> 04:04:34.269 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so what we are doing here
is

04:04:34.269 --> 04:04:34.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:04:38.389 --> 04:04:38.399 align:start position:0%
putting let's back up a little bit um
 
04:04:40.510 --> 04:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
when we did I think I said at the very
 
04:04:43.469 --> 04:04:43.479 align:start position:0%
beginning Here We There Was An oversight
 
04:04:43.479 --> 04:04:44.550 align:start position:0%
beginning Here We There Was An oversight
um

04:04:44.550 --> 04:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:47.670 --> 04:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
and 6559 was in a different section of
 
04:04:50.790 --> 04:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
the rsas than the the area where we
 
04:04:53.790 --> 04:04:53.800 align:start position:0%
actually districted straford
 
04:04:58.149 --> 04:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
County so that one uh you'll see in the
 
04:05:01.229 --> 04:05:01.239 align:start position:0%
the bill that I put forward uh basically
 
04:05:03.550 --> 04:05:03.560 align:start position:0%
in section one it just adds And straford
 
04:05:06.309 --> 04:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
to clarify that that all yeah also in
 
04:05:09.389 --> 04:05:09.399 align:start position:0%
straford county that you have to be a a
 
04:05:11.750 --> 04:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
resident of that you must be domiciled
 
04:05:16.110 --> 04:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:18.309 --> 04:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
um and that was the issue we went before
 
04:05:20.429 --> 04:05:20.439 align:start position:0%
the ballot law commission they said yeah
 
04:05:22.550 --> 04:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
we we agree with you but we don't
 
04:05:23.990 --> 04:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
believe we have the authority to change
 
04:05:26.389 --> 04:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
it so we're here to do that um there
 
04:05:27.830 --> 04:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
were different ways we could have
 
04:05:30.149 --> 04:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
skinned the cat to get this
 
04:05:32.349 --> 04:05:32.359 align:start position:0%
accomplished uh but I think the easiest
 
04:05:35.070 --> 04:05:35.080 align:start position:0%
way was just to add straford into the
 
04:05:38.469 --> 04:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
list of the other nine uh counties there
 
04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
so that's what you see the second part
 
04:05:43.830 --> 04:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
of that uh starting on line eight you'll
 
04:05:46.030 --> 04:05:46.040 align:start position:0%
see where it says application straford
 
04:05:48.469 --> 04:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
County that's a lot of language that
 
04:05:52.349 --> 04:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
basically says what is
 
04:05:54.870 --> 04:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
currently um the individual that was
 
04:05:58.349 --> 04:05:58.359 align:start position:0%
currently elected will re continue to be
 
04:05:59.990 --> 04:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh that commissioner even though he
 
04:06:02.309 --> 04:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
lives out of the district which by the
 
04:06:04.550 --> 04:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
way I believe it's the only I don't know
 
04:06:05.950 --> 04:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
if it's the first time but it's the only
 
04:06:09.229 --> 04:06:09.239 align:start position:0%
individual who actually represent a dis
 
04:06:10.710 --> 04:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
represents a district that he doesn't
 
04:06:11.830 --> 04:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
live in I don't think that's ever
 
04:06:13.830 --> 04:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
happened before which is why we need to
 
04:06:16.710 --> 04:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
correct it um
 
04:06:19.950 --> 04:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
but that uh that second section starting
 
04:06:21.990 --> 04:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
on Eight Is is what that do a lot of
 
04:06:24.870 --> 04:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
wording that basically says what is is
 
04:06:27.269 --> 04:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
and this will not change until the
 
04:06:30.590 --> 04:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
election uh the next general election in
 
04:06:33.750 --> 04:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
2026 now I understand Senator gray will
 
04:06:35.950 --> 04:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
present you with an amendment to this
 
04:06:37.550 --> 04:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
I've read through it and I would highly
 
04:06:40.309 --> 04:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
recommend you do adopt it um it it
 
04:06:43.229 --> 04:06:43.239 align:start position:0%
clarifies the section A little bit more
 
04:06:43.239 --> 04:06:45.510 align:start position:0%
clarifies the section A little bit more
um

04:06:45.510 --> 04:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:48.830 --> 04:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
better um than currently exists so I
 
04:06:50.870 --> 04:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
would recommend when he passes that out
 
04:06:54.229 --> 04:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
to you um that you consider it U before
 
04:06:58.030 --> 04:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
it gets over to his Committee in the
 
04:07:02.110 --> 04:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
Senate I believe that's all I
 
04:07:06.630 --> 04:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
have my brain is still somewhere over
 
04:07:09.070 --> 04:07:09.080 align:start position:0%
Europe and my body's here but my brain's
 
04:07:11.030 --> 04:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
over Europe so I hopefully I did
 
04:07:12.510 --> 04:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
everything you needed or said everything
 
04:07:14.389 --> 04:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
you needed to hear certainly take any
 
04:07:16.750 --> 04:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative turot
 
04:07:18.630 --> 04:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
for that introduction I have a quick
 
04:07:21.710 --> 04:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
question sure could you refresh our my
 
04:07:23.830 --> 04:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
memory and those who were here
 
04:07:26.109 --> 04:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
previously what is the bill number in
 
04:07:28.950 --> 04:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
the year that you're you're referring to
 
04:07:30.309 --> 04:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
the old one you mean correct yeah I
 
04:07:31.750 --> 04:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
don't have that in front of me it was
 
04:07:34.990 --> 04:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
last it was 2024
 
04:07:38.950 --> 04:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
though what was it 70 M 75 thank you so
 
04:07:41.229 --> 04:07:41.239 align:start position:0%
it the the original one though that was
 
04:07:44.070 --> 04:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
filed I don't it was an hp75 because if
 
04:07:45.670 --> 04:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
you all remember it got stuck in
 
04:07:49.830 --> 04:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
committee because it was uh
 
04:07:54.389 --> 04:07:54.399 align:start position:0%
retained uh but it ended up being on
 
04:07:57.510 --> 04:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
hp75 questions for the prime sponsor the
 
04:08:00.030 --> 04:08:00.040 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative
 
04:08:02.149 --> 04:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair and thank
 
04:08:04.830 --> 04:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um a couple
 
04:08:07.469 --> 04:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
times in your testimony you referenced
 
04:08:10.710 --> 04:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
um District to be domiciled in the
 
04:08:12.670 --> 04:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
district but in the bill it says in the
 
04:08:12.680 --> 04:08:16.149 align:start position:0%
district but in the bill it says in the
county

04:08:16.149 --> 04:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:27.070 --> 04:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:30.870 --> 04:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
um looks like line three so I I see what
 
04:08:32.309 --> 04:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
you're saying so in the first part of
 
04:08:34.349 --> 04:08:34.359 align:start position:0%
that you you'll see starting on line two
 
04:08:36.109 --> 04:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
going through line four it talks to
 
04:08:38.510 --> 04:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioners sheriffs County attorneys
 
04:08:40.910 --> 04:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh County treasures reg talks to a whole
 
04:08:42.710 --> 04:08:42.720 align:start position:0%
slew of people and it says that they
 
04:08:44.229 --> 04:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
they must be
 
04:08:46.790 --> 04:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh must have a domicile in the county he
 
04:08:49.950 --> 04:08:49.960 align:start position:0%
was chosen then it goes on to talk about
 
04:08:52.269 --> 04:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
County Commissioner where it's more
 
04:08:54.469 --> 04:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
specific where it says person must have
 
04:08:57.070 --> 04:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
a domicile in the district so the first
 
04:08:58.790 --> 04:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
part of it is more all-encompassing for
 
04:09:00.229 --> 04:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
the county the second part is just for
 
04:09:00.239 --> 04:09:01.950 align:start position:0%
the county the second part is just for
the

04:09:01.950 --> 04:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:09:08.550 --> 04:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:13.870 --> 04:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
questions okay I have a question sure so
 
04:09:18.269 --> 04:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:22.269 --> 04:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
see it pertains to vacancies so that
 
04:09:24.309 --> 04:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
that would be in the the section two
 
04:09:29.830 --> 04:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
applicab application MH if um lines 11
 
04:09:32.189 --> 04:09:32.199 align:start position:0%
12 and on it says if there shall be a
 
04:09:34.510 --> 04:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
vacancy in a commissioner district for
 
04:09:37.750 --> 04:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
any reason prior to the 2026 state
 
04:09:40.389 --> 04:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
general election the vacancy shall be
 
04:09:43.389 --> 04:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
filled as provided in law for straford
 
04:09:46.550 --> 04:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners that existed for
 
04:09:50.630 --> 04:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
the 2024 state general election so that
 
04:09:52.590 --> 04:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
that vacancy shall be filled by the
 
04:09:52.600 --> 04:09:53.630 align:start position:0%
that vacancy shall be filled by the
county

04:09:53.630 --> 04:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
county
 
04:09:56.229 --> 04:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
delegation no um it would be filled in
 
04:09:58.790 --> 04:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
the same way as in other words what
 
04:10:01.710 --> 04:10:01.720 align:start position:0%
that's that line is saying is because
 
04:10:06.590 --> 04:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
right now we um in straford County
 
04:10:07.910 --> 04:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
somebody can
 
04:10:11.309 --> 04:10:11.319 align:start position:0%
live in the domicile outside the
 
04:10:14.229 --> 04:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
district which he's running for for that
 
04:10:17.550 --> 04:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
that would continue should a vacancy
 
04:10:19.389 --> 04:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
occur that's that's what that line
 
04:10:22.070 --> 04:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
refers to I understand that what I'm
 
04:10:27.870 --> 04:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
trying to get at is who fills a
 
04:10:30.469 --> 04:10:30.479 align:start position:0%
vacancy I would I would say that would
 
04:10:33.229 --> 04:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
be probably an election yeah I I don't
 
04:10:34.590 --> 04:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
know but I would say it was probably an
 
04:10:39.830 --> 04:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
election no excuse me um yeah
 
04:10:42.070 --> 04:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
only individuals that the chair
 
04:10:44.389 --> 04:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
recognizes shall speak what I'm getting
 
04:10:49.389 --> 04:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
at is it is my understanding that the
 
04:10:51.389 --> 04:10:51.399 align:start position:0%
the body that would fill that vacancy
 
04:10:54.469 --> 04:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
would be the county delegation as a
 
04:10:57.910 --> 04:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
whole so my question is is that what you
 
04:11:00.670 --> 04:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
really want or because now you have
 
04:11:03.510 --> 04:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
three Commissioners that are in three
 
04:11:03.520 --> 04:11:04.590 align:start position:0%
three Commissioners that are in three
different

04:11:04.590 --> 04:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:11:08.309 --> 04:11:08.319 align:start position:0%
districts would it not be perhaps um a
 
04:11:11.670 --> 04:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
better idea to have those delegates from
 
04:11:13.750 --> 04:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
that District
 
04:11:17.550 --> 04:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
elect the replacement and not the entire
 
04:11:17.560 --> 04:11:18.910 align:start position:0%
elect the replacement and not the entire
County

04:11:18.910 --> 04:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
County
 
04:11:23.590 --> 04:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
delegation no um and I think uh rep uh
 
04:11:26.630 --> 04:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
Senator Gray's Amendment will actually
 
04:11:31.870 --> 04:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
speak to this perfect thank you further
 
04:11:34.750 --> 04:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I appreciate you
 
04:11:43.750 --> 04:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:07.070 --> 04:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:09.590 --> 04:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you madam chair my name is
 
04:12:12.469 --> 04:12:12.479 align:start position:0%
James Gray I'm a senator from District
 
04:12:16.269 --> 04:12:16.279 align:start position:0%
Six uh representing Alton gilmon all the
 
04:12:19.109 --> 04:12:19.119 align:start position:0%
way down Route 11 to Rochester and
 
04:12:22.229 --> 04:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
Strafford uh just one correction the
 
04:12:24.550 --> 04:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
what you've got in front of you is not
 
04:12:26.550 --> 04:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
an amendment for your committee it is
 
04:12:29.950 --> 04:12:29.960 align:start position:0%
what I will submit in my committee if
 
04:12:32.670 --> 04:12:32.680 align:start position:0%
you pass that bill to correct some of
 
04:12:34.670 --> 04:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
the things that are in there should you
 
04:12:37.189 --> 04:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
choose to adopt some of those things
 
04:12:39.229 --> 04:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
before it comes to me I would be more
 
04:12:41.870 --> 04:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
than happy for you to do
 
04:12:46.109 --> 04:12:46.119 align:start position:0%
that the two things
 
04:12:50.710 --> 04:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
um the existing law says that you must
 
04:12:52.710 --> 04:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
maintain a
 
04:12:57.950 --> 04:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
domicile well RSA 6541 is the statute
 
04:13:00.630 --> 04:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
that talks about domicile and you can
 
04:13:04.910 --> 04:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
only have one doile for voting purposes
 
04:13:08.670 --> 04:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
so changing this in both the the lines
 
04:13:12.389 --> 04:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
that I have got here line five and line
 
04:13:15.990 --> 04:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
8 I believe believe it is uh to maintain
 
04:13:19.469 --> 04:13:19.479 align:start position:0%
your domicile or their domicile when the
 
04:13:22.510 --> 04:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
actual words in the bill uh is important
 
04:13:25.550 --> 04:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
to me because I don't want anybody to
 
04:13:28.070 --> 04:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
can be confused that well I could have a
 
04:13:30.030 --> 04:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
house over here and I could have a house
 
04:13:32.070 --> 04:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
over here and as long as one of those
 
04:13:34.950 --> 04:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
houses that I'm going to call a
 
04:13:37.710 --> 04:13:37.720 align:start position:0%
domicile you know will get me in that's
 
04:13:40.349 --> 04:13:40.359 align:start position:0%
not the case all right and if you want
 
04:13:44.750 --> 04:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
to go back and look at RSA 654 one um
 
04:13:47.030 --> 04:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
you'll see that it's you can only have
 
04:13:49.070 --> 04:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
one doile for voting
 
04:13:51.870 --> 04:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
purposes uh so I do that in both uh
 
04:13:54.870 --> 04:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
places where we talk about the domicile
 
04:13:57.590 --> 04:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
that and I add it in there and maintain
 
04:13:57.600 --> 04:13:58.389 align:start position:0%
that and I add it in there and maintain
that

04:13:58.389 --> 04:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:01.590 --> 04:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
domicile okay so that you know if a
 
04:14:03.830 --> 04:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner you know was elected and
 
04:14:08.950 --> 04:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
then moved from in our case say from do
 
04:14:08.960 --> 04:14:09.950 align:start position:0%
then moved from in our case say from do
to

04:14:09.950 --> 04:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:14:12.670 --> 04:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
Farmington okay uh they would no longer
 
04:14:15.229 --> 04:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
be in in the district and again that
 
04:14:17.349 --> 04:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
would be against what we're talking
 
04:14:21.229 --> 04:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
about here the bottom portion uh talks
 
04:14:23.269 --> 04:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
about what would happen if there's a
 
04:14:26.269 --> 04:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
vacancy okay and certainly it was our
 
04:14:29.309 --> 04:14:29.319 align:start position:0%
intent uh that uh this be in effect for
 
04:14:31.750 --> 04:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
the 2024 elections that you had to live
 
04:14:34.790 --> 04:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
in the district uh there was only one
 
04:14:38.590 --> 04:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
person who testified at the uh
 
04:14:41.830 --> 04:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
commission meeting uh the election law
 
04:14:44.469 --> 04:14:44.479 align:start position:0%
uh committee uh that said that they knew
 
04:14:47.349 --> 04:14:47.359 align:start position:0%
that this uh wasn't changed and that
 
04:14:49.870 --> 04:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
representative lives in Durham uh I
 
04:14:51.790 --> 04:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
think you can go look up the testimony
 
04:14:55.309 --> 04:14:55.319 align:start position:0%
if you want uh and did not tell anybody
 
04:14:58.349 --> 04:14:58.359 align:start position:0%
uh at least didn't tell anybody on my
 
04:15:01.070 --> 04:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
side of the uh Defence uh that we
 
04:15:04.510 --> 04:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
neglected to do that uh so we are trying
 
04:15:07.389 --> 04:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
to make that correction but if for any
 
04:15:10.670 --> 04:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
reason a vacancy does
 
04:15:13.790 --> 04:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
exist then we want that person to have
 
04:15:16.389 --> 04:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
their domicile in the
 
04:15:19.510 --> 04:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
district okay we are not trying to throw
 
04:15:22.389 --> 04:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
anybody out of office if you're elected
 
04:15:25.229 --> 04:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
and you stay elected uh and there's only
 
04:15:27.550 --> 04:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
one commissioner right now in straford
 
04:15:30.469 --> 04:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
County who does not live in his district
 
04:15:34.189 --> 04:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
uh but we'll say uh uh commissioner
 
04:15:37.550 --> 04:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
Petri one of your former colleagues uh
 
04:15:40.870 --> 04:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
for some reason uh was no longer able to
 
04:15:44.469 --> 04:15:44.479 align:start position:0%
serve okay he lives in that District but
 
04:15:48.149 --> 04:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
if he is replaced certainly we want him
 
04:15:50.229 --> 04:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
to be replaced with someone who does
 
04:15:52.670 --> 04:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
live in that district and the chair is
 
04:15:56.149 --> 04:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
correct that the county uh Commissioners
 
04:15:58.990 --> 04:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
and the delegations are the ones that uh
 
04:16:02.149 --> 04:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
would do that um I think it's kind of a
 
04:16:05.550 --> 04:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
moot point whether or not um you have
 
04:16:08.349 --> 04:16:08.359 align:start position:0%
just the delegation members from that
 
04:16:10.790 --> 04:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
District you know should you decide to
 
04:16:13.910 --> 04:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
change that so that it was that
 
04:16:18.830 --> 04:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not hard over in either case um
 
04:16:21.469 --> 04:16:21.479 align:start position:0%
but you know I'll leave that to you and
 
04:16:24.429 --> 04:16:24.439 align:start position:0%
to the prime sponsor of the bill to
 
04:16:28.870 --> 04:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
resolve um I I personally don't have any
 
04:16:28.880 --> 04:16:29.790 align:start position:0%
resolve um I I personally don't have any
any

04:16:29.790 --> 04:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:16:34.229 --> 04:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
reason um to get very upset I know that
 
04:16:37.630 --> 04:16:37.640 align:start position:0%
in straford County uh right now because
 
04:16:40.229 --> 04:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
of the way the delegation is uh there
 
04:16:42.309 --> 04:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
will be more democratic votes if
 
04:16:45.630 --> 04:16:45.640 align:start position:0%
everyone does it and Republican votes uh
 
04:16:49.070 --> 04:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
because that's what the citizens chose
 
04:16:52.030 --> 04:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
uh it does it would not meet the spirit
 
04:16:54.429 --> 04:16:54.439 align:start position:0%
of what we were trying to do in having
 
04:16:58.149 --> 04:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
the people of the district uh elect that
 
04:17:02.030 --> 04:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
person um but that may also require you
 
04:17:05.469 --> 04:17:05.479 align:start position:0%
to go out and change other statutes that
 
04:17:09.429 --> 04:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
we did change in the previous bill so
 
04:17:12.990 --> 04:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
I'd caution you to to have OS look at
 
04:17:16.510 --> 04:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
that very carefully uh to make sure that
 
04:17:18.870 --> 04:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh we're not violating something else
 
04:17:22.389 --> 04:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
that we did um if you have any questions
 
04:17:25.149 --> 04:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
I'd be more than happy to I'm trying to
 
04:17:27.510 --> 04:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
get back down to house Ways and Means
 
04:17:27.520 --> 04:17:30.389 align:start position:0%

so do any members have a question for
 
04:17:33.960 --> 04:17:35.030 align:start position:0%
so do any members have a question for
Senator

04:17:35.030 --> 04:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
Senator

voting purposes being a citizen of the

United States etc etc etc and since we
 
04:18:09.790 --> 04:18:09.800 align:start position:0%
are talking uh that it would be the
 
04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
definition that would be
 
04:18:15.630 --> 04:18:15.640 align:start position:0%

bill before it goes into the Senate it
 
04:18:37.030 --> 04:18:37.040 align:start position:0%

presented to you uh and I did give
 
04:18:43.070 --> 04:18:43.080 align:start position:0%

go to Greece or somewhere else it was
 
04:18:49.790 --> 04:18:49.800 align:start position:0%

I represent straford District 19 which
 
04:20:31.950 --> 04:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
is Rochester WS 1 two 3 four and six um
 
04:20:34.229 --> 04:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
I'm just support here in support of this
 
04:20:37.109 --> 04:20:37.119 align:start position:0%
bill uh I kind of followed this process
 
04:20:40.070 --> 04:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
along um when the bill first came out I
 
04:20:44.109 --> 04:20:44.119 align:start position:0%
believe in 2023 and in 2024 when it all
 
04:20:46.389 --> 04:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
moved around and all the way up to when
 
04:20:48.149 --> 04:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
it was at the Battle law
 
04:20:51.309 --> 04:20:51.319 align:start position:0%
commission uh unfortunately this was uh
 
04:20:54.070 --> 04:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
an oversight it was a technicality as we
 
04:20:56.790 --> 04:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
all know uh for people that have uh been
 
04:20:59.030 --> 04:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
in the house and and for people that are
 
04:21:01.830 --> 04:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
new um we have a lot of rsas there are a
 
04:21:03.830 --> 04:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
lot so there a lot of paper that's
 
04:21:07.910 --> 04:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
pushed around OS and when um you know a
 
04:21:10.149 --> 04:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
bill is actually you know getting
 
04:21:12.389 --> 04:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
enrolled and everything that's happening
 
04:21:12.399 --> 04:21:14.189 align:start position:0%
enrolled and everything that's happening
um

04:21:14.189 --> 04:21:14.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:15.790 --> 04:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
it wasn't looked at in all the places
 
04:21:18.550 --> 04:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
where it applied to so as you can
 
04:21:21.429 --> 04:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
imagine for every single state position
 
04:21:24.429 --> 04:21:24.439 align:start position:0%
in um in New Hampshire so that's from
 
04:21:26.510 --> 04:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners to sheriffs to
 
04:21:28.229 --> 04:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
where there's districts to every single
 
04:21:31.349 --> 04:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
State Rep that is here um you are
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
running in in in your district and uh so
 
04:21:37.910 --> 04:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
except for uh straford County
 
04:21:41.309 --> 04:21:41.319 align:start position:0%
Commissioners right now so it was um it
 
04:21:43.670 --> 04:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
was something that was not put into the
 
04:21:47.790 --> 04:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
law uh in a sense a loophole that um
 
04:21:49.189 --> 04:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
could have been corrected but there
 
04:21:50.630 --> 04:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
probably would have had to
 
04:21:53.750 --> 04:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
been um maybe lawyers involved and
 
04:21:55.469 --> 04:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
things like that and it just wasn't
 
04:21:58.109 --> 04:21:58.119 align:start position:0%
necessary at that point so um this is
 
04:22:00.189 --> 04:22:00.199 align:start position:0%
fixing it I'm really glad that Senator
 
04:22:01.950 --> 04:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
gray put that Amendment forward so I'm
 
04:22:03.630 --> 04:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
hoping that you guys if you wanted to
 
04:22:05.990 --> 04:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
maybe save him some time um you could
 
04:22:09.950 --> 04:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
push that through um just to so you
 
04:22:11.510 --> 04:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
understand how it affected it there's
 
04:22:15.349 --> 04:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
three districts in raford County um and
 
04:22:19.030 --> 04:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
it was affected in specifically in
 
04:22:22.710 --> 04:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
District um uh where is it District
 
04:22:26.590 --> 04:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
three thank you um so we actually had uh
 
04:22:29.630 --> 04:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
one representative that um filed that
 
04:22:31.590 --> 04:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
was in the district he was in Rochester
 
04:22:34.510 --> 04:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
War II the gentleman that filed against
 
04:22:38.389 --> 04:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
him uh with the same party um was in out
 
04:22:41.189 --> 04:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
of District in do um he should have
 
04:22:44.229 --> 04:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
actually been filing in District 2 and
 
04:22:46.990 --> 04:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
then the opposing party on the Democrat
 
04:22:49.750 --> 04:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
side was actually um out of District as
 
04:22:52.349 --> 04:22:52.359 align:start position:0%
well so that's what you know that's kind
 
04:22:54.189 --> 04:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
of what happened and currently we do
 
04:22:56.269 --> 04:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
have a sitting commissioner that doesn't
 
04:23:00.710 --> 04:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
represent District um District 3 so
 
04:23:02.189 --> 04:23:02.199 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where we're at we'd like
 
04:23:04.750 --> 04:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
to correct this um I do have a question
 
04:23:06.349 --> 04:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
and I will follow up with the committee
 
04:23:08.950 --> 04:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
because um it was brought up based upon
 
04:23:10.750 --> 04:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
what I know right now on the books
 
04:23:13.429 --> 04:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
there's a conflicting RSA
 
04:23:16.349 --> 04:23:16.359 align:start position:0%
so for example let's say if that
 
04:23:19.990 --> 04:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner um you know fail resigned
 
04:23:23.189 --> 04:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
or um whatever happened or was you know
 
04:23:26.269 --> 04:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
trying to be removed um I'm pretty sure
 
04:23:28.990 --> 04:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
that there's an RSA that says um in
 
04:23:31.030 --> 04:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
regards with the delegation appointing a
 
04:23:33.389 --> 04:23:33.399 align:start position:0%
new commissioner that they would have to
 
04:23:35.510 --> 04:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
reside in the district I know at the
 
04:23:37.510 --> 04:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
ballot law commission that's how we
 
04:23:40.269 --> 04:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
argued to try to get this changed in
 
04:23:42.870 --> 04:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
regards with the filing period stuff so
 
04:23:44.670 --> 04:23:44.680 align:start position:0%
I will follow up with that because I
 
04:23:47.870 --> 04:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
think it's important um you know I'm not
 
04:23:49.910 --> 04:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
sure if that gentleman I hopefully he'll
 
04:23:51.870 --> 04:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
carry out his whole term and we won't
 
04:23:55.109 --> 04:23:55.119 align:start position:0%
have to worry about it but if he doesn't
 
04:23:57.990 --> 04:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
um there is an RSA that actually says
 
04:23:59.750 --> 04:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
for the delegation that they would have
 
04:24:03.189 --> 04:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
to be um in District so I think that's
 
04:24:04.710 --> 04:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
all I have to say if you have any
 
04:24:07.269 --> 04:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
questions let me know but um I'm just
 
04:24:09.510 --> 04:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
supporting this um fixing a loophole
 
04:24:11.790 --> 04:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately but thank you
 
04:24:11.800 --> 04:24:12.990 align:start position:0%
unfortunately but thank you
representative

04:24:12.990 --> 04:24:13.000 align:start position:0%

04:24:35.710 --> 04:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:38.149 --> 04:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
government thank you uh for the record
 
04:24:40.710 --> 04:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
I'm Alvin C I represent marac County
 
04:24:43.030 --> 04:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
District 26 which is a float bual with 8
 
04:24:45.510 --> 04:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
towns if you really want all the names
 
04:24:51.670 --> 04:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
I'll give them to you um for this bill
 
04:24:53.790 --> 04:24:53.800 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that I was
 
04:24:56.189 --> 04:24:56.199 align:start position:0%
concerned about which uh Senator gray
 
04:24:59.269 --> 04:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
addressed in his proposed amendment was
 
04:25:01.710 --> 04:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:25:05.630 --> 04:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
um um elected commissioner to maintain
 
04:25:07.790 --> 04:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
domicile in the
 
04:25:12.109 --> 04:25:12.119 align:start position:0%
district um so as for for the term is
 
04:25:12.119 --> 04:25:12.990 align:start position:0%
district um so as for for the term is
off

04:25:12.990 --> 04:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
off
 
04:25:16.870 --> 04:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
office um the other couple of thoughts I
 
04:25:21.429 --> 04:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
had was um online uh
 
04:25:24.189 --> 04:25:24.199 align:start position:0%
13 where it says the vacancies shall be
 
04:25:28.229 --> 04:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
provided for law uh based on the
 
04:25:33.309 --> 04:25:33.319 align:start position:0%
2024 uh laws uh I would suggest that
 
04:25:36.389 --> 04:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
this be provided uh if there's a vacancy
 
04:25:38.429 --> 04:25:38.439 align:start position:0%
that it would be this paragraph would be
 
04:25:42.630 --> 04:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
the defining thing so that um any
 
04:25:44.990 --> 04:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
vacancies is filled is filled with a
 
04:25:46.710 --> 04:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
person within that
 
04:25:50.630 --> 04:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
district and for Stafford
 
04:25:50.640 --> 04:25:52.149 align:start position:0%
district and for Stafford
County

04:25:52.149 --> 04:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
County
 
04:25:56.269 --> 04:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
uh you may want to consider staggering
 
04:25:59.269 --> 04:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
the Implement implementation of this for
 
04:26:02.349 --> 04:26:02.359 align:start position:0%
the three districts over uh different
 
04:26:04.870 --> 04:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
election terms
 
04:26:07.990 --> 04:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
um possibly just to help alleviate the
 
04:26:10.030 --> 04:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
situation where you've got one person on
 
04:26:11.630 --> 04:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
in the district you might want to give
 
04:26:12.750 --> 04:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
them the
 
04:26:15.590 --> 04:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
benefit of the doubt that's up to you
 
04:26:16.990 --> 04:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
it's just a
 
04:26:19.590 --> 04:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
suggestion uh I'll take questions if
 
04:26:20.830 --> 04:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
anyone has
 
04:26:23.550 --> 04:26:23.560 align:start position:0%

that hello thank you for allowing me to
 
04:26:52.469 --> 04:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
speak today my name is Susan Rice I
 
04:26:55.510 --> 04:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
reside at 1591 Rod Road in Rochester New
 
04:26:58.429 --> 04:26:58.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I have followed this bill all
 
04:27:00.710 --> 04:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
the way through I have also testified at
 
04:27:03.510 --> 04:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
the ballot law commission the idea was
 
04:27:05.750 --> 04:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
to bring straford County into
 
04:27:08.189 --> 04:27:08.199 align:start position:0%
conformance with the other nine counties
 
04:27:10.950 --> 04:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
within the state of New Hampshire I hope
 
04:27:12.149 --> 04:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
that you will seriously consider
 
04:27:13.910 --> 04:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
consider adopting this along with
 
04:27:16.910 --> 04:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Gray's Amendment though I will
 
04:27:18.590 --> 04:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
confess I have not um had the
 
04:27:21.670 --> 04:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to read his amendment in its
 
04:27:24.550 --> 04:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
entirety um but from what he explained I
 
04:27:26.550 --> 04:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
think that he addressed several of the
 
04:27:29.429 --> 04:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
issues in regards to the last speaker
 
04:27:32.950 --> 04:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
having staggered terms we only have this
 
04:27:37.670 --> 04:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
issue in District Two And if this is all
 
04:27:40.950 --> 04:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
passed it's my understanding that it
 
04:27:43.030 --> 04:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
will be corrected in the
 
04:27:46.349 --> 04:27:46.359 align:start position:0%
2026 election and then we will be in
 
04:27:46.359 --> 04:27:47.349 align:start position:0%
2026 election and then we will be in
full

04:27:47.349 --> 04:27:47.359 align:start position:0%
full
 
04:27:49.710 --> 04:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
conformance with what the spirit and
 
04:27:52.510 --> 04:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
intent and those words spirit and intent
 
04:27:56.030 --> 04:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
were repeatedly stated by those of us
 
04:27:57.910 --> 04:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
who testified at the ballot lock
 
04:27:59.710 --> 04:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
commission thank
 
04:28:02.870 --> 04:28:02.880 align:start position:0%

Rep from 20110 to
 
04:28:40.870 --> 04:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
2020 uh I am neutral on the bill itself
 
04:28:43.790 --> 04:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
um however I just wanted to point out
 
04:28:46.710 --> 04:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
some language as we all know words have
 
04:28:49.229 --> 04:28:49.239 align:start position:0%
meaning um and I've been trying to work
 
04:28:51.070 --> 04:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
on this over the last four years on
 
04:28:54.469 --> 04:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
fixing it um I did hear Senator gray add
 
04:28:56.229 --> 04:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
an amendment with the word maintain in
 
04:28:59.750 --> 04:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
there but I would ask that the committee
 
04:29:02.429 --> 04:29:02.439 align:start position:0%
kind of really do a deep dive into it
 
04:29:04.710 --> 04:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
and I'll Point your attention to lines
 
04:29:05.990 --> 04:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
six and
 
04:29:08.189 --> 04:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
seven and it just basically says a
 
04:29:09.790 --> 04:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
person must have a domicile in the
 
04:29:11.830 --> 04:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
district from which he is elected at the
 
04:29:14.830 --> 04:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
time time of his election at the time of
 
04:29:16.429 --> 04:29:16.439 align:start position:0%
his election obviously you're going to
 
04:29:18.910 --> 04:29:18.920 align:start position:0%
change the pronouns but I just want to
 
04:29:20.109 --> 04:29:20.119 align:start position:0%
share with you what happened in
 
04:29:22.030 --> 04:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County four years ago before
 
04:29:24.670 --> 04:29:24.680 align:start position:0%
I became a commissioner the commissioner
 
04:29:27.710 --> 04:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
who had my seat was in a district
 
04:29:27.720 --> 04:29:28.830 align:start position:0%
who had my seat was in a district
district

04:29:28.830 --> 04:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
district
 
04:29:33.830 --> 04:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
three he ended up um getting married to
 
04:29:36.429 --> 04:29:36.439 align:start position:0%
a female that uh lives in lived in
 
04:29:37.990 --> 04:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth a whole different
 
04:29:40.710 --> 04:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
District so he ended up
 
04:29:44.109 --> 04:29:44.119 align:start position:0%
moving from Derry to pouth opposite
 
04:29:45.910 --> 04:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
sides of of the
 
04:29:49.070 --> 04:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
county and when approached we asked him
 
04:29:51.070 --> 04:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
to resign because he no longer
 
04:29:54.109 --> 04:29:54.119 align:start position:0%
represented the people of that District
 
04:29:56.670 --> 04:29:56.680 align:start position:0%
he being a lawyer himself actually
 
04:29:58.670 --> 04:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
obtained a lawyer and his lawyer said
 
04:30:01.269 --> 04:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
that those little words at the time of
 
04:30:01.279 --> 04:30:02.630 align:start position:0%
that those little words at the time of
his

04:30:02.630 --> 04:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
his
 
04:30:06.309 --> 04:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
election meant that he got to stay so
 
04:30:08.149 --> 04:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
here's a county commissioner who lives
 
04:30:09.910 --> 04:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth who used to represent
 
04:30:12.349 --> 04:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
District 3
 
04:30:14.269 --> 04:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
what we found out was is they were
 
04:30:17.429 --> 04:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
trying to buy real estate in the in his
 
04:30:20.950 --> 04:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
old district for transitional
 
04:30:23.590 --> 04:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
housing and what happened was the
 
04:30:25.349 --> 04:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
delegation found out I was a member of
 
04:30:28.149 --> 04:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
the delegation at the time found out
 
04:30:29.189 --> 04:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
that they were trying to buy this
 
04:30:31.590 --> 04:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
transitional housing which was between
 
04:30:33.630 --> 04:30:33.640 align:start position:0%
two elementary schools and the
 
04:30:35.550 --> 04:30:35.560 align:start position:0%
transitional housing was for uh
 
04:30:37.109 --> 04:30:37.119 align:start position:0%
releasing prisoners I have nothing
 
04:30:38.710 --> 04:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
against transitional housing for
 
04:30:42.030 --> 04:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
prisoners but location means everything
 
04:30:44.109 --> 04:30:44.119 align:start position:0%
my point being is is how does a county
 
04:30:46.510 --> 04:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner who moves out of his
 
04:30:48.910 --> 04:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
district makes decisions for those
 
04:30:52.030 --> 04:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
people that voted for him and on a
 
04:30:53.670 --> 04:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
technicality because he got a lawyer
 
04:30:55.790 --> 04:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
that said at the time of his election he
 
04:30:58.790 --> 04:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
lived in Derry that has to change and I
 
04:31:00.750 --> 04:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
tried changing that four years ago with
 
04:31:03.510 --> 04:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative Barbara Griffin but it
 
04:31:05.309 --> 04:31:05.319 align:start position:0%
was late in the air and we couldn't do
 
04:31:07.990 --> 04:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
anything so this has been on my mind for
 
04:31:11.070 --> 04:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
this long as you know I was here 9:00
 
04:31:12.269 --> 04:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
this morning and I'm the last last one
 
04:31:14.030 --> 04:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
today so I stay because it's very
 
04:31:17.030 --> 04:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
important so even though Senator G has
 
04:31:19.149 --> 04:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
that word maintain still look at that
 
04:31:20.590 --> 04:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
because they didn't take that that
 
04:31:22.910 --> 04:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
wording out at the time of the
 
04:31:25.550 --> 04:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
election um
 
04:31:28.229 --> 04:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
and if you're concerned about the fact
 
04:31:29.990 --> 04:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
that if you redistrict you know how
 
04:31:31.790 --> 04:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
would that work maybe that wording came
 
04:31:33.910 --> 04:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
in because of redistricting they always
 
04:31:37.269 --> 04:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
have a language that um that protects
 
04:31:39.149 --> 04:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
those that are already elected while
 
04:31:41.229 --> 04:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
redistricting so please take a look at
 
04:31:42.550 --> 04:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
that and change that that's very
 
04:31:44.429 --> 04:31:44.439 align:start position:0%
important so thank you very much I I'll
 
04:31:47.149 --> 04:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
take any questions if anyone has
 
04:31:50.790 --> 04:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
any thank you Mr chair aello perfect I'm
 
04:31:53.030 --> 04:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
going to cut the chair will cut in line
 
04:31:56.309 --> 04:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
and ask the first question um so with
 
04:31:58.630 --> 04:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
regard to Senator Gray's Amendment you
 
04:32:01.910 --> 04:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
you you spoke to your concern about the
 
04:32:05.309 --> 04:32:05.319 align:start position:0%
the phrase at the time of their or his
 
04:32:08.349 --> 04:32:08.359 align:start position:0%
election or their election so just to be
 
04:32:11.469 --> 04:32:11.479 align:start position:0%
clear the inclusion in Senator Gray's
 
04:32:11.479 --> 04:32:12.710 align:start position:0%
clear the inclusion in Senator Gray's
Amendment

04:32:12.710 --> 04:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:32:16.269 --> 04:32:16.279 align:start position:0%
on line eight of the word maintain is
 
04:32:20.070 --> 04:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
that sufficient or do you feel we need
 
04:32:24.229 --> 04:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
to take a second look add extra could
 
04:32:26.309 --> 04:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
you just clarify that yeah and and I
 
04:32:28.269 --> 04:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative turot actually
 
04:32:30.189 --> 04:32:30.199 align:start position:0%
shared the amendment with me because he
 
04:32:33.389 --> 04:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
knew I had a concern so I would still
 
04:32:36.229 --> 04:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
look at it because being in the real
 
04:32:38.070 --> 04:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
estate I that's what I do for a living
 
04:32:40.710 --> 04:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
real estate maintain could mean a number
 
04:32:42.510 --> 04:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
of different things
 
04:32:44.670 --> 04:32:44.680 align:start position:0%
I just don't want to see what happened
 
04:32:48.109 --> 04:32:48.119 align:start position:0%
to um you know four years ago with that
 
04:32:50.389 --> 04:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner really I mean ethically he
 
04:32:52.109 --> 04:32:52.119 align:start position:0%
really should have stepped down but he
 
04:32:54.910 --> 04:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
didn't and U again he he used it as a
 
04:32:57.590 --> 04:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
technicality and it's just
 
04:32:59.750 --> 04:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
wrong I'm not an attorney I don't
 
04:33:01.149 --> 04:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
pretend to be an attorney I would just
 
04:33:03.429 --> 04:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
have someone look at both Senator and I
 
04:33:04.629 --> 04:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
heard Senator gray say if there's
 
04:33:06.869 --> 04:33:06.879 align:start position:0%
anything additional he's willing to fix
 
04:33:08.750 --> 04:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
it as well but just take a look at that
 
04:33:11.830 --> 04:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind thank you thank you
 
04:33:14.310 --> 04:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
04:33:16.349 --> 04:33:16.359 align:start position:0%
speaker representative Murphy do you
 
04:33:18.269 --> 04:33:18.279 align:start position:0%

04:36:38.310 --> 04:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
I must have been looking at something
 
04:36:42.429 --> 04:36:42.439 align:start position:0%
wrong but so the next tentative date is
 
04:36:48.949 --> 04:36:48.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:54.029 --> 04:36:54.039 align:start position:0%

when I get home any other additional
[Laughter]

04:37:18.070 --> 04:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:37:20.670 --> 04:37:20.680 align:start position:0%

04:37:20.680 --> 04:37:22.910 align:start position:0%
questions okay rep thank you
representative

04:37:22.910 --> 04:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:37:26.830 --> 04:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
France if we have um County commitments
 
04:37:29.310 --> 04:37:29.320 align:start position:0%
on Monday how do we handle
 
04:37:33.390 --> 04:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
that um thank you for the question so
 
04:37:35.910 --> 04:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
the reason that we're not going to meet
 
04:37:39.830 --> 04:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
on that Monday which is I believe the
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
last week in January is because at this
 
04:37:44.990 --> 04:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
point in time it has been brought to my
 
04:37:47.670 --> 04:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
attention that I this committee has at
 
04:37:50.629 --> 04:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
least three members who will not be able
 
04:37:54.670 --> 04:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
to attend so again we don't have all the
 
04:37:57.029 --> 04:37:57.039 align:start position:0%
bills referred to this committee so I
 
04:37:59.990 --> 04:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
need to sort out what our workload is
 
04:38:01.709 --> 04:38:01.719 align:start position:0%
going to be and whether or not we're
 
04:38:04.629 --> 04:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
going to have a hearing or a full
 
04:38:09.750 --> 04:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
executive session or half and half so
 
04:38:13.510 --> 04:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a good idea to to have it
 
04:38:15.189 --> 04:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
when I I know at least three people
 
04:38:16.230 --> 04:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
won't be
 
04:38:16.240 --> 04:38:18.269 align:start position:0%
won't be
here

04:38:18.269 --> 04:38:18.279 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:38:21.029 --> 04:38:21.039 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's on
 
04:38:23.830 --> 04:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
Thursday we can talk offline with
 
04:38:29.230 --> 04:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:32.750 --> 04:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
want okay any further
 
04:38:35.709 --> 04:38:35.719 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing none again thank
 
04:38:39.910 --> 04:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
