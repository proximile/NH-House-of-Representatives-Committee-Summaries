family and if you want to sit up here
 
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
that's great David you're the smartest
 
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
guy in the room of this bill feel free
 
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
to come up here if you want uh I just
 
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
find it easier than staring at a dark
 
00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 align:start position:0%
cloud space back there anyways this is
 
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
the um interim study subcommittee for
 
00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
554 um Prime sponsor is David lungren
 
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
who is here today which is um great um I
 
00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
wanted to begin by just reminding people
 
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
what the purpose of this bill is and why
 
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
we're here and why this is important as
 
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
many of us know there was a quote opioid
 
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
crisis um that happened um I personally
 
00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:09.759 align:start position:0%
believe that it was disingenuous that
 
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
all the blame for the opioid crisis was
 
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
placed on pharmaceutical companies
 
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 align:start position:0%
because there was plenty of blame to go
 
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
around one of the faults of the Health
 
00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 align:start position:0%
Care system was a failure to provide
 
00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
access to multiple therapies or
 
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
alternative therapies preferably an
 
00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
integrative manner um this bill has come
 
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 align:start position:0%
up several times twice through um
 
00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639 align:start position:0%
representative lungren and it's an
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
attempt to try to increase access to
 
00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 align:start position:0%
therapies that we know have value um and
 
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
next question is how can we do such in a
 
00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
coste effective manner that doesn't
 
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily burden one group over
 
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 align:start position:0%
another but in the end helps the people
 
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to serve so that's why
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
we're here today um this is our second
 
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
meeting um I handed out an agenda for
 
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
everybody and the first order of
 
00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
business is for those of us that were
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
here before was the minutes from last
 
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
time um are there any questions about
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
that comments thoughts whatever I don't
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
remember what that what's that yeah I
 
00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
know was it your it was your comment it
 
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
was my comment but I have I mean I think
 
00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:16.759 align:start position:0%
it sort of says enough without another
 
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
word added so for the for the record in
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
the minutes um I I you're looking at the
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
guy that kept them and I didn't write it
 
00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
up till about a month later and Bill
 
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
made probably the most astute comment a
 
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer sorry made the
 
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
most astute comment that will ever be
 
00:07:37.869 --> 00:07:37.879 align:start position:0%
made at a legislative session and I
 
00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
couldn't read my own handwriting so um
 
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
it never got documented so um I just
 
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to give a brief overview of where
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
we were where and where we're going but
 
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:51.800 align:start position:0%
um I think the one thing that came out
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
of this was that we pretty much were in
 
00:07:57.749 --> 00:07:57.759 align:start position:0%
agreement that we need to move forward
 
00:07:57.759 --> 00:07:59.629 align:start position:0%
agreement that we need to move forward
um

00:07:59.629 --> 00:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that was brought up
 
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
that was actually brought up in our
 
00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879 align:start position:0%
integrative pain committee also was
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
what's actually the definition of pain
 
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
which is why that's the second order of
 
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
the the um the meeting today um the
 
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
third issue that we raised was that
 
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
whatever we do needs to be evidencebased
 
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
um but also that um the evidence base
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
that we use is consistent with that used
 
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:25.400 align:start position:0%
for other modalities for example we
 
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
can't give certain allopathic treatments
 
00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:30.599 align:start position:0%
of fair uh Free Ride merely because
 
00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
they're allopathic um the the the um
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
level of evidence should be similar um
 
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:41.240 align:start position:0%
we should be fair to insurers um it's a
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
tough world right now and we should be
 
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
fair to them we need to be fair to
 
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:47.720 align:start position:0%
Consumers and uh we need to be fair to
 
00:08:50.829 --> 00:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
the Health Care System um and so that's
 
00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
where we are today so um as this next
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
are there any questions about that
 
00:08:59.790 --> 00:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
thoughts comments whatever Mr chairman
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
yes um it's been a while since I read
 
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:04.360 align:start position:0%
the bill are those currently addressed
 
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:05.800 align:start position:0%
in the bill or that are those things
 
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:07.240 align:start position:0%
that would need to be added to a new
 
00:09:11.069 --> 00:09:11.079 align:start position:0%
bill um the way so the bill that you
 
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
have in your hand is my proposal for um
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
this is the current bill the amended
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
version yeah the yes everything that's
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
there is in that bill we everything you
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
just mentioned is in here yes okay great
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
thanks with the yes everything's in
 
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
there with one subtle difference and
 
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
that's what we're about to talk about
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
now um so what I did was um when we so
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
the third item on the agenda is to talk
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
about the definition of pain and um I'm
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
not going to burden this group with this
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
but when we did our integrative Pain
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
Care committee meeting that was the
 
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
first item that was brought up is
 
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
defining pain which then went on for a
 
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.350 align:start position:0%
defining pain which then went on for a
two-day

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
two-day
 
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
discussion um and I don't think all of
 
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
us prefer want to be here but in the end
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
the version that you have right in front
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
of you is what we came up with um the
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
International Association for the study
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
of pain redefine this in
 
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
2020 um what's in red um on that handout
 
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
is additions that we made to their
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
definition um do you have that um I can
 
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
give you that one I'm sorry I put them
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
one Mr chairman is this the language
 
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
that appears on page four no no in the
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
Bly itself you mean well I'm looking no
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
no it's um I can get you
 
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:37.720 align:start position:0%
copy they're right uh they're right over
 
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.710 align:start position:0%
copy they're right uh they're right over
there

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
yeah y so this is the subtle difference
 
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
is what's there is not what's in the
 
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
bill what's in the bill is the historic
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
um International Association for
 
00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:52.460 align:start position:0%
actually thank
 
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.910 align:start position:0%
actually thank
[Applause]

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
you so I I just want to be sure I'm
 
00:10:59.629 --> 00:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
looking at the right piece of paper it's
 
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
not that in in fact you this has a lot
 
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
that's been struck out but it's got
 
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
stuff that's left in exactly so this is
 
00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:09.399 align:start position:0%
going to Super see what's in here maybe
 
00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
that's the point of discussion should it
 
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll give you a couple minutes to
 
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
go over
 
00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:24.839 align:start position:0%
that is this the one that be you brought
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
back on the floor a special no no yeah
 
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
actually right it does yes it was for
 
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
bill but you got a good
 
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
7 Lucy hasn't hit 30
 
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:52.600 align:start position:0%

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
video this meeting should be live stream
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
all right fine which means take your
 
00:12:04.829 --> 00:12:04.839 align:start position:0%
microphone off again I'm not supposed to
 
00:12:04.839 --> 00:12:35.470 align:start position:0%
microphone off again I'm not supposed to
advertise

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
so just as a drafting question because
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
I'm now working off of this which is I
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
think what's under
 
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
consideration are you
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
considering putting the clarifying Parts
 
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
into the bill or is that what's under
 
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
discussion at this point that's under
 
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
discussion I think it's kind
 
00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:57.079 align:start position:0%
of just as a
 
00:12:59.710 --> 00:12:59.720 align:start position:0%
background are we ready to talk about
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
it so um so historically if you look at
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
the first paragraph the uh definition of
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
chronic pain up till the end of the
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
three um eliminate the red items in that
 
00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
first paragraph that's the historic
 
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
definition we've always used it's pretty
 
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
much what's in the bill um it became
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
apparent by 2020 that it you know for
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
reasons that we actually brought up at
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
our committee our integrative Pain Care
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
committee meeting that it wasn't
 
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
sufficient and so so um they
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
commissioned another study group to look
 
00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:34.279 align:start position:0%
at that and redefine it and so that's
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
where the rest of that came from I mean
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
it's I think if you add patience
 
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
centered in three months to the
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
definition you probably done enough for
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
the legislative element of it but I'd be
 
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
happy to see what other people think
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
because the rest of this in my world is
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
like really important and what we're
 
00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
doing in the integrative Pain Care
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
committee it's really important I don't
 
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
question I haven't encountered the word
 
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
NOS acception
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
before so in a nutshell pain uh exists
 
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
is there's two elements to pain there's
 
00:14:16.749 --> 00:14:16.759 align:start position:0%
no susception and suffering no
 
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
susception is the actual neural process
 
00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959 align:start position:0%
by which a a neural vending is
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
stimulated and gives your brain a
 
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
sensation that something hurts and you
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
develop a reactive response suffering is
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
the element that you know that's more of
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
the emotional and diffuse response to
 
00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
the painful stimulation and so in the
 
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
chronic pain world they're both
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
important and at some point actually the
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
suffering is more important than the no
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
susception but they're both important
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
okay I I I I would think that you know
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
you know as you go forward with this
 
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
bill um the definition of pain should be
 
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
more or as succinct as
 
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
possible um I think the meat of this
 
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839 align:start position:0%
bill has more to do with the insurers
 
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
the providers the medical system in
 
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
general and I would argue that you know
 
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
the the the definitions that you put
 
00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:22.519 align:start position:0%
down there in the bullet points may not
 
00:15:22.519 --> 00:15:23.310 align:start position:0%
down there in the bullet points may not
be

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
necessary uh except to understand it
 
00:15:26.749 --> 00:15:26.759 align:start position:0%
better for
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
ourselves um
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
and my one of my other questions is I I
 
00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem with patient
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
centered I I do wonder about why it was
 
00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
necessary to change the current
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
definition and why the addition of the
 
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
lasting more than three months is in
 
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
there as
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
well for our purposes we needed to
 
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
Define for the integrative Pain Care
 
00:15:50.309 --> 00:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
committee we needed to Define what group
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
of people we were going to Target so we
 
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
were going to Target people like when
 
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
you that level of care was probably
 
00:15:59.710 --> 00:15:59.720 align:start position:0%
excessive for somebody who for Less Than
 
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
3 months so we kind of arbitrarily came
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
up with a 3mon definition for what we're
 
00:16:08.309 --> 00:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
doing here today it's it's it's not
 
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
important okay so I mean I the patient
 
00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
centered actually interestingly I think
 
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the minutes you're
 
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
the one who raised the patient centered
 
00:16:19.309 --> 00:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
thing and I to me
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
that's it's it's absolutely critical
 
00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
because we we're providing healthc care
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
based on algorithms that are lumping
 
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
everybody into one giant category and
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
and we're trying really hard in
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
healthcare to not do that um but in the
 
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
business model that's the way it's
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
done thank so so yeah I mean the patient
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
centered sort of can incorporate a lot
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
of these bullet points so that's nice
 
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
the only thing about the three months is
 
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
um so if we're talking about insurance
 
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
coverage then that that's kind of
 
00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
important whether we put it in or not
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
because you if it's only two months then
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
maybe it's not covered if we put in
 
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
three months so I guess that's the
 
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
question is should we should there be a
 
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
time limit in the bill at all or is
 
00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
that that's my question it's a good
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
question and the reason I would say we
 
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
don't need to put it in is because this
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
bill is addressing both acute and
 
00:17:20.029 --> 00:17:20.039 align:start position:0%
chronic pain so the time frame really
 
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
motions I have a left sided field
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
neglect here I should probably be over
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
in that corner or
 
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
something we'll wait for
 
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
him so just just to recap um I mean what
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
I was about to suggest is that you have
 
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
two definitions one one being pain and
 
00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
one being chronic pain which has the
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
durational aspect but if people are
 
00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
satisfied that all we're defined with
 
00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
for respect of this legislation you can
 
00:18:04.029 --> 00:18:04.039 align:start position:0%
just go with the definition of pain and
 
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
not have to decide what the what the
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
limitations are but it it's it's easy
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
just to Define make the two different
 
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
definitions um it's interesting just Pat
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
our sponsor on the back if you look at
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
outcome data the most efficient way of
 
00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with acute loac pain is actually
 
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
with chiropractic care and that was the
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
whole purpose of this bill was to try to
 
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
increase access to that as an
 
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist I know my treatments work
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
much better on acute pain than chronic
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
pain and that and virtually all of us
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
can all of us healthc care providers in
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
the room can say that that's that's true
 
00:18:45.149 --> 00:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
and so um that's why the time element I
 
00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:47.559 align:start position:0%
don't think needs to be defined here but
 
00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:49.400 align:start position:0%
if we feel strongly that it should be
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
that's fine representative mer mer thank
 
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh during the discussion I
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
think one of the reasons for the three
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
months was trying to
 
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
find a demarcation to separate chronic
 
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
from acute and again back to the
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
insurance is having something in there
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
as a timeline to help the insurance
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
folks and everybody else and providers
 
00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
that represent Mercy Murphy brought up
 
00:19:15.549 --> 00:19:15.559 align:start position:0%
as well is where is that line from
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
between acute and chronic it's not
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
specific but we had to draw something
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere the other side of the coin too
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
when talk about patient
 
00:19:26.909 --> 00:19:26.919 align:start position:0%
centered when you start talking about
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
pain what I began to to understand a lot
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
of pain is subject to the person's own
 
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:37.640 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the pain so what may
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
work for one patient may not work for
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
another one and when we get into the
 
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
issue of who should decide what works
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
and what doesn't work it really should
 
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
come down to the patient because it
 
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
maybe things that the patient the
 
00:19:52.029 --> 00:19:52.039 align:start position:0%
studies say it doesn't work a lot of
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
times pain can be controlled by a
 
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
placebo it's the mental part of it and
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
that's what Dr McKay represent M was
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
talking about as well we can't forget
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
about the human brain and that part of
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
it has to be there too which is
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes the emotional side of it so
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's why those two things were woven
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
in there one was to give some sort of
 
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
diff differentiation between chronic and
 
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
acute and also be sure that we're
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
centered on the patient and what
 
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
they're providing to the provider and
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
saying what works and what doesn't work
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
versus somebody saying well there's no
 
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
article out there there's no science
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
behind it well a lot of times when
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
you're treating pain it doesn't always
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
come down to the science comes down to
 
00:20:29.159 --> 00:20:32.990 align:start position:0%
come down to the science comes down to
the

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
patient but I don't think you
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
can I mean it's certainly true that
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
amongst different modalities one might
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
work better for a given patient but I
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
don't think we can ask for an insurance
 
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
company to cover something for which
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
evidence because the fact if one patient
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
says you know ground rhino horns just
 
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
makes my back pain so much better I
 
00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
don't think we want to you know have
 
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
insurance compan feel that I mean if you
 
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
see what I mean yeah I I totally agree
 
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
with what you're saying R Palmer the
 
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
challenge though is that when you get
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
into science and trying to get into
 
00:21:12.029 --> 00:21:12.039 align:start position:0%
something as
 
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:14.440 align:start position:0%
evidence-based we put sometimes so much
 
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
at so much emphasis on the evidence that
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's it seems you do drug
 
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
trials for for example we know that the
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
drug may work in a certain population
 
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't work in all the
 
00:21:28.669 --> 00:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
population so therefore when you look at
 
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
and saying well the study says it works
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
but the patient will tell you it doesn't
 
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
work because it doesn't work in that
 
00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:36.919 align:start position:0%
subpopulation so even though we have
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
trials and we have evidence-based it
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
should not be construed that we have to
 
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
rely upon it completely so that's why
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to be sure of is that even
 
00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
though the science is there we have some
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
way for the patient's involvement and
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
well so it sounds to me like um one of
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%
the things you might want to think about
 
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
is viewing the evidence base as a floor
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
rather than a ceiling because we do know
 
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm just thinking about the usual
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
painkillers that people buy in the drug
 
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
stores some of them work for some people
 
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
and some of them work for other people
 
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
and some of them have side effects for
 
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
some people and for other people they
 
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.149 align:start position:0%
some people and for other people they
don't

00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:22:24.909 --> 00:22:24.919 align:start position:0%
so and I'm not sure for purposes of the
 
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
bill you need to Define this completely
 
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
but um I think some kind of
 
00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
floor of scientific evidence is
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
important but uh the thing that I
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
learned through my late husband's Cancer
 
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
Treatments was I always thought that you
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
know you had condition a you
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
administered pills C and you B and got
 
00:22:48.029 --> 00:22:48.039 align:start position:0%
results C and of course that's
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
completely untrue it's it's far more art
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
it's an art and a science and and that's
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
why I like the patient centered
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
point because that's what you're looking
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
for is what works for this patient but
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
with some guard rails on it the Rhino
 
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
horn and this is where we get into the
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
problem is who gets to Define what the
 
00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
evidence base actually is and and it's
 
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
when we did our prior authorization
 
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
Bill one of the big problems that we
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
found was that each insurer get is using
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
their own evidence base and you know
 
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
without any ability really for us as
 
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
practitioners to question what's your
 
00:23:34.269 --> 00:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
evidence base why are you using it one
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
of them I'm going to cite my book again
 
00:23:38.269 --> 00:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
sorry but one of the more CH important
 
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
chapters in that book was Miss and
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
realities about evidence-based medicine
 
00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
and there was a study of the Cochran um
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
Cochran uh Cochran data collection which
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
is the largest collection of
 
00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
evidence-based medicine in the world
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's held in Scotland and um not that
 
00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
you need to know that but anyways um
 
00:23:57.789 --> 00:23:57.799 align:start position:0%
what they did was they looked at 1,00
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
medical question questions and to find
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
how many do we have no facts how many
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
are satisfied Beyond um you know
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
question whatever they found out only 3%
 
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
of medical questions among the 1100 were
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
settled Beyond question which means that
 
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
97% of medical questions there's a
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
question and and so that the reality is
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
there are no facts and and that's where
 
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
we get back to Patient centered care and
 
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
that's to me be honest you have in maybe
 
00:24:28.389 --> 00:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
inadvertently raised the most important
 
00:24:32.389 --> 00:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
part of this bill um to me
 
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
personally thank you
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
sir one of the other things that was
 
00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
discussed was if it is patient
 
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
centered instead of trying to
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
micromanage it is trying to find a way
 
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
if we could is give the patient a um a
 
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
bundle if you will of dollars that they
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
could utilize and let them at that point
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
in time be more in charge of how those
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
dollars get allocated
 
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
on their care for chronic pain and let
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
them sort of have more stewardship over
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
how those resources are being utilized
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
versus us at that point in time trying
 
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
to say well this works this is carbonet
 
00:25:12.029 --> 00:25:12.039 align:start position:0%
because it becomes so difficult trying
 
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
to figure out what to include and what
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
not to include an example in
 
00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
hospice they don't you in hospice you
 
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:23.240 align:start position:0%
get a certain amount of money per DM per
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
day but it's up to the hospice
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
organization to decide how to utilize
 
00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
the dollars and it's up for them to
 
00:25:31.549 --> 00:25:31.559 align:start position:0%
decide what works and what doesn't work
 
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
and what they want to use the money for
 
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
so that kind of breaks it apart so the
 
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
insurance industry has some sort of
 
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
obligation to the patient but at the
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
same time there's also some Freedom
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
within the patient themselves the how
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
those dolls get utilized between
 
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
themselves and providers and so forth so
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
if they want to use an aai Chi because
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
it works there's a limited number of
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
dollars that are available that helps
 
00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
reduce the risk factor from the
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
insurance company because from a
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
Financial Risk at the same time gives
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
resources I mean that's
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
it thank you that's an interesting idea
 
00:26:10.389 --> 00:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
the only thing the difference is that in
 
00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
hospice the hospice team medical team is
 
00:26:16.269 --> 00:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
working with the patient to decide so
 
00:26:18.269 --> 00:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
it's not just a patient driven thing the
 
00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:20.120 align:start position:0%
patient doesn't have unlimited options
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
of what the hospice agency is going to
 
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:25.640 align:start position:0%
pay for and um so having been a hospice
 
00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:27.320 align:start position:0%
medical director for a number of years I
 
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
mean we certainly had
 
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:32.559 align:start position:0%
people I mean you know like Father Gil
 
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
taking a guy fishing was uh one of the
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
ways we spent some of the hospice money
 
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
I think he was actually volunteer but
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
um but that wasn't that wasn't a medical
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
treatment but it was very good for the
 
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
patient but as far as medications or
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
other treatments it's still got to be
 
00:26:55.789 --> 00:26:55.799 align:start position:0%
ordered by a doctor so presumably the
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
doctor's not going to order the ground
 
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
Rhino horn um so there has to be some B
 
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
balance because because otherwise sorry
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise otherwise the the only other
 
00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
way I would think you could do it would
 
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
be to make a list of different things
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
that would be covered which then gets to
 
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
be either very difficult to do in you
 
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
know a huge negotiation or um or or it's
 
00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
going to be limiting in slightly
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I thought you were going to
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
speak um I you know I I don't disagree
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
with everything that is been said so far
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
and from a clinical perspective your
 
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
your thoughts that the definition of
 
00:27:46.029 --> 00:27:46.039 align:start position:0%
chronic pain and particularly patient
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
centered approach to it is very
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
important to us I I understand that and
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
I would not disagree with any of the
 
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
bullet points though I don't believe
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
that they need to be included in the
 
00:27:59.149 --> 00:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
bill itself per se My suggest is that
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
the definition of chronic pain could be
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
as previously stated with the addition
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
of pain centered because I think that
 
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:07.240 align:start position:0%
the major part of the bill that is going
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
to be controversial is going to be the
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
burden that's put upon providers and
 
00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:15.399 align:start position:0%
upon insurance coverage so my my sense
 
00:28:17.389 --> 00:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
going forward would be that we look at
 
00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
the the what we have written down as
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
chronic pain and modified with patient
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
centered because it is patient centered
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
in many ways but I I and I agree with it
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
as being very
 
00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
important but I think that we really
 
00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:34.360 align:start position:0%
ought to be getting to some of the more
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
controversial parts of the bill that are
 
00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
going to be what is mandated for
 
00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:41.799 align:start position:0%
providers and for insurance coverage to
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
um to be included within the bill would
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
you keep the three months or remove it I
 
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:49.240 align:start position:0%
would remove it y perfect I because I
 
00:28:51.389 --> 00:28:51.399 align:start position:0%
think simple is better and the reason I
 
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
would remove it is because I think that
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
pain is a very subjective thing as soon
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
as we start getting into more of the
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
detail s involved the mandates of 3
 
00:29:02.909 --> 00:29:02.919 align:start position:0%
months and the time periods involved etc
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
etc the more uh difficult it's going to
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
be to be as a provider provide coverage
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
for that pain um so and I'm glad you
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
said what you said because we are
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
getting into the discussion of mandates
 
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
that's a big deal yeah and I mean I'm
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
fine with
 
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
that I totally I'm perfect with that I
 
00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
I would there be some
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
um consideration by the committee to
 
00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:36.519 align:start position:0%
include the word usually lasting more
 
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
than three
 
00:29:39.549 --> 00:29:39.559 align:start position:0%
months which gives a little more
 
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
flexibility again the same thing I'm
 
00:29:42.909 --> 00:29:42.919 align:start position:0%
just trying to look at it from the
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
insurance point of view but me some
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
words I actually go ahead for the
 
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
purposes of this bill didn't I
 
00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
understand people to say that we don't
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
need a definition of chronic pain we
 
00:29:57.549 --> 00:29:57.559 align:start position:0%
just need a definition of pain exactly
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
yes and therefore uh we don't need to do
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
the limits and if there's something
 
00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:05.519 align:start position:0%
farther on in the bill that addresses a
 
00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
chronic condition then we can look back
 
00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
to that but um I speaking as the most
 
00:30:16.029 --> 00:30:16.039 align:start position:0%
lay of lay people here
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
um anytime somebody says to me you know
 
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
lasting more than 3 months that means
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
that somebody's got to hurt for 90 days
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
before something happens and and don't
 
00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:30.919 align:start position:0%
want to get into a situation where we're
 
00:30:33.389 --> 00:30:33.399 align:start position:0%
um arguing about that down the road so
 
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
unless there's a reason in which case we
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
should Define pain and then Define
 
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
chronic pain I'd just leave it as pain
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
and and go forward there and then deal
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
with the meat of the bill which is going
 
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
to be um the thing that's going to cause
 
00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:51.559 align:start position:0%
pain among our colleagues um I would I
 
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
would second that and I would say that
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
it was an Omission on my or yeah
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
Commission on my part chronic should not
 
00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
have been here it should have just been
 
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:01.720 align:start position:0%
definition of pain so are we then I
 
00:31:04.029 --> 00:31:04.039 align:start position:0%
missed that part sorry about that we're
 
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:06.200 align:start position:0%
deleting the word chronic in the
 
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
definition so it's just definition of
 
00:31:09.789 --> 00:31:09.799 align:start position:0%
pain exactly okay thank
 
00:31:09.799 --> 00:31:13.509 align:start position:0%
pain exactly okay thank
you

00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
yes McDonald sorry thank you Mr chairman
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
yeah getting back to representative
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
Murphy's comment about the uh the
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
insurers uh I think that's a number one
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
hurdle in this bill from everyone I've
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
talked to in the house um and um I I
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
know at least one lobbyist is here from
 
00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
I think representing insurers I think
 
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
that's one of your clients right uh so
 
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's the number one challenge I
 
00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
think this bill has and and it's an
 
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
important bill and I I'd love to see it
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
become law but that is going to be a
 
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
major consideration in uh talking about
 
00:31:47.389 --> 00:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
stakeholders talking about people who
 
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
need to be in the discussion and so
 
00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
forth I think that's a probably our
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
biggest hurdle and our greatest priority
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
so are we okay with the definition as
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
we've as representative Murphy has
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
proposed and all of us actually so just
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
to be clear we're going to your your
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
suggestion is that definition of pain as
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
you wrote it out there we eliminate
 
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
chronic pain keep patient centered in
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
lasting more than three months is what
 
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
you would include in okay were you okay
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
with that I am do I we don't need to
 
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
make motions and things like that right
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
and that simply means that to go back to
 
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
the thing that looks like a bill what
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to do is insert the words
 
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
patient centered and the rest of it
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
stays exactly the same
 
00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:43.240 align:start position:0%
perfect good
 
00:32:47.629 --> 00:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
job who says government can't accomplish
 
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
things so um that brings us to the next
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
thing where we actually look at this
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
bill so I I I just want to reiterate
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
some of the background of this bill
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
where it came from um um this bill I
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
think has been proposed three or four
 
00:33:06.029 --> 00:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
times now um representative maputi did
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
it first and then representative lungren
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
took up the flag um and then we had met
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
be well before I became a legislator um
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
we put to because we thought that this
 
00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
bill was really important so what we did
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
was we took the bill because we at at
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
the medical society had concerns about
 
00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
it but I also work with the US pain
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
foundation and um the woman that I work
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
with there um Cindy Steinberg who's not
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
here today um she's their legislative
 
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative nationally and she's also
 
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
their chair um in Massachusetts and they
 
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:41.720 align:start position:0%
had actually created a somewhat similar
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
Bill there um so what we did was we
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
looked at the bill that they had created
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
and we brought her across state um we
 
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
put together a work group um that
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
consisted of a couple docs me I'm a doc
 
00:34:00.629 --> 00:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
um um Cindy and um the reason why Cindy
 
00:34:02.669 --> 00:34:02.679 align:start position:0%
was important Not only was in her
 
00:34:04.629 --> 00:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
legislative role but she's also a
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
patient with chronic pain so um and she
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
represents millions of people not just a
 
00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:14.200 align:start position:0%
couple so um we sat down we went through
 
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
the bill um and what ended up coming up
 
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
with was of of taking a lot of what
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative lungren had created
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
changing it in a manner that that the
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
medical society could back
 
00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:30.919 align:start position:0%
um be a little bit more specific about
 
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
what we were after eliminate a couple
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
things like there was a report in there
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
that um probably isn't necessary we
 
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
could go over that in detail um and then
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
we came up with a format that ended up
 
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
getting submitted as House Bill 303 that
 
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:46.919 align:start position:0%
then got attached to what was the
 
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
original 554 was I don't remember the
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
original bill number from a couple years
 
00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
ago but so now we functionally have two
 
00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
bills that are side by side so what I
 
00:34:59.230 --> 00:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
tried to do in going through this um
 
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
with the red and the and what was struck
 
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
out what wasn't what was added um was to
 
00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
try to morph them into something that's
 
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
a lot shorter simpler and we'll
 
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully accomplish what came through
 
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
in a number of our meetings
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
specifically um the original Bill
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
included a number of things like Chiang
 
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
Tai Chi Yoga that are not um provided by
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
licensed therapists um so the general
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
consensus was that whatever we de within
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
this bill now needs to be done by a
 
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
licensed therapist so the the the things
 
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
in there are like movement therapies
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic osteopathic um something
 
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
that might be done by a PT but it's
 
00:35:40.829 --> 00:35:40.839 align:start position:0%
important to say this bill does not
 
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
include Physical Therapy um massage
 
00:35:46.829 --> 00:35:46.839 align:start position:0%
therapy which is performed by licensed
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
providers acupuncture which is provided
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
by licensed providers psychologic
 
00:35:53.309 --> 00:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
therapies like cognitive behavioral
 
00:35:55.309 --> 00:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
therapies and things like that which are
 
00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:57.880 align:start position:0%
provided by licensed therapists so we
 
00:36:00.589 --> 00:36:00.599 align:start position:0%
really got way more specific on it um
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
and this was done as a a group it wasn't
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
just a me thing and what you're looking
 
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
at is actually a group effort by people
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
that represent pain people represent
 
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
doctors um the one missing pieces is
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
insures and what we've tried to do is
 
00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
include you guys in this too so that we
 
00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
get something hopefully that'll be nice
 
00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.309 align:start position:0%
get something hopefully that'll be nice
for

00:36:21.309 --> 00:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
everybody so I'm still looking at at
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
this document in front of me um
 
00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
and so is the proposal going forward
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
limited to the um uh wording in red
 
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
because I've got wording in Black which
 
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
sort of looks to me like it's staying in
 
00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:46.839 align:start position:0%
the bill and if it is then on page five
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
we still have aquatic therapy yoga Quang
 
00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:51.510 align:start position:0%
we still have aquatic therapy yoga Quang
and

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
taii which are the modalities that are
 
00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
less likely to be licensed profession
 
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
thanks for bringing what line on page
 
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
I'm on page five and I'm on line 10 and
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
11 yeah that will need to be removed
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I just I just want to make
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
sure we're all no thank you cuz that's
 
00:37:13.309 --> 00:37:13.319 align:start position:0%
important looking at the same thing yeah
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
anything in red that's struck is it was
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
original um that's been taken out
 
00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:21.839 align:start position:0%
anything that's in that's red now was
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
either moved from one place to another
 
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
or is new and anything in black is
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
original that's staying okay which which
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
document are we looking at oh it's the
 
00:37:32.589 --> 00:37:32.599 align:start position:0%
thing that says bill number at the top
 
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
and it's 5,000 pages long so you're
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
going to strike lines not um not all of
 
00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
line because some of the movement
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
therapies uh physical therapists and
 
00:37:49.069 --> 00:37:49.079 align:start position:0%
chiropractors are certainly licensed
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
professionals um and then I'm not sure
 
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
about the ones going forward from there
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
but I just think you need to make a note
 
00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
that somewhere there you're going to
 
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
have to start drawing lines I don't know
 
00:38:02.589 --> 00:38:02.599 align:start position:0%
if I can say this out publicly but
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
you're a smarty pants thanks for
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
bringing that up and I mean it's know if
 
00:38:10.309 --> 00:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
you can say it this is this is why I'm
 
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
the token attorney on this committee no
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
and and and I the reason why pts are not
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
included in this is that insurance and
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
physical therapy are not an issue um so
 
00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:24.440 align:start position:0%
that's why we didn't include them in
 
00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:25.589 align:start position:0%
that's why we didn't include them in
this

00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
bill well then I think I think it it
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
it's would you might want to discuss
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
where that sentence ends or if it's
 
00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
included at all I'm just putting a
 
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
question mark by it if I could go back
 
00:38:40.829 --> 00:38:40.839 align:start position:0%
to a comment
 
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
before about the Rhino bones or whatever
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about before if it's
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
ordered by the
 
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
provider would that not be covered now
 
00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:50.839 align:start position:0%
trying to get to with chai Chi and so
 
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
forth that the provider thinks it's
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
going to work to help the patient would
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
that not be the again
 
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
the floor we're talking about where it's
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
being somewhat controlled by a decision
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
by a certified individual that has the
 
00:39:09.069 --> 00:39:09.079 align:start position:0%
license to interpret that repres and and
 
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
I'll just say that
 
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
traditionally um when we've looked at
 
00:39:16.589 --> 00:39:16.599 align:start position:0%
bills like this and it has it has been
 
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
an issue back and forth and I think that
 
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
you know what you're talking about is
 
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
basically having a gatekeeper and
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
somebody with a license has to say yes I
 
00:39:26.309 --> 00:39:26.319 align:start position:0%
think this is going to be helpful for
 
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
this patient but you still have the
 
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
issue and I think it's going to be a
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
very huge issue depending on who the
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
payor is if you are referring to
 
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
somebody who is not subject to license
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
or certification rules of some kind uh
 
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to run up against a huge
 
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
roadblock um I'm I'm pretty sure that
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
the cmc's are not going to be happy with
 
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
that for one thing and and that's a huge
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
amount of the coverage and this may not
 
00:40:02.349 --> 00:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
cover that at all but um it just it has
 
00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
traditionally been an issue going
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
forward repr pal well what I was going
 
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
to say is that I mean the rhino horn
 
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
that's basically like medication and so
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
there are going to be medications that
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
you'd have to go through some prior
 
00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
authorization to get because of whatever
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
reason either because they're very
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
expensive or because there's no you know
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
evidence obviously there'd be a lot of
 
00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.589 align:start position:0%
evidence obviously there'd be a lot of
different

00:40:28.589 --> 00:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
medications that would be helpful in
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
chronic pain and hopefully all of those
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
will get covered assuming there's some
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
rationale but that seems like a SE
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
separate set of stuff from this bill
 
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
which is sort of the um so if I could
 
00:40:47.309 --> 00:40:47.319 align:start position:0%
add to that I mean right now if you look
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
at the healthcare dollar about 2third of
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
the healthc Care dollar and I may be
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
wrong but um at one point this was true
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
is basically out of pocket expenses for
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous other things
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
um you know like Rhino bones or whatever
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
I I I'm not putting that in the minutes
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
but anyway so um um you know that's just
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
people make their make a discretion that
 
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
they're going to conscious choice that
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
that's what they want to do and that's
 
00:41:14.589 --> 00:41:14.599 align:start position:0%
fine um but they pay for it out of their
 
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
own pocket the question we're asking
 
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
here is like what do we expect or what
 
00:41:22.349 --> 00:41:22.359 align:start position:0%
will we like insurers to cover and um
 
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
and I think some things are a bridge too
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
far at this point and maybe on the road
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
yeah you know like if we have licensed
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
chiong therapists and um you know they
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
have really a more organized educational
 
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
program and we have more evidence-based
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
then maybe they would be included in
 
00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:43.240 align:start position:0%
this down the road but at this point
 
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
that's lacking and so um and so that's
 
00:41:50.349 --> 00:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
why at this point we don't feel and this
 
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
is like a big broad group of people that
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
discussed this and how we came to that
 
00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
conclusion I go back to the issue of the
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
gatekeeper mhm it sounds like the
 
00:42:01.309 --> 00:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
gatekeeper is not the patient it's going
 
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
to be the insurance company and that's
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
my concern is that we're
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
now basically turning it over from the
 
00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
patient even though we're saying it's
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
patient centered it comes back to the
 
00:42:14.069 --> 00:42:14.079 align:start position:0%
it's Insurance centered so therefore I'm
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
trying to balance the two and saying how
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
do we ensure that it's truly patient
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
centered and not something through P
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
approvals and the gatekeeper really
 
00:42:22.589 --> 00:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
becomes the insurance company and not
 
00:42:24.549 --> 00:42:24.559 align:start position:0%
the patient and the provider and I don't
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
know where the line is drawn but
 
00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.630 align:start position:0%
know where the line is drawn but
philosophically

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
philosophically
 
00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what i' like to get into
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%
this bill is that we have a balance
 
00:42:32.829 --> 00:42:32.839 align:start position:0%
between the two where that is I don't
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
know can I represent thank you
 
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
um so the bill that you sent to us has a
 
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
lot of what representative Weber is
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
referring to that has been already
 
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
deleted and the reason I mentioned that
 
00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
is because if I read this bill it
 
00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
becomes very succinct and becomes very
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
explicit as to what we're talking about
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
M so referencing representative
 
00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
Merchant's question
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
I as well as a provider don't agree that
 
00:43:04.549 --> 00:43:04.559 align:start position:0%
it should be the purview of the
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
insurance car is to basically mandate
 
00:43:10.549 --> 00:43:10.559 align:start position:0%
what is covered having said that if you
 
00:43:12.549 --> 00:43:12.559 align:start position:0%
look at page one of the one that you
 
00:43:16.349 --> 00:43:16.359 align:start position:0%
sent out to us page one
 
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
um the patients seek treatment from mer
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
conditions that cause pain a certified
 
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
it should be maybe a certified
 
00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider so again it is a
 
00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider that is basically
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
certified and unlike the days of past a
 
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
lot of the education now for opad
 
00:43:35.309 --> 00:43:35.319 align:start position:0%
management particularly in the last 20
 
00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
years is now Incorporated in you know in
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
um uh provider education grant rounds
 
00:43:45.069 --> 00:43:45.079 align:start position:0%
Etc but is also provided and also
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
there's a check in the recertification
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
process so if you want to back up to my
 
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
you know again as nor p in a very simple
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
mind and a lot of this stuff I would
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
basically make the provider the
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
gatekeeper in the sense whether it's the
 
00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
orthopedist the primary care whomever it
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
is that it's a
 
00:44:03.119 --> 00:44:04.950 align:start position:0%
is that it's a
certified

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
certified
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
individual that refers to any one of the
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
other options available so that could be
 
00:44:15.069 --> 00:44:15.079 align:start position:0%
part of a bill and it could be one that
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
is also Incorporated in the physician or
 
00:44:20.829 --> 00:44:20.839 align:start position:0%
provider education programs that they
 
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
have available to them the second part
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
of that then becomes the insurer and
 
00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:29.720 align:start position:0%
that is addressed again in your new copy
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
of this which has deleted so much but I
 
00:44:34.549 --> 00:44:34.559 align:start position:0%
do have concerns and I think the
 
00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers would also agree with
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
me that the insurer is then mandated to
 
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
provide a lot of what is you know uh
 
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
prescribed by the prescribing physician
 
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
or provider um but they mention in page
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
two you mentioned in page two and you
 
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned again in page four that each
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
insurer whether it goes from um on page
 
00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:01.710 align:start position:0%
insurer whether it goes from um on page
two

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:01.720 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:05.480 align:start position:0%
three um uh they they have to basically
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
submit the the insurance um um to or the
 
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
coverage to the um HHS I agree with that
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
that each insurer also has to supply and
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
produce you know again this becomes a
 
00:45:22.349 --> 00:45:22.359 align:start position:0%
bit onerous on the insurers and I get
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
that part of it um produc and Supply
 
00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:27.880 align:start position:0%
with each renewed insured issued
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
policy uh educational materials the
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
educational materials I don't have a
 
00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:35.240 align:start position:0%
problem with providing providers to do
 
00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:36.839 align:start position:0%
that is a different thing altogether but
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
is included in here as well because it
 
00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
says in Roman numeral 6 they sure ensure
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
shall ensure an adequate number in type
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
of licensed professionals that may be a
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
bridge too far and difficult for a lot
 
00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:53.720 align:start position:0%
of people to get to so what I'm looking
 
00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
at here in my simple mind is what does a
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
gate keeper the provider is mandated to
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
do I don't like to legislate Health Care
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
delivery but on the other hand if we
 
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
have something that says they at least
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
should through their educational
 
00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:13.839 align:start position:0%
programs mandate or they should you know
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
prescribe or offer as
 
00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
Alternatives that'd be one thing but
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
then again the insurance carriers have
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
significant burdens that are you know
 
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
placed within this bill as well so I I
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
think we have to try to resolve olve
 
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
those is what I'm saying can I ask a
 
00:46:31.549 --> 00:46:31.559 align:start position:0%
pragmatic question is this
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
recorded it's on live stream I believe
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
so in other words I can because you just
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
said a lot of good stuff and I didn't
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
write any of it down because I wanted to
 
00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
hear it um but if I can go back and
 
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
watch a recording so that we make try
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
simpy this to that the mandates that we
 
00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
are legislating for the healthcare
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
provider MH which I I would I think is
 
00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:55.720 align:start position:0%
important but I think a lot of it is
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
covered now current
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
and maybe some of the the the bills that
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
were previously brought up did not
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
recognize this but there is a lot of
 
00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
educational stuff that's out there and
 
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
is we all know there's providers that
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
basically covers the providers you know
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge base and also their their um
 
00:47:18.549 --> 00:47:18.559 align:start position:0%
uh prescribing techniques and also
 
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
providing alternatives to care but again
 
00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
I want to be sensitive to the insurance
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
carriers and what is mandated in there
 
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
as well um so to me this is like a
 
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
carrot and stick thing like like in the
 
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
medical profession we're being carrot
 
00:47:33.069 --> 00:47:33.079 align:start position:0%
and stick that we have to use an
 
00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
electronic medical record even when we
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
don't want to because they're cost
 
00:47:38.109 --> 00:47:38.119 align:start position:0%
inefficient and they destroy private
 
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
practice so they're using that with us
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
to me this is I'm sorry us you guys them
 
00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
thing but this is important um right now
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
what what I what a lot of us in in the
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
medical field don't understand is you
 
00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
know you can get access to this drug
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
this in surgery that that injection
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
without any problem and the insurer will
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
cover it much of that doesn't have any
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
evidence base at all but they still will
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
cover it however we have evidence that
 
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
chiropractic helps acupuncture helps
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
cognitive behavioral therapy helps
 
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
massage helps we have licensed
 
00:48:14.109 --> 00:48:14.119 align:start position:0%
practitioners that provide those
 
00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
Services we think that they're coste
 
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
effective we know that certain types of
 
00:48:22.829 --> 00:48:22.839 align:start position:0%
surgeries are not cost effective so what
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
this is if it requires a mandate to
 
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
level the playing field so that people
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
have access to all these things all
 
00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
provided by evidence-based licensed
 
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
practitioners then great but in an Ideal
 
00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
World we don't need that mandate that
 
00:48:38.829 --> 00:48:38.839 align:start position:0%
people will
 
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
recognize that these things have value
 
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
and then they should be vited and
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
they're cost effective and we can
 
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
actually maybe decrease cost rather than
 
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
increase cost and the next question then
 
00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
becomes what's the forces that are
 
00:48:52.789 --> 00:48:52.799 align:start position:0%
causing the status quo and that's a
 
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
question I'm not answering here today
 
00:48:57.549 --> 00:48:57.559 align:start position:0%
but I've asked it and so you know that's
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
when I I think when we get down to
 
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
mandates is like well why aren't you
 
00:49:03.789 --> 00:49:03.799 align:start position:0%
doing this and and and yeah everybody
 
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
has said well we do offer this we do
 
00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:07.240 align:start position:0%
offer that we do yeah well you do when
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
you don't and um um you know I can get
 
00:49:13.789 --> 00:49:13.799 align:start position:0%
back surgery tomorrow you know and even
 
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
if I don't need it I can get it and
 
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
you'll pay like 100,000 bucks or
 
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
whatever to get it that doesn't make any
 
00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
sense so it doesn't not not only doesn't
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
make sense it's not cost effective so
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
the chiropractors have saved our butts
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
many times the physical th have saved
 
00:49:28.589 --> 00:49:28.599 align:start position:0%
our butts and saved the insurance
 
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
companies a ton of money by taking care
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
of their shoulder or the elbow whatever
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
it is with a non-surgical approach right
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
as we all know you know medicine has
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
changed dramatically and I would go back
 
00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
to the mid90s when the rvu system came
 
00:49:46.789 --> 00:49:46.799 align:start position:0%
out I think that was horrific having
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
said that it it still is you know the
 
00:49:52.349 --> 00:49:52.359 align:start position:0%
the carrot that is driving a lot of
 
00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:55.720 align:start position:0%
people to do surgeries M and when they
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
could go and have you know something
 
00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:59.190 align:start position:0%
could go and have you know something
done

00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:50:01.549 --> 00:50:01.559 align:start position:0%
non-surgically without a medication or
 
00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
maybe just with physical therapy
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
whatever but what I'm saying is that I I
 
00:50:08.829 --> 00:50:08.839 align:start position:0%
would try to distill this bill down to
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
what we truly want to think about as far
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
as mandating if at all what providers do
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
and I think they do a lot of it already
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
yes but also then you know make sure
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
that you know that is offered to the
 
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
patient that's where the patient
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
centered part becomes very important
 
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
that they are now part of the discussion
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
that acupuncture Physical Therapy Etc is
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
is part of their treatment modalities
 
00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:37.480 align:start position:0%
repres can I ask a simple sort of
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
digressing for a second but I'm going
 
00:50:40.109 --> 00:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
through and looking at the one that's in
 
00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
the black not the one that's in the red
 
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
um it has on top of it House Bill
 
00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
554 oh I I'm reading through this and
 
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
read through it before but it reminded
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
me when I look at
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
line 11 it says we have to try things
 
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
before you can prescribe an opiate then
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
it goes on and talks about nothing
 
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
section and so forth you have to exhaust
 
00:51:13.789 --> 00:51:13.799 align:start position:0%
everything before you can write Opia but
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
then you go down to line
 
00:51:20.349 --> 00:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
21 it's a conflict it says nothing in SE
 
00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
the section so preclude a healthcare
 
00:51:24.069 --> 00:51:24.079 align:start position:0%
practitioner from simultaneously
 
00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
prescribing an opiate or prescribing or
 
00:51:27.549 --> 00:51:27.559 align:start position:0%
recommending any the procedure set forth
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
in paragraph one so therefore when I
 
00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
read through it I'm not a Wordsmith here
 
00:51:36.109 --> 00:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
but if it says here I could WR opiate
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
anyways then why do we say you have to
 
00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:39.880 align:start position:0%
do all these things it's kind of a
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
conflict in there it it was of striking
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
all that I just trying to understand
 
00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
yeah from yeah from writing the law we
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
sort of have built into it a conflict at
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
least I see it as a conflict but I'm not
 
00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
an attorney so I'm looking for somebody
 
00:51:57.309 --> 00:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
who's got more legal than I do I I have
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
more legal e but I only have the copy of
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
the large thing with all the red and the
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
black I don't have the thing that it's
 
00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
actually right over my colleague to the
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
right is is working off of what he's
 
00:52:10.829 --> 00:52:10.839 align:start position:0%
reading from is actually page one and
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
but I hope that strucken part you will
 
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
agree on a particular template to work
 
00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:19.240 align:start position:0%
off of and and keep the notes on one I
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
would like to work off the the one with
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
the red and the
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
black yes well I mean that's in there
 
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.390 align:start position:0%
it's just
struck

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
struck
 
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
right so this is now the one we're not
 
00:52:33.789 --> 00:52:33.799 align:start position:0%
working on so what we did was we took
 
00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
the original Bill and this is where the
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
the challenge becomes is we took the
 
00:52:41.309 --> 00:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
original Bill and then we put together a
 
00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
multi-stakeholder ad hoc group right and
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
then we rewrote it and and what's what's
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
left is I kept some of that let's just
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
go back to First Things yeah we have
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
pieces of paper in front of us yeah this
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
is the original bill it's all in black
 
00:52:58.109 --> 00:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
yeah this is the other thing that I was
 
00:53:00.109 --> 00:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
given which is some black and some red
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
and it's very thick and it's bit cross
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
off but it's not
 
00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
what um has just been referenced by
 
00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
several of the last few speakers which
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
is a completely different document and
 
00:53:16.109 --> 00:53:16.119 align:start position:0%
I'm just hoping that instead of talking
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
about page two on this
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
document uh I mean pick one stick with
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
it and get it to the point my my
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
intention of this discussion is that the
 
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
only Bill that we're only piece that
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with is with the one with
 
00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:31.960 align:start position:0%
the struck stuff and and not struck
 
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
stuff and certainly you're welcome to un
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
strike stuff but that's what we're
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
working from does that make sense no I
 
00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
just I just want to know of these two
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
documents which one you're using I'm
 
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
using the one with the red and the black
 
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh they both have little bits of red and
 
00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
little bits of black this is one with
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
editing on
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
it and this is one that is
 
00:53:59.549 --> 00:53:59.559 align:start position:0%
read the one I sent you is actually the
 
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
same thing it is it's just
 
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
format that was one that I sent out in a
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
Word document to all the members of the
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
yeah got it I'm
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
just but what representative Merchant
 
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
reference yeah what represent a merchant
 
00:54:17.549 --> 00:54:17.559 align:start position:0%
repres reference was the the bill that
 
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
was stuck in front of us today that's
 
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:27.789 --> 00:54:27.799 align:start position:0%
from thank you for that
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
clarification I didn't realize when I
 
00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:31.960 align:start position:0%
sent it to you would come out
 
00:54:35.549 --> 00:54:35.559 align:start position:0%
differently easy read yeah Mr
 
00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
chairman yes
 
00:54:40.109 --> 00:54:40.119 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald to representative
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
Murphy's Point uh obviously this is a
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
complicated issue and we've we're trying
 
00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
to even we're getting a little confused
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
here but if I may reference another bill
 
00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:53.240 align:start position:0%
we just experienced um that came over
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
from the from the other body uh sb44 40
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh that whole optomologist optometrist
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
thing much of the problem with that was
 
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
so complicated so confusing their
 
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
objectives weren't even clear uh and I
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
sat in numerous meetings about that
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
we've got to make this very as
 
00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:11.720 align:start position:0%
straightforward as possible if we're
 
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
going to be successful and the simpler
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
it's got obviously got to address
 
00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
everything properly but it's got to be
 
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
as straightforward as possible if we're
 
00:55:22.029 --> 00:55:22.039 align:start position:0%
going to be successful in getting this
 
00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
passed I think the other thing that
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
confused me a lot CU When we we created
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
a bill that was like a page long and
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
then all of the sudden it goes into to
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
be written up and it comes back a
 
00:55:35.349 --> 00:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
million pages long with references to
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
multiple places and statute and that
 
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
makes this even more confusing because
 
00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
basically all it is is one section
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
struck in two things that are
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
functionally the same thing but written
 
00:55:48.309 --> 00:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
two or three different times and and so
 
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
it probably would be helpful to just
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
on page three starting with line 13 and
 
00:56:01.029 --> 00:56:01.039 align:start position:0%
that's the thing that that's the gist of
 
00:56:03.789 --> 00:56:03.799 align:start position:0%
everything up to page four line 31
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
that's the entire gist of the entire
 
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
bill but it's repeated twice does that
 
00:56:10.589 --> 00:56:10.599 align:start position:0%
make sense because it totally confused
 
00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
me even this morning when I was
 
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
reviewing it it totally confused me but
 
00:56:16.349 --> 00:56:16.359 align:start position:0%
that that is what what the new section
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
is um one of the re one of the other
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
reasons cuz representative um lungren
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
did an awesome job at doing this and
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
bringing it to our attention and forcing
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
and pursuing the issue further the
 
00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:32.440 align:start position:0%
problem was is getting multi-stakeholder
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
support so you know that's kind of how
 
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
we got to where we are right now taking
 
00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
what you started putting it into this
 
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:41.960 align:start position:0%
format and that was what was able to get
 
00:56:44.190 --> 00:56:44.200 align:start position:0%
multistakeholder support and then with
 
00:56:47.589 --> 00:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
the insurance company's in uh input is
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
how we got to the licensed element of it
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
so why we limited it to licensed people
 
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
the number things that we argued about
 
00:56:57.069 --> 00:56:57.079 align:start position:0%
or discussed about it that we still are
 
00:56:58.990 --> 00:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
open you know to question on their part
 
00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sure is you know the number of
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
treatments you should provide for each
 
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
of these things may versus shall you
 
00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:06.599 align:start position:0%
know that kind of thing because we had
 
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
that that was a huge discussion like
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
should this be May or shall um um um you
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
know and those are things that are in
 
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
this bill in fact I have it in there may
 
00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
or shall one's in parenthesis one's not
 
00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
because that's that's an important
 
00:57:22.589 --> 00:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
discussion Point um one of the other
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
issues is that they they claim that they
 
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
already provide these services um this
 
00:57:29.309 --> 00:57:29.319 align:start position:0%
gets and then the other little Minor
 
00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
Detail this only applies to 22% of the
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
insurance industry which is a huge
 
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
problem anyways so I just want to make
 
00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
my two cents about the May versus sh I
 
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
assume that they may do all of these
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
things right now and and as you just
 
00:57:50.589 --> 00:57:50.599 align:start position:0%
said um many of them are doing some of
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
them already so if you're going to have
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
a bill um saying that they may do it is
 
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
not actually doing anything um uh but
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
but certainly sh is is going to set
 
00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
people off and make it much more
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
difficult but um my concern is always
 
00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
that we often have bills that are
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
described as feel-good bills where we
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
say you know somebody might be doing
 
00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
something well that's great uh but
 
00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
people are either already doing them
 
00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:29.960 align:start position:0%
they they're already not so um if if if
 
00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
you're actually going to have a bill it
 
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
probably ought to be a sh that that was
 
00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
my opinion as well and I appreciate that
 
00:58:41.109 --> 00:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
statement feelgood's nice but it doesn't
 
00:58:41.119 --> 00:58:43.589 align:start position:0%
statement feelgood's nice but it doesn't
accomplish

00:58:43.589 --> 00:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
00:58:43.599 --> 00:58:47.109 align:start position:0%
accomplish
anything

00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
um talking about the insurance companies
 
00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.029 --> 00:59:01.039 align:start position:0%
develop some way is double double ways
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
there what I'm trying to think through
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
with the committee here if it's truly
 
00:59:09.029 --> 00:59:09.039 align:start position:0%
patient centered is how do we somehow
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
protect the insurance company from
 
00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:12.309 align:start position:0%
protect the insurance company from
Financial

00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
Financial
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
Risk because a lot of times it comes
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
down to is you're trying to measure
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
and monitor if you will the risk you're
 
00:59:20.829 --> 00:59:20.839 align:start position:0%
taken on financially because you have ex
 
00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
number of dollars coming in a premium
 
00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
and how you spend it out and so forth
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
you have to be cognitive of what you're
 
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
doing on the expense side instead of
 
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
trying to get into which I don't like
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
his mandates is allow either the
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
provider or the patient to have back to
 
00:59:37.309 --> 00:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
like with hospice there's some guard
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
rails Financial guard rails on it so
 
00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
that it just can't run a muck um but
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
there's also more leeway within it so
 
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
the patient at that point in time has
 
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
along with the provider has a little
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
more say in how the resources get
 
00:59:51.549 --> 00:59:51.559 align:start position:0%
utilized but the insurance companies
 
00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
protected from outside of the guard
 
00:59:57.630 --> 00:59:57.640 align:start position:0%
rails so there is some sort of way to
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
minimize the financial downside but
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
allow for the patient provider to have
 
01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:03.160 align:start position:0%
more flexibility and utilizing the
 
01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:06.559 align:start position:0%
resource themselves represent
 
01:00:06.559 --> 01:00:08.230 align:start position:0%
resource themselves represent
th

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
th
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
um so I mean most of the things that are
 
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
listed now are not hugely expensive like
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
um not that physical therapy is cheap
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
but compared to surgery it's cheap um I
 
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
guess one thing might be that and and
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
there I guess for negoti is whether it's
 
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
12 visits or whatever it's going to be
 
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
for a given thing so then the the issue
 
01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
about how it might get out of hand would
 
01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
be if you have five different options
 
01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
here does a given patient get 12
 
01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
treatments of all five different options
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
or or is there some other limit that
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
kicks in after you've tried but the flip
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
side if it's patient centered if they
 
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
tried physical therapy and that didn't
 
01:00:58.750 --> 01:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
work shouldn't they be allowed to try
 
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
acupuncture if I can answer that because
 
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
I want to just explain how we got to
 
01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:07.160 align:start position:0%
where we are so the original bill um
 
01:01:11.109 --> 01:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
actually basically said it wasn't a sky
 
01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
the limit thing but it listed a number
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
of different entities within each
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
subcategory and The Way It Was Written
 
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
is there were 20 visits not 12 and that
 
01:01:23.309 --> 01:01:23.319 align:start position:0%
person could have 20 visits of every one
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
of those things and when you did the
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
final number it was like over a hundred
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
I mean it's a lot and so you know the
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
insurers appropriately pointed out that
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
problem and and and then then the next
 
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
number question was like when I and it's
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
nothing against chiropractors when I
 
01:01:40.109 --> 01:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
first started out like you know I've
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
been here for almost 40 years but in the
 
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
beginning you know we'd have patients
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
going three times a week for decades and
 
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
and the insurers are paying for that so
 
01:01:51.029 --> 01:01:51.039 align:start position:0%
is that excessive as well the number 12
 
01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
was basically a compromise and you could
 
01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
use 12 from each of those four
 
01:01:57.309 --> 01:01:57.319 align:start position:0%
categories what's really important when
 
01:01:58.829 --> 01:01:58.839 align:start position:0%
we talk about pain is and centered
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
integrative care is my favorite example
 
01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
is that when a little kid hurts
 
01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
themselves you know Falls gets a boo boo
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
the first thing the mother does is come
 
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
gives the person a hug then kisses the
 
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
Boo Boo and then begins to do range of
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
motion they've now done three different
 
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
modalities for one acute problem and
 
01:02:20.549 --> 01:02:20.559 align:start position:0%
that's the way we treat things so that
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
you know if you know acupuncture and
 
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic together may be a good
 
01:02:26.589 --> 01:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
thing to do together and that's why it
 
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
was important that you not limit 12
 
01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
allog together you know that you could
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
do 12 of this 12 of that so they could
 
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
work together that that's where the all
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
these numbers came from why we did it
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
that way um and the 12 was a compromise
 
01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:41.559 align:start position:0%
because 20 would have been preferable
 
01:02:41.559 --> 01:02:43.190 align:start position:0%
because 20 would have been preferable
but

01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
nice one more thing U just thank you
 
01:02:58.190 --> 01:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
back to what representative Murphy
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
talked about which was the that the that
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
the um that the the insurers will Pro
 
01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:06.440 align:start position:0%
will ensure an adequate number of
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
providers I mean I mean that I guess I
 
01:03:12.829 --> 01:03:12.839 align:start position:0%
guess you would you wouldn't you would
 
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that they I'm sorry
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
you didn't get to talk I wanted to have
 
01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
you guys
 
01:03:22.109 --> 01:03:22.119 align:start position:0%
talk oh can you be convinced to stay a
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
minute thank you
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:42.079 align:start position:0%
anything I just wanted to thank you
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
kept you're
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
welcome um sorry so well just about that
 
01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
because I mean if you said um that an
 
01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
insurer will in will ensure the
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate number of primary care
 
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:02.200 align:start position:0%
providers I I'd go like Well everybody's
 
01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
trying to do that and nobody's
 
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
succeeding um so I
 
01:04:07.870 --> 01:04:07.880 align:start position:0%
just I guess I'd like a little
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
perspective on that because I guess
 
01:04:11.829 --> 01:04:11.839 align:start position:0%
there needs to be something that that
 
01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:13.880 align:start position:0%
says well we're going to pay for it but
 
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
but we don't have any any acupuncturist
 
01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:19.240 align:start position:0%
on our on our preferred list so
 
01:04:21.269 --> 01:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
essentially I don't know I'm really glad
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
you brought that up because you guys are
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
bringing up all the questions that I had
 
01:04:28.029 --> 01:04:28.039 align:start position:0%
without me having to bring them up so I
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
I personally would strike that um it was
 
01:04:33.789 --> 01:04:33.799 align:start position:0%
it was what was the uspf wanted it us P
 
01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
Foundation wanted that language in there
 
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
um in Massachusetts it may be doable in
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it's probably not um so um
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
um I I I thanks for bringing that
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chairman um oh sorry
 
01:04:51.789 --> 01:04:51.799 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy um just a couple
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
points with while it was a lull here I
 
01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure I understood should when we
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
get to shall and may I understand but
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
should threw me way
 
01:05:04.269 --> 01:05:04.279 align:start position:0%
off should you know so that was one of
 
01:05:06.109 --> 01:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
the questions I had the other one I had
 
01:05:08.269 --> 01:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
was you know if you do multimodal and
 
01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
you want to put a definition in there
 
01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
and you put synergistic or complimentary
 
01:05:15.069 --> 01:05:15.079 align:start position:0%
effect it may be good to put in their
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
alternative effect as well and the
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
reason I say that is because Behavioral
 
01:05:21.549 --> 01:05:21.559 align:start position:0%
Health interventions is entirely
 
01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
different than manual interventions so
 
01:05:27.269 --> 01:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
you know they may not be synergestic but
 
01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
they may be alternative so I just add
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
that as a suggestion not necessarily to
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
words Smith it over liso but I just add
 
01:05:35.269 --> 01:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
say that one more time like I want to
 
01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:36.440 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand what you just
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
said I I would I would add in
 
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
multimodal it talks about synergistic or
 
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
complimentary effect I would also say
 
01:05:45.390 --> 01:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
and also
 
01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
alternative got and the reason being is
 
01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
because behavioral is different than
 
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
manual therapy of different sorts you
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
guys are like the best you're waste this
 
01:05:56.589 --> 01:05:56.599 align:start position:0%
is fun so are we replacing should with
 
01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
shall or may or both shall I mean it's a
 
01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
waste of time to do this bill if it's
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
not shall right but rent Murphy where
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
where are you which page uh again I'm
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
working for um the r one the one that
 
01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
31 it's interesting because um and I and
 
01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
I I I want to um just emphasize is that
 
01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
everything that I try to do in healthc
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
care when I'm running symposiums or
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
whatever is that we always include a
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
patient at least one because last I
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
checked they're the smartest people when
 
01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
it has to do with their own body and um
 
01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
that terminology and that came from
 
01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
patients not from us so that's why
 
01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
that's important but I agree it all
 
01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
um this is a lot of information and
 
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
um I mean you've pointed out all M oh
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
sorry did you want to because I I'm
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
trying to think of like where we go from
 
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
here um this is a lot to throw at
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
everybody here at one time I I I didn't
 
01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
intend this to be a last step today
 
01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how you all feel about
 
01:07:32.109 --> 01:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
that but um um this is a lot of
 
01:07:34.029 --> 01:07:34.039 align:start position:0%
information good for stuff for me and
 
01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
it's virtually everything you brought up
 
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
is stuff that I was thought about or
 
01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:41.839 align:start position:0%
concerned about so I I can I I would
 
01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
suggest that we do go forward I'm sorry
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
that we've given you so much information
 
01:07:49.950 --> 01:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
no no it's what I want basically managed
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
um but if I had two things in my mind
 
01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
that would and I'm thinking about as
 
01:07:58.109 --> 01:07:58.119 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald mentioned you
 
01:07:59.549 --> 01:07:59.559 align:start position:0%
know if we when we get to the point
 
01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
where there'll be a vote on the floor
 
01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
someplace or in a committee somewhere
 
01:08:05.870 --> 01:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to be very important that we
 
01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
address the responsibility of the
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
provider and also their education and
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
their recertification and their
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
education that's already done and what
 
01:08:15.309 --> 01:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
they do
 
01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
already uh but also to make sure that
 
01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
the insurers are part of the equation
 
01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
and you know in my most simplistic terms
 
01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
is is that if a
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
licensed non- quack you know provider
 
01:08:35.309 --> 01:08:35.319 align:start position:0%
offers an alternative to opioids then
 
01:08:37.470 --> 01:08:37.480 align:start position:0%
the insurance coverage should be there
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it's covered that
 
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
would be my simplest and I that' be my
 
01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
one page summary document in the last
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
five days I've been called all sorts of
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
names um um yes yes and and in my
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
medical career I have been referred to
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
as a quack at times I started doing
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
epidurals in 1987 for back pain because
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
I thought it had value and I know
 
01:09:05.950 --> 01:09:05.960 align:start position:0%
prominent doctor in this state referred
 
01:09:08.669 --> 01:09:08.679 align:start position:0%
to me as a quack who 30 years later I
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
actually did an epidural on so I always
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
struggle with the definition of quack
 
01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
but yeah I get where you're going yeah
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
mostly I was saying the non- quack you
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
know that the the people that provide
 
01:09:22.349 --> 01:09:22.359 align:start position:0%
the healthcare do the appropriate thing
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
refes what and I'm just going to remind
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
every body here that this is a very
 
01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.309 align:start position:0%
every body here that this is a very
productive

01:09:29.309 --> 01:09:29.319 align:start position:0%
productive
 
01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
discussion but when we get to what we do
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
as a committee sometime between now and
 
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
October 20th the only thing we will be
 
01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
voting on is recommended for further
 
01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
action or not recommended for further
 
01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
action so if all of the word smithing is
 
01:09:47.679 --> 01:09:48.669 align:start position:0%
action so if all of the word smithing is
not

01:09:48.669 --> 01:09:48.679 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
done uh that's okay I always think it's
 
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
helpful to have sub committee meetings
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
where they're open to the public people
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
can come people can listen and um you
 
01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
know sometimes it's not pretty but it
 
01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
it's helpful in terms of input and
 
01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
openness of the process but if if the
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
words are not completely smithed by the
 
01:10:18.669 --> 01:10:18.679 align:start position:0%
time the committee meets that's fine and
 
01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
of course going forward uh the chair can
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
certainly appoint whatever ad hoc sub
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
committee the chair thinks is valuable
 
01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:29.390 align:start position:0%
committee the chair thinks is valuable
and

01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
useful um
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
always remembering that all of our
 
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
Personnel is going to change on December
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
5th so you just segwayed very nicely
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
into what I wanted to ask all of you
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
about because everybody here has more
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
experience than me but when we did our
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
prior authorization bill which I was
 
01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
told had zero chance of passing it was a
 
01:10:57.149 --> 01:10:57.159 align:start position:0%
waste of my time um and I said well it's
 
01:10:59.709 --> 01:10:59.719 align:start position:0%
important one of the things that we did
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
that I think guaranteed its
 
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
success was that we put together an ad
 
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
hoc group that included um and I think
 
01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
these are very similar issues that's why
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
I think that you can superimpose them
 
01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
but the group included this the hospital
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
Association the medical society um the
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
two sponsors which are me and Senator
 
01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
rardy uh the insurance commission
 
01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
um and the insurers and we sat down at a
 
01:11:32.229 --> 01:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
table as equals and hashed out this bill
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
what makes sense what doesn't make sense
 
01:11:36.990 --> 01:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
this needs to get done how do we do it
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
and how can everybody be as happy as
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
possible one of the the reason I wanted
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
to direct it this way at this time is I
 
01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
really think that needs to happen for
 
01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
this bill to be successful because I'll
 
01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
be honest if we eliminate the insurers
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
from the discussion this isn't going
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
anywhere and that's a waste of time and
 
01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
that process can happen in one of two
 
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
ways one of which is that uh you and
 
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
other private citizens can meet with
 
01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
anybody you want to meet with at anytime
 
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
with any without any notice to anybody
 
01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
you don't want to notice but including
 
01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
everybody you want to include and that's
 
01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
just a private meeting and that's no
 
01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
problem if it is an actual subcommittee
 
01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
as this is appointed by our chair then
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
we are subject to the right to know law
 
01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:24.440 align:start position:0%
and the notice requirements so there is
 
01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
nothing that stops a group of interested
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
people from meeting as many times as
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
they wish to meet and discussing Ways
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
and Means and seeing if they can come to
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh a consensus which then gets filed
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
with OS either in November or as a uh an
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
amendment to a bill filed in November
 
01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
thing we did do is for re strategic
 
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
reasons we actually put the bill in
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
through the Senate so that would give us
 
01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
more time anyway if we chose to do that
 
01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:55.950 align:start position:0%
more time anyway if we chose to do that
direction

01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
direction
 
01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
if I could follow on
 
01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
that if it's a private meeting at that
 
01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
point in time can that be done
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
online virtual versus being if it's a
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
private meeting it's a a meeting of
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
private citizens and they can do
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to do if if it's a
 
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
meeting that is a house meeting we have
 
01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
to do it in accordance with our house
 
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
rules and with RSA 91a so I from the
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
insurers and the audience I I think
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
Larry you were there right
 
01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
were you there at that meeting that we
 
01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
did for prior o no was oh Andrew I know
 
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
you weren't yeah I just I don't remember
 
01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure it was a noticed meeting
 
01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
but I could be wrong but it was held you
 
01:13:40.030 --> 01:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
know at the at the State House well
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
we've had we've had a number of
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
different forums uh for a uh one could
 
01:13:49.790 --> 01:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
be a statutory study committee yeah uh
 
01:13:52.629 --> 01:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
which is created in chapter law and and
 
01:13:56.189 --> 01:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
Al those often bring together
 
01:13:56.199 --> 01:13:58.229 align:start position:0%
Al those often bring together
multi-

01:13:58.229 --> 01:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
multi-
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
um many different people wearing many
 
01:14:03.790 --> 01:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
different hats this is a retained Bill
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
committee so the only people who can be
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
on the actual committee are uh house
 
01:14:11.550 --> 01:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
members but you can of course listen to
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
anybody you want to listen to um so it's
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
possible that it was any number of these
 
01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
things but there have also been any
 
01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
number of very good bills brought to us
 
01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
that have been the subject of lot of
 
01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
meetings outside of the legislative
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
process by people who are interested and
 
01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:33.080 align:start position:0%
who are stakeholders who are trying to
 
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
come up with something which has a
 
01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
chance of of getting through because
 
01:14:41.189 --> 01:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
they have sat down and discussed it uh
 
01:14:43.629 --> 01:14:43.639 align:start position:0%
carefully before they started and and so
 
01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
there's there's Merit in all of those so
 
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
um because this is what my where my oh
 
01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry represent so I have more of a
 
01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
question than anything else at this
 
01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
point and maybe the insurers can help me
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
with this as well if you have and I'm
 
01:14:59.470 --> 01:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get at the heart of the
 
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
bill which is really to as you mentioned
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:15:05.709 --> 01:15:05.719 align:start position:0%
outset as a response to the opioid
 
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
crisis that we had and we still have
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
going forward um if you have a licensed
 
01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
certified credential privileged
 
01:15:17.790 --> 01:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
provider I didn't say anything about
 
01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
quackery but if we have a provider that
 
01:15:22.709 --> 01:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
offers an alternative to
 
01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
opioids has that been
 
01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh denied by the insurance
 
01:15:30.629 --> 01:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
carriers and the reason I asked that is
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
because again it it gets to the point
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
that if I provide a service and I choose
 
01:15:38.669 --> 01:15:38.679 align:start position:0%
not to do surgery but I provide
 
01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
something I think would be very
 
01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
effective for the management of that
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
patient outside of the surgical realm or
 
01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:44.070 align:start position:0%
patient outside of the surgical realm or
the

01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
opioid uh medications have they been
 
01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
denied so the the question the reason I
 
01:15:51.870 --> 01:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
asked that question is that if you have
 
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
the right
 
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
person providing the right
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
Alternatives has that been then denied
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
by insurance carriers and therefore the
 
01:16:03.629 --> 01:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
Genesis of the problem that we have
 
01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
right now so that's why that's it's
 
01:16:08.669 --> 01:16:08.679 align:start position:0%
almost a rhetorical question but that's
 
01:16:10.629 --> 01:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
the part that I want to get at in the
 
01:16:13.709 --> 01:16:13.719 align:start position:0%
bill that should not be arguable well
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
what's been interesting historically and
 
01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
you and I have been around a while and
 
01:16:21.669 --> 01:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
um but when I first got here um you know
 
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic Care was off the charge I
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
mean all my a lot of our patients were
 
01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
going every you know couple times a week
 
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
if I remember right and um and now it's
 
01:16:34.669 --> 01:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
like Feast to famine and and that's what
 
01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of the chiropractors and that's
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
why this bill came from them um a lot of
 
01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:41.719 align:start position:0%
the other entities it's really
 
01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
interesting because the minute you
 
01:16:45.550 --> 01:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
accept Insurance you accept everything
 
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
that comes with it like prior
 
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
authorization and all the headaches and
 
01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
all that kind of stuff so a lot of the
 
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
the groups that I work with they don't
 
01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
do with a bill like this cuz they're
 
01:16:58.750 --> 01:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
very happy living feif for service at
 
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
low cost so um um but yeah I mean
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
massage isn't covered by almost any and
 
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
we know it has benefit um um
 
01:17:11.149 --> 01:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic is covered by most insures
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
but it's very limited um compared to
 
01:17:16.990 --> 01:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
what it used to be um acupuncture to me
 
01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
is almost a joke I mean like CMS
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
approved it for chronic low back pain
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
which is the one thing it's least likely
 
01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
to help I mean it you know it's like
 
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
well yeah we acupuncture no you don't
 
01:17:27.870 --> 01:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
you cover it for something that it's not
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
going to help um and CBT has always been
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
really challenging like you know mental
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
health interventions and things like
 
01:17:36.270 --> 01:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
that and we know for especially for
 
01:17:38.189 --> 01:17:38.199 align:start position:0%
chronic pain CBT has a cognitive
 
01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
behavioral therapy has a lot of value um
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
and getting access to that is really
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
hard so um and be honest it's a lot
 
01:17:47.709 --> 01:17:47.719 align:start position:0%
cheaper than a lot of these
 
01:17:47.719 --> 01:17:49.470 align:start position:0%
cheaper than a lot of these
anti-inflammatories

01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
anti-inflammatories
 
01:17:51.870 --> 01:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
are yeah yeah I wasn't even going to go
 
01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
that far so to answer your question yes
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
that was the Genesis of this is people
 
01:17:59.790 --> 01:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
don't have access to these things um you
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
know and and some of them that that was
 
01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
the one that always bothered me is like
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
I made a a deal with um an insur a long
 
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
time ago about
 
01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
acupuncture basically the only patients
 
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
that they allowed me to treat were
 
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
people that exhausted everything first
 
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
and I said the most like the patient I
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
most likely to help is the patient I see
 
01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
before it begins to be a problem not way
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
down the road you basically just
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
you know guaranteed that I'm not going
 
01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
to help any of your patients and and
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
then you're going to conclude I'm
 
01:18:33.070 --> 01:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
useless when if I had done it here not
 
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
there and that that was the other thing
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
is timing is critical it's you know you
 
01:18:39.149 --> 01:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
don't want to do these things it's like
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
anything you don't want to do it too
 
01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
late you want to do it earlier so so
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
timing is important and access is
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
important well I'm glad you brought the
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
point about timing because you know you
 
01:18:51.709 --> 01:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
get into a chronic pain
 
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
situation and no matter what you do for
 
01:18:54.910 --> 01:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
that patient it's not going to be
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
helpful whereas if you were to take care
 
01:18:58.270 --> 01:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
of that problem right from the get-go
 
01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
with the appropriate therapy that may be
 
01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
very helpful and that includes you know
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
therapy it's interesting because if the
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
national pain strategy was one of the
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
greatest documents ever produced by the
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
federal government that never led to
 
01:19:14.110 --> 01:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
anything and it it's not that but
 
01:19:16.270 --> 01:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
basically what is they put together was
 
01:19:18.189 --> 01:19:18.199 align:start position:0%
a group and I was kind of involved in it
 
01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
but you know we came up with six pillars
 
01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:23.560 align:start position:0%
of pain strategy that we needed to get
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
on one is early
 
01:19:28.629 --> 01:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
um um you know was timing with and
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
prevention prevention of chronic pain
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
before it starts and if you don't have
 
01:19:35.709 --> 01:19:35.719 align:start position:0%
access to these things earlier then you
 
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
may have a higher instance of chronic
 
01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
pain which means that you're going to be
 
01:19:42.149 --> 01:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
stuck with very costly things forever so
 
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
prevention is important but it's the one
 
01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
thing that very difficult to prove it's
 
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
successful and at the same point um you
 
01:19:52.030 --> 01:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
know even in virtually every element of
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
our health care System prevention is the
 
01:19:58.270 --> 01:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
one thing we do rotten so um anyways
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
this is funny I get to babble about
 
01:20:01.950 --> 01:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
stuff I hate to say this as a surgeon
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
but I would say that um you know what
 
01:20:07.950 --> 01:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
we've come to realize is that often
 
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
times the the things that we are most
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
likely to benefit from substantially
 
01:20:18.110 --> 01:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
Education Health care whatever your
 
01:20:20.350 --> 01:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
beliefs are about climate change Etc if
 
01:20:22.709 --> 01:20:22.719 align:start position:0%
you do those today yeah they have
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
significant impact not 5 years are now
 
01:20:26.830 --> 01:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
in the election cycle or four years or 2
 
01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
years but 30 years down the road the
 
01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
same thing with Healthcare you know so
 
01:20:33.910 --> 01:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
if you provide that Health Care early on
 
01:20:35.950 --> 01:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
the insurers would actually see a
 
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
benefit financially as
 
01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
well I yeah
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
totally so I guess represent lber I just
 
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
had one more drafting thing if I may go
 
01:20:52.629 --> 01:20:52.639 align:start position:0%
off the board because I I was rooting
 
01:20:54.189 --> 01:20:54.199 align:start position:0%
around in the statute trying to figure
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
out why we needed to do this twice and
 
01:20:57.990 --> 01:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
the answer is one is individual and one
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
is group exactly um but I I do have one
 
01:21:04.870 --> 01:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
further suggestion which is that in
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
normal statutory drafting you put your
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
definitions at the top rather than the
 
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
bottom so um when when somebody actually
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
gets to the point of drafting something
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
for OS you might make sure that that
 
01:21:20.189 --> 01:21:20.199 align:start position:0%
goes at the top rather than the bottom
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
and then uh I leave to them remembering
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
which is a section and which is a
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph in which is a subdivision and
 
01:21:28.189 --> 01:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
all the rest of that they'll work that
 
01:21:31.390 --> 01:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
out for you but uh putting it at the top
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
is is helpful in terms of understanding
 
01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
what comes behind and it's where people
 
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
will look for it so I have a pragmatic
 
01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
question that's kind of related to that
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
so this is what I in in if this wasn't a
 
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
legislative meeting what I would do at
 
01:21:46.990 --> 01:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
this point would say you know what we've
 
01:21:48.669 --> 01:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
discussed this we've given this to you
 
01:21:50.110 --> 01:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
can you look through the draft tell me
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
what you think changes need to be made
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
I'll make the changes and then we meet
 
01:21:56.189 --> 01:21:56.199 align:start position:0%
again to go over that make sure I got it
 
01:21:59.070 --> 01:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
right and or we have it right and then
 
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
then cuz I have to submit a report I
 
01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
think in October 20th before October
 
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
25th yeah so we have time but I was just
 
01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
thinking we could meet one more time um
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
and then come up with a strategy um but
 
01:22:15.550 --> 01:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
but I I would it might be helpful if
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
people could do that and then then I'll
 
01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
try to take there's somebody here from
 
01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
OS that can correct me if I'm wrong but
 
01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
my understanding is you're perfect ly
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
okay with the right to no law for
 
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
everybody to send you their thoughts and
 
01:22:34.030 --> 01:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
you can put them into a draft you need
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
to then not discuss it back and forth
 
01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
between everybody on the subcommittee
 
01:22:41.950 --> 01:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
until you get to your new meeting so uh
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
everybody can send you their thoughts
 
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
and uh you can consolidate them and you
 
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
can certainly send that out saying here
 
01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
in preparation for our meeting on
 
01:22:55.229 --> 01:22:55.239 align:start position:0%
Thursday is a draft that incl everything
 
01:22:57.990 --> 01:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
I've been sent but then you have to
 
01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
refrain from saying oh and we're all
 
01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
going to as a group right discuss it
 
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
back and forth which is entirely
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive and one of the toughest
 
01:23:11.229 --> 01:23:11.239 align:start position:0%
things for new legislators to learn
 
01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
because it's how we all work outside of
 
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
the legislative process so if we could
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
do that I would appreciate that but I
 
01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:21.639 align:start position:0%
would like to I I mean I don't we have
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
more time but I would like to schedule
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
you know another meeting to perhaps
 
01:23:31.629 --> 01:23:31.639 align:start position:0%
finalize that and get next steps um
 
01:23:34.750 --> 01:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
um I have another question on pragmatics
 
01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
so um because I I know when we tried to
 
01:23:42.510 --> 01:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
do an ad hoc thing with HB 66 we were
 
01:23:44.189 --> 01:23:44.199 align:start position:0%
told that if there were more than so
 
01:23:46.350 --> 01:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
many members of the committee present
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
that it would be functioning illegal
 
01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:49.390 align:start position:0%
that it would be functioning illegal
meeting

01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
um so in other words if I we put
 
01:23:53.709 --> 01:23:53.719 align:start position:0%
together an ad hoc meeting with insurers
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
and whomever um um you know all
 
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholders they all have to be less
 
01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
than a quarum right of a legislative
 
01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
body and so human services so if it's
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Services
 
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
committee you can have uh you have to
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
have 10 or less oh we and and but if
 
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
you're 10 or under you're home free
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
because it's a 20 member committee oh
 
01:24:24.030 --> 01:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
that be and a quorum would be 11 so
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
you're you're golden so we should okay
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
so can so this is what I would like to
 
01:24:30.750 --> 01:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
do going forward if everybody can give
 
01:24:33.790 --> 01:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
me their feedback on what they saw um
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing up that wrong
 
01:24:38.350 --> 01:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
thing about chiong and whatever um that
 
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
was helpful and then we'll make a note
 
01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
I'll go over this entire document and
 
01:24:46.149 --> 01:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
then we're having a house meeting on the
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
10th right and that's more than two
 
01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
weeks away what day is today I mean
 
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
could we meet in like two weeks to um to
 
01:24:57.229 --> 01:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
finalize that and then next
 
01:24:59.870 --> 01:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
steps well Mr chairman you were thinking
 
01:25:04.270 --> 01:25:04.280 align:start position:0%
about having our committee meeting as
 
01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
opposed to any other meeting uh sometime
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
the 8th or the
 
01:25:11.109 --> 01:25:11.119 align:start position:0%
9th which would be the committee meeting
 
01:25:13.629 --> 01:25:13.639 align:start position:0%
at which we vote either to recommend for
 
01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
future legislation or not recommend for
 
01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
future legislation but we can do that in
 
01:25:22.669 --> 01:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
the absence of actual wording because
 
01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
that committee doesn't doesn't vote on
 
01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
the wording they just vote on the
 
01:25:28.109 --> 01:25:28.119 align:start position:0%
concept so here's a motion oh go ahead
 
01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah to representative Weber's
 
01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
Point chin I were discussing
 
01:25:35.229 --> 01:25:35.239 align:start position:0%
earlier I believe it's 13 interim study
 
01:25:37.629 --> 01:25:37.639 align:start position:0%
bills and we need to get them out before
 
01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
October 25th we're thinking having a
 
01:25:43.950 --> 01:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
work session and an executive session um
 
01:25:47.229 --> 01:25:47.239 align:start position:0%
on you know the two days before uh veto
 
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
day which is October 10th and um you
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
know trying to dispose of all of those
 
01:25:55.390 --> 01:25:55.400 align:start position:0%
okay so um but if talking two weeks out
 
01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
from today that would still be September
 
01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
that'd be like the 27th or something um
 
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
two weeks from today is the 26 26 26
 
01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:06.629 align:start position:0%
two weeks from today is the 26 26 26
so

01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:06.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:10.109 --> 01:26:10.119 align:start position:0%
uh do we is there a date that has been
 
01:26:12.510 --> 01:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
select between October 8th and October
 
01:26:15.910 --> 01:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
9th well we're looking at October 8th um
 
01:26:18.189 --> 01:26:18.199 align:start position:0%
if that works for for the members of the
 
01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
committee it's a little bit off topic
 
01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
for 554 but um if October 88th works so
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
you folks no representative King it
 
01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:28.709 align:start position:0%
you folks no representative King it
doesn't

01:26:28.709 --> 01:26:28.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
work I have a conference both the 8th
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
and the 9th oh okay I'm working that
 
01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
week so that
 
01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:39.310 align:start position:0%
week so that
not

01:26:39.310 --> 01:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
okay I'll be out of town I I'll be back
 
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
on the 9th I can't do the e but I can do
 
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
the actually
 
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
no I'll be I'm like representative King
 
01:26:52.189 --> 01:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
I'll be out of town that
 
01:26:54.669 --> 01:26:54.679 align:start position:0%
week and again it's it's not going to be
 
01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
like normal executive session it's not
 
01:26:58.510 --> 01:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
going to you know the bill isn't going
 
01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
to go to the floor or anything so it's
 
01:27:02.950 --> 01:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
it's not a huge I'm not saying it's un
 
01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
important but it's not as as Paramount
 
01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
as as other executive sessions would be
 
01:27:11.070 --> 01:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
because we either recommend for future
 
01:27:13.709 --> 01:27:13.719 align:start position:0%
legislation or not and even if we don't
 
01:27:15.510 --> 01:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
recommend they can still be brought up
 
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
so so all right so I guess we may have
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
to go to the ninth from what I'm hearing
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
01:27:25.629 --> 01:27:25.639 align:start position:0%
know and and again we can adjourn by
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
three and call another meeting you know
 
01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
following week who because I I I am
 
01:27:32.430 --> 01:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
respectful of the fact you have another
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
meeting at 3 so so even though I'm not
 
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
invited to
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
it so it's safe to assume I don't want
 
01:27:43.149 --> 01:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
to assume I'm not going to assume um are
 
01:27:45.790 --> 01:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
we in agreement that something will come
 
01:27:47.790 --> 01:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
out of this
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
legislatively yes all right so um I mean
 
01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:54.280 align:start position:0%
that's all you needed to know correct
 
01:27:57.470 --> 01:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
from us well as I understand it um the
 
01:27:59.709 --> 01:27:59.719 align:start position:0%
interim study committee report uh and
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
that does need to be one even if it's as
 
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
simple to say not recommended for future
 
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
legislation the more we can put into
 
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
that the more of a head start it gives
 
01:28:10.669 --> 01:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
the the bill next time okay and given
 
01:28:12.109 --> 01:28:12.119 align:start position:0%
the challenges and I don't know the
 
01:28:14.350 --> 01:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
history of this bill as well as some of
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
you do but sounds like it's faced a lot
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
of challenges in previous efforts and
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
the more of a head start we can give the
 
01:28:24.669 --> 01:28:24.679 align:start position:0%
bill next time in the next session Yeah
 
01:28:26.470 --> 01:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
the more likely it will'll have success
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
so to answer more we can put into that
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
in study report for the next okay and
 
01:28:33.790 --> 01:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
the next effort I think the more the
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
better it'll be to get it some of um
 
01:28:38.669 --> 01:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
represented Merchants concerns earlier
 
01:28:41.070 --> 01:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
on there was virtually the original Bill
 
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
had virtually no stakeholder support
 
01:28:45.709 --> 01:28:45.719 align:start position:0%
even the groups that it was designed to
 
01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:48.639 align:start position:0%
help didn't support it and so that was
 
01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
the Genesis of 303 was to actually well
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
how do we actually get stakeholder
 
01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:54.590 align:start position:0%
how do we actually get stakeholder
support

01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
and so um how would that been in other
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
states we have virtually no other state
 
01:29:02.189 --> 01:29:02.199 align:start position:0%
model to go by except Massachusetts and
 
01:29:05.790 --> 01:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
the outcome of that wasn't that great so
 
01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
um we tried all along to include the
 
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:12.280 align:start position:0%
insurers in the in the discussions um so
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
you know and I understand their concerns
 
01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
I get it totally um um but that was the
 
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
Genesis what we got in front of us now
 
01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:22.280 align:start position:0%
is this is what we had got stakeholder
 
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
support for so virtually every
 
01:29:26.109 --> 01:29:26.119 align:start position:0%
stakeholder supports what we're
 
01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
proposing except maybe the insurers and
 
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
so the next question is like how can we
 
01:29:34.910 --> 01:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
work with them and and I also with that
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
said you know we're you know this is my
 
01:29:40.350 --> 01:29:40.360 align:start position:0%
world this is the way I think but every
 
01:29:43.149 --> 01:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
insurer in this state is you're the best
 
01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:44.920 align:start position:0%
people on the planet you guys are wicked
 
01:29:47.310 --> 01:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
awesome you're the best people ever
 
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
we're not necessarily legislating for
 
01:29:51.709 --> 01:29:51.719 align:start position:0%
you but we're NE we are legislating for
 
01:29:53.830 --> 01:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
other insurers that may migrate into the
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
state date and as I think um and again I
 
01:29:58.830 --> 01:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
I will reiterate what I've said before
 
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
is that there's a concerning Trend that
 
01:30:04.109 --> 01:30:04.119 align:start position:0%
in the next 5 to 10 years there will be
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
four to five providers of Health Care
 
01:30:08.910 --> 01:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
and four to five insurers for the entire
 
01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
country and if we don't get control of
 
01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:13.030 align:start position:0%
country and if we don't get control of
that

01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
now they will dictate to us when they
 
01:30:18.430 --> 01:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
get here and and and that's really
 
01:30:20.669 --> 01:30:20.679 align:start position:0%
important to me because I mean the death
 
01:30:22.830 --> 01:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
of Private Practice is the absolute
 
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
worst thing that's happened to healthare
 
01:30:28.629 --> 01:30:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
opinion I just also want to plant the
 
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:34.639 align:start position:0%
seed in people's minds that it's very
 
01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
likely that a newly drafted bill will go
 
01:30:41.229 --> 01:30:41.239 align:start position:0%
to Commerce yeah rather than to Health
 
01:30:43.709 --> 01:30:43.719 align:start position:0%
and Human Services because they do the
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
insurance pieces so as you are
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
considering who to talk to Talking to
 
01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
folks on the Commerce Committee and
 
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
making sure that they are involved in
 
01:30:58.709 --> 01:30:58.719 align:start position:0%
the process is going to be key to
 
01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
success I actually already reached out
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
to some certain person that you know who
 
01:31:06.430 --> 01:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about um to talk about it we
 
01:31:08.590 --> 01:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
apparent did not connect I think this
 
01:31:10.350 --> 01:31:10.360 align:start position:0%
little thing called an election probably
 
01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
got in the way but but yeah I did reach
 
01:31:16.510 --> 01:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
out to him to talk to him about it um um
 
01:31:18.669 --> 01:31:18.679 align:start position:0%
and I think he would applaud the the
 
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
concept of trying to bring everybody
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
together to do this CU it won't work
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
otherwise I'm not sure who the
 
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
individual is but if the same one I'm
 
01:31:27.629 --> 01:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
thinking of I'm sorry it's
 
01:31:30.189 --> 01:31:30.199 align:start position:0%
representative hunt I should be compl OB
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
I suspected as much he hasn't been too
 
01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to this bill previously but
 
01:31:37.109 --> 01:31:37.119 align:start position:0%
making inroads that's great for whatever
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
it's worth I wasn't either but I saw the
 
01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
Merit in the concept but the bill itself
 
01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
was great greatly flawed and so you know
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
when I found out the chiropractors and
 
01:31:49.550 --> 01:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
support it either is like oh my God so
 
01:31:51.149 --> 01:31:51.159 align:start position:0%
like all right it's a good concept how
 
01:31:52.990 --> 01:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
do we fix it so then I just brought in
 
01:31:55.229 --> 01:31:55.239 align:start position:0%
people wasart than me and we just sat
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
down and tried to figure out how to make
 
01:31:58.470 --> 01:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
it better and it still was greatly
 
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
flawed so um but I think what you got in
 
01:32:04.950 --> 01:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
front of you is better than what we had
 
01:32:09.310 --> 01:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:11.550 --> 01:32:11.560 align:start position:0%
work again the simpler the more
 
01:32:15.390 --> 01:32:15.400 align:start position:0%
straightforward the better I think so a
 
01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
37 oh yeah a 39 page cannabis bill is
 
01:32:21.070 --> 01:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
that's too short
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
right we got when when we were p passed
 
01:32:27.629 --> 01:32:27.639 align:start position:0%
our prior authorization Bill the CMS U
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
proposed the reforms within 3 days of us
 
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
going to the Senate and our bill was
 
01:32:36.270 --> 01:32:36.280 align:start position:0%
about six pages long their reform
 
01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
package was 850 pages long so um and I
 
01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
thought eight pages was too
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:53.550 --> 01:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
questions this was wonderful um I never
 
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
asked asked anybody from the public for
 
01:33:00.669 --> 01:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
add I don't have anything to say I just
 
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
wanted the definition of chronic pain
 
01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
yep and how about the last four words
 
01:33:09.109 --> 01:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
lasting more than three months we got
 
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
rid of that yeah I mean the reason why
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
was we're not just talking about chronic
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
pain so we're talking about pain in
 
01:33:18.270 --> 01:33:18.280 align:start position:0%
general because you know all these
 
01:33:20.189 --> 01:33:20.199 align:start position:0%
modalities can be used at any part of
 
01:33:23.229 --> 01:33:23.239 align:start position:0%
the treatment process so it didn't seem
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
to make sense sense to me to
 
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
differentiate for the purposes of this
 
01:33:29.790 --> 01:33:29.800 align:start position:0%
bill the other work we're doing as you
 
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
know um that you're very involved and we
 
01:33:39.709 --> 01:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
differentiation I think unless anybody
 
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
has anything else represent Merchant is
 
01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
it possible to receive
 
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
a document that is not red and black but
 
01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
just black so I can look at
 
01:33:55.790 --> 01:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
try to get confused between what I'm
 
01:33:57.709 --> 01:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
trying to ignore and what I'm supposed
 
01:34:00.109 --> 01:34:00.119 align:start position:0%
to pay attention to help me immensely
 
01:34:03.229 --> 01:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
thank you how about this now that I know
 
01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
all of you are involved I will send a a
 
01:34:09.229 --> 01:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
unredacted copy to all of
 
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
you I'll apologize for having gate
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
crashed because no it was you were
 
01:34:14.159 --> 01:34:15.109 align:start position:0%
crashed because no it was you were
really

01:34:15.109 --> 01:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
helpful yeah no nobody should ever
 
01:34:21.870 --> 01:34:21.880 align:start position:0%
apologize I mean representative King was
 
01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
probably the most helpful cuz I kept
 
01:34:25.950 --> 01:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
looking at she was going hm what's he
 
01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
thinking and like oh my God Mr chairman
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
so the copy that you're going to be
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
sending out next will be all black but
 
01:34:35.629 --> 01:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
all the redacted stuff won't be in there
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
at all right correct okay unless you hit
 
01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
markup I guess right send something that
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
is drafted the way legislative services
 
01:34:46.669 --> 01:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
does it start with the language that's
 
01:34:48.910 --> 01:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
there in the statute cross out anything
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
that's in the statute that you don't
 
01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
want to continue on okay but how about
 
01:34:57.229 --> 01:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
if I send you two separate copies one
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
that's totally as you requested and then
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's up to you I mean it just I
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
think for a lot of people they're used
 
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
to reading the way os does it yeah and
 
01:35:09.229 --> 01:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
they start with the statute they cross
 
01:35:12.669 --> 01:35:12.679 align:start position:0%
out anything that's going yeah and then
 
01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
anything that's new is bold and vitalic
 
01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
and that way you can see what is
 
01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
completely new and the thing that's
 
01:35:24.430 --> 01:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
always complicated that is if it's a
 
01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
whole section that's staying that it
 
01:35:28.510 --> 01:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
stays in in regular print you don't
 
01:35:30.990 --> 01:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
realize that it isn't new until somebody
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
tells you but um it's just easier that
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
because what I sent you and I'm not
 
01:35:39.189 --> 01:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
going to rear organize like you said
 
01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
definitions I'm just going to leave it
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
where it is for now but um but yeah that
 
01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
is what I sent you was what I wanted to
 
01:35:46.750 --> 01:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
leave and what I wanted to
 
01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
stay language that you want and leave
 
01:35:51.790 --> 01:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
somebody else to deal with statuto stuff
 
01:35:53.709 --> 01:35:53.719 align:start position:0%
and just so we emphasize it's not a me
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
thing this bill was actually worked on
 
01:35:59.310 --> 01:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
by about seven or eight people you know
 
01:36:01.149 --> 01:36:01.159 align:start position:0%
who do this work locally regionally and
 
01:36:03.910 --> 01:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
nationally so this this wasn't just a me
 
01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
striking this or striking that we we did
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
it as a group so and this was an adock
 
01:36:12.270 --> 01:36:12.280 align:start position:0%
group and this was done like at least
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
three three or four years ago so it
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't recent but because this bill is
 
01:36:19.470 --> 01:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
this is Bill the same exact bill was
 
01:36:22.629 --> 01:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
presented three different times so my
 
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing so clear about this
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
I'll receive
 
01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
a document you'll take all the stuff out
 
01:36:34.109 --> 01:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
as redacted if you areu that just stri
 
01:36:36.270 --> 01:36:36.280 align:start position:0%
stricken Y and all I'll have at that
 
01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:38.360 align:start position:0%
point in time is a clean document I do
 
01:36:39.390 --> 01:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
understand where represent where is
 
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
coming from but once we're trying to get
 
01:36:43.950 --> 01:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
back our comments you're going to colate
 
01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
all those comments eventually and they
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
we'll come back and talk about the
 
01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
comments collectively is that where
 
01:36:51.390 --> 01:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
we're going sequentially and then once
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
that's done that will go on to OS and
 
01:36:55.390 --> 01:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
they'll take the document and go through
 
01:36:57.390 --> 01:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
the process to strike out what's being
 
01:36:59.750 --> 01:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
removed out of the law and then bold
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
italic size if you will that's being
 
01:37:03.229 --> 01:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
added so is that the sequence I'm trying
 
01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
to get through well the OS might be like
 
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
a step further at this point but I would
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need to worry about OS
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
at this point exactly exactly you'll
 
01:37:15.550 --> 01:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
have to worry about OS November During
 
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
the period from the day after the
 
01:37:20.149 --> 01:37:20.159 align:start position:0%
election when things open to whatever
 
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
the date is that it closes cuz that is
 
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
our only window of op opportunity in the
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
house there is a larger window of
 
01:37:29.070 --> 01:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity in the Senate and that may
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
be the reason for doing it through the
 
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
Senate but you can't just say in January
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to go to the rules committee
 
01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
and have them bring it in because uh the
 
01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
rules committee has always said if you
 
01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
knew you could have brought it in in
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
November and didn't sorry wait for next
 
01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
year so so just to get even farther with
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
that I mean the purpose of this inter
 
01:37:55.589 --> 01:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
study committee was basically to say
 
01:37:58.030 --> 01:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
this bill has value we're going forward
 
01:37:59.950 --> 01:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
the next step is one of us has to write
 
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
a bill and that'll probably be me or
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
David or whomever representative L Gren
 
01:38:07.229 --> 01:38:07.239 align:start position:0%
or whomever but like um I'm just there's
 
01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
a space there is just going through the
 
01:38:10.709 --> 01:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
house side of the Senate side I I
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
haven't decided that yet um I can see
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
good reasons to go both way either way
 
01:38:19.589 --> 01:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
um um I actually reached out to a
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
senator friend to talk about this today
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
too sing Senator B so we made chairman
 
01:38:26.430 --> 01:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
of HHS we may want to bring her in then
 
01:38:28.270 --> 01:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
that that's exactly the direction I was
 
01:38:31.229 --> 01:38:31.239 align:start position:0%
thinking of going partially one of the
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
reasons why I mean it was so much easier
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
to do like when you guys weren't there
 
01:38:39.229 --> 01:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
but like the you were there right Heidi
 
01:38:41.030 --> 01:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
when we did the thing on the prior Roth
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
we had that yeah the big meeting because
 
01:38:46.270 --> 01:38:46.280 align:start position:0%
I thought that was helpful right so um
 
01:38:47.470 --> 01:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
because that's I don't know if you were
 
01:38:48.990 --> 01:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
here when I said that but that's what I
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to do with this and um but to do
 
01:38:55.990 --> 01:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
it through the Senate it like you know I
 
01:38:57.790 --> 01:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
mean Senator rardy just told her
 
01:38:58.990 --> 01:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
secretary and the whole thing was
 
01:39:01.390 --> 01:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
arranged you know I mean it was just
 
01:39:04.189 --> 01:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
pragmatically a lot easier and and then
 
01:39:06.990 --> 01:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
the committee it got assigned to was a
 
01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
lot more proactive and we were able to
 
01:39:11.790 --> 01:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
make amendments to the bill that you
 
01:39:13.589 --> 01:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
know in the process that allowed us to
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
get it through the house because I think
 
01:39:16.709 --> 01:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
if we goone out the house first it would
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
have died so and in the end I think
 
01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
everybody's better off so I might do it
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
that way
 
01:39:26.470 --> 01:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
not so all we need to yep
 
01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:36.189 align:start position:0%
not so all we need to yep
yeah

01:39:36.189 --> 01:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:36.199 --> 01:39:37.830 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:39:46.669 --> 01:39:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
twins because if on
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
1:00 not 1:00 I have
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:52.229 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:52.239 align:start position:0%

all all right
 
03:05:13.479 --> 03:05:15.229 align:start position:0%
all all right
thanks

03:05:15.229 --> 03:05:15.239 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
03:05:19.630 --> 03:05:19.640 align:start position:0%
so so um I I do believe on the table
 
03:05:23.990 --> 03:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
there was a uh a copy of the agenda and
 
03:05:27.269 --> 03:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
basically um this is just a rough
 
03:05:29.269 --> 03:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
guideline of some questions that I had
 
03:05:32.349 --> 03:05:32.359 align:start position:0%
in my mind over the summer um our our
 
03:05:34.030 --> 03:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
former committee researcher did some
 
03:05:36.830 --> 03:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
research so I would kind of like to
 
03:05:39.670 --> 03:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
begin the hearing kind of going through
 
03:05:41.670 --> 03:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
um and you know and soliciting any
 
03:05:44.269 --> 03:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
feedback uh from uh members of the
 
03:05:47.269 --> 03:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
committee or any of you folks um if you
 
03:05:48.750 --> 03:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
would like to you know kind of make
 
03:05:51.429 --> 03:05:51.439 align:start position:0%
comment on uh what we're doing in in
 
03:05:54.150 --> 03:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
other states and and and how we kind of
 
03:05:55.429 --> 03:05:55.439 align:start position:0%
compare here
 
03:05:59.550 --> 03:05:59.560 align:start position:0%
also you can feel free uh when we met in
 
03:06:02.630 --> 03:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
June everybody just kind of moved up to
 
03:06:04.070 --> 03:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
to the main table if you think you're
 
03:06:05.910 --> 03:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
going to have a lot to offer rather than
 
03:06:08.469 --> 03:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
having everybody just coming up to to to
 
03:06:11.630 --> 03:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
the witness box as it were um if if we
 
03:06:14.030 --> 03:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
get into a discussion feel free to to
 
03:06:16.389 --> 03:06:16.399 align:start position:0%
migrate up and and and fill in the empty
 
03:06:18.670 --> 03:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
seats just so that we can kind of keep
 
03:06:21.950 --> 03:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
things moving um we are going to lose
 
03:06:25.349 --> 03:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
representative Weber relatively early so
 
03:06:28.389 --> 03:06:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh what I want to do is kind of get in
 
03:06:31.910 --> 03:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
right away into looking at some of the
 
03:06:35.070 --> 03:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
work that the uh Community researcher
 
03:06:39.110 --> 03:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
did and uh with with some difference to
 
03:06:41.030 --> 03:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
getting some of her questions answered
 
03:06:43.990 --> 03:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
before she has to leave so yes
 
03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:45.030 align:start position:0%
before she has to leave so yes
representative

03:06:45.030 --> 03:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:06:49.030 --> 03:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
King uh before we go too far I my main
 
03:06:52.190 --> 03:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
question is what's the purpose of this
 
03:06:54.830 --> 03:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
bill I I believe the background behind
 
03:06:57.550 --> 03:06:57.560 align:start position:0%
this was that somebody had abused a
 
03:07:03.990 --> 03:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
client at a a an agency or not an agency
 
03:07:09.190 --> 03:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
but uh a reform house or whatever um and
 
03:07:12.710 --> 03:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying to do what to uh
 
03:07:15.710 --> 03:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
alleviate that in the future so my
 
03:07:17.590 --> 03:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
understanding uh from the testimony and
 
03:07:20.550 --> 03:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
from what we talked about uh when we had
 
03:07:22.910 --> 03:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
the the initial meeting in the fall and
 
03:07:24.630 --> 03:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
everybody else can feel free to speak up
 
03:07:27.670 --> 03:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of issues certainly um
 
03:07:28.990 --> 03:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was offered in
 
03:07:32.309 --> 03:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
testimony was they brought up the nhpr
 
03:07:35.750 --> 03:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh podcast the 13 steps where there was
 
03:07:38.309 --> 03:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
an abuse of of somebody that was going
 
03:07:42.429 --> 03:07:42.439 align:start position:0%
in for treatment and so you know what
 
03:07:45.910 --> 03:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
can we do to to mitigate that but in
 
03:07:48.630 --> 03:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
addition to that um
 
03:07:51.110 --> 03:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
also when when people come and they're
 
03:07:53.630 --> 03:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
going to get treatment how effective is
 
03:07:57.229 --> 03:07:57.239 align:start position:0%
the actual treatment itself so this was
 
03:08:00.630 --> 03:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
not just uh I don't believe to look at
 
03:08:03.150 --> 03:08:03.160 align:start position:0%
addressing the abuse issue but also
 
03:08:05.349 --> 03:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
making sure that when you have an
 
03:08:07.590 --> 03:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get somebody into
 
03:08:10.190 --> 03:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
treatment that you know we we put some
 
03:08:12.389 --> 03:08:12.399 align:start position:0%
guidelines in place that that treatment
 
03:08:16.030 --> 03:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
is going to be as effective as possible
 
03:08:17.590 --> 03:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
some of the feedback that we got from
 
03:08:21.790 --> 03:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
folks in HHS as well is you know they're
 
03:08:24.229 --> 03:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
trying to kind of understand the
 
03:08:26.870 --> 03:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
landscape of of substance abuse
 
03:08:30.030 --> 03:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
treatment and so um it's my
 
03:08:33.150 --> 03:08:33.160 align:start position:0%
understanding that if the facility is uh
 
03:08:35.269 --> 03:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
getting Medicare or Medicaid then
 
03:08:36.630 --> 03:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
they're they're kind of bound by that
 
03:08:38.150 --> 03:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
rules they're registered by the
 
03:08:40.469 --> 03:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
department but you know if you're a
 
03:08:46.190 --> 03:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
nonprofit or a for-profit and you are uh
 
03:08:48.309 --> 03:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
basically not taking Medicade then
 
03:08:50.469 --> 03:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
you're kind of off the radar so there
 
03:08:52.990 --> 03:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
were a couple of different irons in the
 
03:08:55.590 --> 03:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
fire that that that this bill was trying
 
03:08:58.630 --> 03:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
to to get to so anybody else have any
 
03:08:59.830 --> 03:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
additional thoughts on that
 
03:08:59.840 --> 03:09:01.349 align:start position:0%
additional thoughts on that
representative

03:09:01.349 --> 03:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:09:04.150 --> 03:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
Weber well I'll defer to representative
 
03:09:06.630 --> 03:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
Shapiro on this because he's one of the
 
03:09:13.309 --> 03:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:18.110 --> 03:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
potential uh revisions that we had um in
 
03:09:20.190 --> 03:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
in the copy of the bill that you handed
 
03:09:23.510 --> 03:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
out to us I believe limited the
 
03:09:26.030 --> 03:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
facilities to outpatient facilities
 
03:09:28.910 --> 03:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
because we found in committee that there
 
03:09:31.030 --> 03:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
were so many different kinds of
 
03:09:33.550 --> 03:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
facilities that it
 
03:09:37.870 --> 03:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
was it's not a one-sized fits-all in any
 
03:09:41.429 --> 03:09:41.439 align:start position:0%
case and I think that my recollection is
 
03:09:45.910 --> 03:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
that what the committee then hung up on
 
03:09:50.309 --> 03:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
was the issue that that uh folks
 
03:09:53.550 --> 03:09:53.560 align:start position:0%
practitioners who are providing services
 
03:09:56.389 --> 03:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
are licensed or certified to do whatever
 
03:09:59.590 --> 03:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
it is that they are doing for a service
 
03:10:01.790 --> 03:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
and the question among committee members
 
03:10:03.389 --> 03:10:03.399 align:start position:0%
and I'm remembering this coming
 
03:10:05.030 --> 03:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
particularly from representative
 
03:10:08.269 --> 03:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
Merchant was as long as the providers
 
03:10:08.279 --> 03:10:09.269 align:start position:0%
Merchant was as long as the providers
are

03:10:09.269 --> 03:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:10:12.550 --> 03:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
certified why is it necessary to certify
 
03:10:16.750 --> 03:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
the facility as well and the committee
 
03:10:20.950 --> 03:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
is a committee had to plow old ground
 
03:10:24.710 --> 03:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
had reviewed the issue of sober homes in
 
03:10:31.950 --> 03:10:31.960 align:start position:0%
the context of um them being places that
 
03:10:34.710 --> 03:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
were unregulated and therefore that that
 
03:10:36.910 --> 03:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
was brought to us as a concern by the
 
03:10:40.550 --> 03:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
Fire EMS folks that the conditions in
 
03:10:42.910 --> 03:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
which people were living were simply
 
03:10:45.910 --> 03:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
unsafe uh but I think that there is
 
03:10:45.920 --> 03:10:48.429 align:start position:0%
unsafe uh but I think that there is
concern

03:10:48.429 --> 03:10:48.439 align:start position:0%
concern
 
03:10:51.309 --> 03:10:51.319 align:start position:0%
that facilities that are completely
 
03:10:54.030 --> 03:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
unregulated may not be dealing with
 
03:10:55.870 --> 03:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
people in an appropriate Manner and I
 
03:10:58.510 --> 03:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
think the question for us or for me at
 
03:11:02.469 --> 03:11:02.479 align:start position:0%
least um is if it's an
 
03:11:05.349 --> 03:11:05.359 align:start position:0%
outpatient facility where people are
 
03:11:08.030 --> 03:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
seeing licensed
 
03:11:10.190 --> 03:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
practitioners I am a lot more
 
03:11:12.910 --> 03:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable not having a certification
 
03:11:16.389 --> 03:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
on the actual facility than I would be
 
03:11:20.349 --> 03:11:20.359 align:start position:0%
if people were living there but um I
 
03:11:22.670 --> 03:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
think one of the things that the um
 
03:11:25.590 --> 03:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
hearings pointed up was the depths of my
 
03:11:29.710 --> 03:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
ignorance of the whole subject and so I
 
03:11:31.630 --> 03:11:31.640 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly keeping an open mind and
 
03:11:33.510 --> 03:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
can be persuaded either
 
03:11:36.190 --> 03:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
way but I just wanted to be sure that we
 
03:11:38.590 --> 03:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
understood that the bill is that we're
 
03:11:40.389 --> 03:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
looking at as it is now is just
 
03:11:43.309 --> 03:11:43.319 align:start position:0%
outpatient facilities and that may be
 
03:11:44.910 --> 03:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
the way we want to go we may want to do
 
03:11:46.990 --> 03:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
something else but yeah and that is
 
03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:48.030 align:start position:0%
something else but yeah and that is
correct

03:11:48.030 --> 03:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:11:50.030 --> 03:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
because there is a separate bill looking
 
03:11:52.190 --> 03:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
at Silber homes representative
 
03:11:55.190 --> 03:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
supero yes I I think when the bill first
 
03:11:57.030 --> 03:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
got introduced to us there was a lot of
 
03:12:00.469 --> 03:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
confusing things in it and um and it it
 
03:12:03.349 --> 03:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
turns out that residential programs were
 
03:12:04.990 --> 03:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
not included in this and that's where
 
03:12:07.510 --> 03:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
the alleged abuse happened and they are
 
03:12:10.870 --> 03:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
already have some kind of oversight by
 
03:12:11.870 --> 03:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
um the
 
03:12:15.349 --> 03:12:15.359 align:start position:0%
department um so I think at our
 
03:12:20.389 --> 03:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
committee we I mean I probably not
 
03:12:22.670 --> 03:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
accepted by everyone but I think fairly
 
03:12:26.710 --> 03:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
broadly um accepted that services that
 
03:12:28.750 --> 03:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
are provided to New Hampshire citizens
 
03:12:32.070 --> 03:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
should have um healthc care um Services
 
03:12:34.030 --> 03:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
should have some kind of oversight by
 
03:12:37.510 --> 03:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
the state um whether that's strict or
 
03:12:40.950 --> 03:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
not so strict um I think that's broadly
 
03:12:44.030 --> 03:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
accepted and I think um this bill was
 
03:12:47.190 --> 03:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
brought because there's a certain um
 
03:12:49.550 --> 03:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
group of programs that that don't have
 
03:12:52.510 --> 03:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
any oversight and I think we got into at
 
03:12:56.429 --> 03:12:56.439 align:start position:0%
our committee we got into a a
 
03:13:02.070 --> 03:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
discussion about facilities meaning like
 
03:13:07.670 --> 03:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
buildings um or lenses like a licensed
 
03:13:10.830 --> 03:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
clinicians and I think
 
03:13:14.429 --> 03:13:14.439 align:start position:0%
um it is true that licensed clinicians
 
03:13:16.030 --> 03:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
already have oversight through the
 
03:13:19.150 --> 03:13:19.160 align:start position:0%
whatever board their Li Ed by um but I
 
03:13:21.750 --> 03:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
think some of these outpatient programs
 
03:13:24.389 --> 03:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
are not just and
 
03:13:26.950 --> 03:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
and I am certainly not an expert on this
 
03:13:29.349 --> 03:13:29.359 align:start position:0%
either but certain of these programs
 
03:13:31.469 --> 03:13:31.479 align:start position:0%
these although they're called outpatient
 
03:13:34.830 --> 03:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
programs they're not necessarily only
 
03:13:38.750 --> 03:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
individual counseling programs so um
 
03:13:41.349 --> 03:13:41.359 align:start position:0%
they may have people who are working at
 
03:13:43.269 --> 03:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
these programs who are not licensed so
 
03:13:46.389 --> 03:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
did not fall under the board of lers one
 
03:13:47.750 --> 03:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
of the boards
 
03:13:51.349 --> 03:13:51.359 align:start position:0%
and I I think we're not talking about um
 
03:13:53.630 --> 03:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
oversight over
 
03:13:58.429 --> 03:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
facilities or lies as much as um
 
03:14:01.590 --> 03:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
programs um you know kind of like having
 
03:14:03.670 --> 03:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
some kind of oversight
 
03:14:06.670 --> 03:14:06.680 align:start position:0%
of whether a program is effective
 
03:14:08.790 --> 03:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
whether there's U misconduct where
 
03:14:11.469 --> 03:14:11.479 align:start position:0%
somebody can go when there's misconduct
 
03:14:12.910 --> 03:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
and so that's the other part of the bill
 
03:14:14.670 --> 03:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
is to have an
 
03:14:18.469 --> 03:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
ombudsman um to um follow follow up on
 
03:14:18.479 --> 03:14:20.070 align:start position:0%
ombudsman um to um follow follow up on
complaints

03:14:20.070 --> 03:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
03:14:22.269 --> 03:14:22.279 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if that clarifies
 
03:14:25.150 --> 03:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
anything yeah I think it doesn't and I
 
03:14:28.150 --> 03:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
and I've had a lot of conversations over
 
03:14:30.110 --> 03:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
uh the summertime with a lot of folks
 
03:14:32.269 --> 03:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
who are skeptical about the bill and it
 
03:14:36.750 --> 03:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
all comes back to the whole oplc versus
 
03:14:39.990 --> 03:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
DHHS um approach which is why where
 
03:14:41.429 --> 03:14:41.439 align:start position:0%
where I'd like to kind of mine a little
 
03:14:45.870 --> 03:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
bit deeper um I did notice um if we go
 
03:14:50.710 --> 03:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
through a and we look at um the the the
 
03:14:54.590 --> 03:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
work that uh Miss Dyer did over the
 
03:14:56.590 --> 03:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
summer time where she was comparing
 
03:14:59.309 --> 03:14:59.319 align:start position:0%
different states so I'm going looking at
 
03:15:02.630 --> 03:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
appendix C I'm looking at a state like
 
03:15:05.150 --> 03:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
California where they are going in and
 
03:15:09.229 --> 03:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
they're going after the folks um who are
 
03:15:11.750 --> 03:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know the service providers as well
 
03:15:14.429 --> 03:15:14.439 align:start position:0%
as the facilities themselves but then I
 
03:15:17.429 --> 03:15:17.439 align:start position:0%
go and I look at a state like Florida
 
03:15:21.229 --> 03:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
where unless it's dealing with something
 
03:15:24.030 --> 03:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
related to the Department of Corrections
 
03:15:27.550 --> 03:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
they're just licensing uh the the
 
03:15:32.269 --> 03:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
providers so it seems like there's a
 
03:15:34.790 --> 03:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
Divergence there there's not Universal
 
03:15:39.670 --> 03:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
consistency there and so um thinking you
 
03:15:40.950 --> 03:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
know because a lot of the push backs
 
03:15:43.030 --> 03:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
just to share with everybody that I got
 
03:15:47.309 --> 03:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
back is why not just go the oplc
 
03:15:50.670 --> 03:15:50.680 align:start position:0%
am I say yeah the oplc route and have if
 
03:15:55.550 --> 03:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
everybody is a certified provider um and
 
03:15:57.150 --> 03:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
we're not talking residential care
 
03:15:59.070 --> 03:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
anymore that's outside of the purview of
 
03:16:02.189 --> 03:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
this bill would that not be adequate and
 
03:16:05.269 --> 03:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
so with that in mind go I go back to
 
03:16:10.990 --> 03:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
appendix a no sorry yeah appendix uh B
 
03:16:15.309 --> 03:16:15.319 align:start position:0%
sorry that uh was done over the summer
 
03:16:17.309 --> 03:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
and if you look the only thing I see
 
03:16:20.750 --> 03:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
that you know is a Certified Recovery
 
03:16:25.110 --> 03:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
support worker and a licensed clinical
 
03:16:28.550 --> 03:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
supervisor and a licensed alcohol drug
 
03:16:30.710 --> 03:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
counselor uh
 
03:16:34.349 --> 03:16:34.359 align:start position:0%
so it looks like when I'm looking at
 
03:16:39.189 --> 03:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
appendix B I have all of these things
 
03:16:44.189 --> 03:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
that exist already um so I guess the
 
03:16:46.950 --> 03:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
question I would have for you folks is
 
03:16:50.630 --> 03:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
even those facilities that you know
 
03:16:52.710 --> 03:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
operate outside of the realm of Medicaid
 
03:16:52.720 --> 03:16:53.510 align:start position:0%
operate outside of the realm of Medicaid
and

03:16:53.510 --> 03:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:16:57.110 --> 03:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
Medicare the folks that are employed
 
03:16:58.710 --> 03:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
that they still have to meet these
 
03:17:01.070 --> 03:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
criteria am I correct or not correct
 
03:17:03.790 --> 03:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
don't think so you don't think so okay
 
03:17:08.429 --> 03:17:08.439 align:start position:0%
so so I so I wonder um since we have
 
03:17:11.110 --> 03:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
appendix a
 
03:17:15.070 --> 03:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
types types types of substance used
 
03:17:18.229 --> 03:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
treatment in New Hampshire um um if this
 
03:17:18.239 --> 03:17:19.630 align:start position:0%
treatment in New Hampshire um um if this
is

03:17:19.630 --> 03:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:17:22.870 --> 03:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
indeed accurate I wonder if we could
 
03:17:24.429 --> 03:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
have someone from the Department go
 
03:17:27.830 --> 03:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
through these and say which ones of
 
03:17:30.229 --> 03:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
these um we're trying to address with
 
03:17:33.349 --> 03:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
this bill and do they in and those that
 
03:17:35.269 --> 03:17:35.279 align:start position:0%
we're trying to address do they in fact
 
03:17:36.429 --> 03:17:36.439 align:start position:0%
only have
 
03:17:41.630 --> 03:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:49.990 --> 03:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:50.000 --> 03:17:56.910 align:start position:0%
 
all

03:17:56.910 --> 03:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:59.790 --> 03:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
right so hi there I'm Jenny O Higgins
 
03:18:01.389 --> 03:18:01.399 align:start position:0%
I'm the legislative liaison for
 
03:18:04.070 --> 03:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health with DJ Jess welcome
 
03:18:05.870 --> 03:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so if we're looking at
 
03:18:09.070 --> 03:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
appendix a and we're looking at program
 
03:18:12.710 --> 03:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
type here um what you're looking at is
 
03:18:15.670 --> 03:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
actually the different levels of care
 
03:18:18.870 --> 03:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
under the Asam and so high-intensity
 
03:18:20.790 --> 03:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
residential and low intensity
 
03:18:22.670 --> 03:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
residential would both be
 
03:18:25.150 --> 03:18:25.160 align:start position:0%
licensed right by our Bureau of
 
03:18:27.910 --> 03:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
Licensing and so they they are regulated
 
03:18:31.790 --> 03:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
under the 826 rules of DHHS partial
 
03:18:34.950 --> 03:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
hospitalization is considered outpatient
 
03:18:37.630 --> 03:18:37.640 align:start position:0%
and so that would fall under the spill
 
03:18:39.389 --> 03:18:39.399 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at everyone's nodding with
 
03:18:42.469 --> 03:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
me so that's a good sign um an
 
03:18:44.469 --> 03:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
outpatient an intensive outpatient would
 
03:18:47.110 --> 03:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
all fall under this bill medic patient
 
03:18:49.670 --> 03:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
assisted uh treatment it can be at any
 
03:18:52.389 --> 03:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
level of care so medications for
 
03:18:54.750 --> 03:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder could be could be
 
03:18:56.189 --> 03:18:56.199 align:start position:0%
happening within inpatient and
 
03:18:56.199 --> 03:18:57.710 align:start position:0%
happening within inpatient and
outpatient

03:18:57.710 --> 03:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
outpatient
 
03:19:00.110 --> 03:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
settings um or through your primary care
 
03:19:01.189 --> 03:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
03:19:04.309 --> 03:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
really across the
 
03:19:09.510 --> 03:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:12.630 --> 03:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
outpatient recovery groups would not
 
03:19:15.710 --> 03:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
fall under certification or ler nor
 
03:19:17.309 --> 03:19:17.319 align:start position:0%
would recovery community centers or
 
03:19:19.710 --> 03:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
recovery housing those would not fall
 
03:19:22.590 --> 03:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
under this bill no right okay so
 
03:19:24.269 --> 03:19:24.279 align:start position:0%
recovery community
 
03:19:27.429 --> 03:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
centers and Recovery housing the
 
03:19:30.070 --> 03:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
department does help with help fund and
 
03:19:31.630 --> 03:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
help with quality oversight and
 
03:19:35.189 --> 03:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
everything of some of the R's programs
 
03:19:37.950 --> 03:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
um and there is a certification process
 
03:19:40.349 --> 03:19:40.359 align:start position:0%
in place for Recovery housing but those
 
03:19:43.110 --> 03:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
would be separate from this outpatient
 
03:19:48.670 --> 03:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:50.590 --> 03:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
so my next question
 
03:19:55.469 --> 03:19:55.479 align:start position:0%
is so those would be the kinds of
 
03:19:58.510 --> 03:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
facilities and programs that this bill
 
03:19:59.950 --> 03:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
would address the ones that you just
 
03:20:05.510 --> 03:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
highlighted so going into the B appendix
 
03:20:09.229 --> 03:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
then uh am I in the right one yes so
 
03:20:10.830 --> 03:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
going into the B
 
03:20:10.840 --> 03:20:12.510 align:start position:0%
going into the B
appendix

03:20:12.510 --> 03:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
appendix
 
03:20:16.790 --> 03:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
um it looks like like a licensed alcohol
 
03:20:19.349 --> 03:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
drug counselor these are all currently
 
03:20:21.309 --> 03:20:21.319 align:start position:0%
licensed with
 
03:20:24.349 --> 03:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
oplc yes so when we were looking at the
 
03:20:26.269 --> 03:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
types of or levels of care you're
 
03:20:28.150 --> 03:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
talking about licensing or certification
 
03:20:30.790 --> 03:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
through DHHS these are individuals with
 
03:20:33.389 --> 03:20:33.399 align:start position:0%
a license through oplc okay and
 
03:20:35.389 --> 03:20:35.399 align:start position:0%
regulated by oplc so it's sort of two
 
03:20:38.189 --> 03:20:38.199 align:start position:0%
layers so and just let me ask one more
 
03:20:41.510 --> 03:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
question represent shap leget so um are
 
03:20:45.550 --> 03:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
are there so is are there any gaps in
 
03:20:47.389 --> 03:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
this list
 
03:20:50.229 --> 03:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
relative to the the kinds of services
 
03:20:52.910 --> 03:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
that are being offered so I'm looking at
 
03:20:54.590 --> 03:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
this looks like a pretty comprehensive
 
03:20:57.830 --> 03:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
list of like a recovery worker you just
 
03:21:00.269 --> 03:21:00.279 align:start position:0%
can't be a recover a certified you just
 
03:21:02.030 --> 03:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
can't be a recovery support worker you
 
03:21:04.630 --> 03:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
have to be certified you can't just be a
 
03:21:06.469 --> 03:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
clinical supervisor you already have to
 
03:21:09.229 --> 03:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
be certified so those certifications
 
03:21:09.239 --> 03:21:10.389 align:start position:0%
be certified so those certifications
already

03:21:10.389 --> 03:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
already
 
03:21:14.469 --> 03:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
exist are there any gaps in the
 
03:21:18.389 --> 03:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
staff that you know you can think of so
 
03:21:20.030 --> 03:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
it's not this well I'm sorry I did
 
03:21:21.870 --> 03:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
misspeak earlier when I said oversight
 
03:21:23.950 --> 03:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
is listed in this um chart and I had
 
03:21:25.910 --> 03:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
said they were all overseen by oplc but
 
03:21:28.070 --> 03:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
you'll see on here Board of Pharmacy or
 
03:21:29.269 --> 03:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
or the Bureau of drug and alcohol
 
03:21:30.630 --> 03:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
Services listed so I just want to
 
03:21:32.870 --> 03:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
correct that first because I I just
 
03:21:34.750 --> 03:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
broadly said oplc but there's a couple
 
03:21:36.349 --> 03:21:36.359 align:start position:0%
different layers of oversight so
 
03:21:38.550 --> 03:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
Certified Recovery support workers are
 
03:21:42.710 --> 03:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
certified under Bas um but it's not the
 
03:21:44.309 --> 03:21:44.319 align:start position:0%
bill is not so much addressing a
 
03:21:47.590 --> 03:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
staffing issue as the outp patient care
 
03:21:50.309 --> 03:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
right and so and that and so the LIC
 
03:21:51.790 --> 03:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
those who are licensed and working
 
03:21:54.349 --> 03:21:54.359 align:start position:0%
within that outpatient care that that
 
03:21:57.870 --> 03:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
regulation already comes under oplc but
 
03:21:59.870 --> 03:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
there isn't the quality of care
 
03:22:02.429 --> 03:22:02.439 align:start position:0%
oversight in the outpatient space
 
03:22:04.269 --> 03:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
besides those who are contracted with
 
03:22:05.750 --> 03:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
the Department
 
03:22:08.309 --> 03:22:08.319 align:start position:0%
today hi I'm Sarah Cleveland I work for
 
03:22:10.790 --> 03:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of drug and alcohol services
 
03:22:13.269 --> 03:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
so the programs that we're talking about
 
03:22:14.590 --> 03:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
are partial
 
03:22:17.229 --> 03:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
hospitalization outpatient and int and
 
03:22:17.239 --> 03:22:18.670 align:start position:0%
hospitalization outpatient and int and
intensive

03:22:18.670 --> 03:22:18.680 align:start position:0%
intensive
 
03:22:21.630 --> 03:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
outpatient and the individuals within
 
03:22:25.110 --> 03:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
those services are licensed or certified
 
03:22:27.389 --> 03:22:27.399 align:start position:0%
but it's the program itself so it's like
 
03:22:30.150 --> 03:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
going to a doctor's office and your
 
03:22:32.469 --> 03:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
physician is licensed but maybe the
 
03:22:35.389 --> 03:22:35.399 align:start position:0%
entire practice isn't and if the
 
03:22:37.550 --> 03:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
individual staff members are not doing
 
03:22:41.030 --> 03:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
something that rises to the level of uh
 
03:22:42.349 --> 03:22:42.359 align:start position:0%
that could be investigated or a
 
03:22:45.349 --> 03:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
complaint but then there's nothing you
 
03:22:48.870 --> 03:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
can do to in terms of oversight if it's
 
03:22:52.830 --> 03:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
a broad spectrum problem over entire
 
03:22:55.070 --> 03:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
organization right now in outpatient we
 
03:22:57.750 --> 03:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:02.229 --> 03:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
anything representative Shapiro so first
 
03:23:04.830 --> 03:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
question is it so we're talking about
 
03:23:07.710 --> 03:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
three three of these categories three
 
03:23:09.670 --> 03:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
but two of them uh medication assist to
 
03:23:11.269 --> 03:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
treatment and ambulatory can happen at
 
03:23:14.269 --> 03:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
any level of care so they can happen in
 
03:23:15.469 --> 03:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
but we're not talking about those
 
03:23:17.710 --> 03:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
specifically right now so first question
 
03:23:20.950 --> 03:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
is are there might there be people who
 
03:23:23.590 --> 03:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
work in these programs who are not
 
03:23:23.600 --> 03:23:25.150 align:start position:0%
work in these programs who are not
licensed

03:23:25.150 --> 03:23:25.160 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
03:23:28.750 --> 03:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
yes at what kind of level is it office
 
03:23:32.110 --> 03:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
staff or is it um is it some kind of
 
03:23:35.030 --> 03:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
doing some kind of clinical or support
 
03:23:37.229 --> 03:23:37.239 align:start position:0%
work not clinical work but maybe support
 
03:23:39.910 --> 03:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
work people working toward their
 
03:23:43.070 --> 03:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
crsw but haven't gotten it yet um a lot
 
03:23:44.469 --> 03:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
of times people who are working toward
 
03:23:46.070 --> 03:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
their CR who don't actually start
 
03:23:48.429 --> 03:23:48.439 align:start position:0%
working toward their crsw till they've
 
03:23:50.790 --> 03:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
been working there for a while or don't
 
03:23:52.830 --> 03:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
want to work toward their crsw because
 
03:23:56.030 --> 03:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
of the time and expensive crsw Certified
 
03:23:58.870 --> 03:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
Recovery support worker thank you um so
 
03:24:00.910 --> 03:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
okay so there are some unlicensed people
 
03:24:04.830 --> 03:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
in these programs and
 
03:24:08.070 --> 03:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
um but like I said if if nothing that an
 
03:24:12.429 --> 03:24:12.439 align:start position:0%
individual is doing arises to um a level
 
03:24:15.469 --> 03:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
that you can bring to a board if it's
 
03:24:17.710 --> 03:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
just a broad organiz
 
03:24:21.389 --> 03:24:21.399 align:start position:0%
ational incompetence right can be could
 
03:24:22.790 --> 03:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
you give
 
03:24:26.870 --> 03:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
us make up an example or um like what
 
03:24:29.670 --> 03:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
would be kind of a broader type of
 
03:24:31.830 --> 03:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
dysfunction or a broader type of
 
03:24:34.229 --> 03:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
misconduct or a broader type of
 
03:24:37.830 --> 03:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
inefficiency of services that might not
 
03:24:40.189 --> 03:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
might not come under the umbrella of the
 
03:24:43.510 --> 03:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
licensing board but be be a more Pro
 
03:24:45.269 --> 03:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
programmatic problem can you give an
 
03:24:47.990 --> 03:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
example yeah sure size of a group would
 
03:24:49.910 --> 03:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
be an example that comes to mind right
 
03:24:54.349 --> 03:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
so like the an appropriate size of um a
 
03:24:56.670 --> 03:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
recovery support like group group being
 
03:24:59.469 --> 03:24:59.479 align:start position:0%
held by by a clinician though so that
 
03:25:02.229 --> 03:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
type of service would be in our rulle
 
03:25:04.510 --> 03:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
making today for those nine agencies
 
03:25:07.389 --> 03:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
that we are able to have oversight over
 
03:25:10.110 --> 03:25:10.120 align:start position:0%
so the amount of um people in a group
 
03:25:12.910 --> 03:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
relative to the facilitators of the
 
03:25:15.349 --> 03:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
clinicians okay following best practice
 
03:25:16.990 --> 03:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of treatment using
 
03:25:19.710 --> 03:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practices that's nothing
 
03:25:22.910 --> 03:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
that the um oplc is going to investigate
 
03:25:25.950 --> 03:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
but as if it's the culture within an
 
03:25:29.110 --> 03:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
agency then that would be something that
 
03:25:37.150 --> 03:25:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:40.670 --> 03:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
um as a former clinician myself I'm I
 
03:25:43.189 --> 03:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
always like um concerned when people use
 
03:25:45.150 --> 03:25:45.160 align:start position:0%
the term evidence-based practices
 
03:25:46.750 --> 03:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
because people just use it but they
 
03:25:48.950 --> 03:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
never talk about what the evidence is
 
03:25:51.189 --> 03:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
but but if there was if there was a
 
03:25:53.590 --> 03:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
practice using a model being used that's
 
03:25:56.510 --> 03:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
a discredited model um that would be an
 
03:26:00.590 --> 03:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
example right um I mean there have been
 
03:26:02.630 --> 03:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
groups through the history of substance
 
03:26:06.030 --> 03:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
use this order programs that are maybe
 
03:26:10.030 --> 03:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
cultish that kind of thing um so if it
 
03:26:12.389 --> 03:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
was a discredited model or model that
 
03:26:13.830 --> 03:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
there were concerns about it being
 
03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
harmful that would come under this
 
03:26:15.840 --> 03:26:16.870 align:start position:0%
harmful that would come under this
versus

03:26:16.870 --> 03:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
versus
 
03:26:20.030 --> 03:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
um maybe the licensing board maybe both
 
03:26:23.830 --> 03:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
but okay representative Weber yeah that
 
03:26:26.349 --> 03:26:26.359 align:start position:0%
that was kind of my follow on is I I
 
03:26:28.510 --> 03:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
would assume that under most conditions
 
03:26:32.030 --> 03:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
it probably wouldn't be an either or but
 
03:26:34.550 --> 03:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
if am I right in thinking that one of
 
03:26:38.670 --> 03:26:38.680 align:start position:0%
the issues might be that you could bring
 
03:26:41.229 --> 03:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
an action against a particular clinician
 
03:26:46.950 --> 03:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
for that clinician's actions but even
 
03:26:49.429 --> 03:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
and and remembering that those are quite
 
03:26:53.790 --> 03:26:53.800 align:start position:0%
cumbersome uh that it then then you've
 
03:26:56.429 --> 03:26:56.439 align:start position:0%
dealt with that clinician but there are
 
03:26:59.790 --> 03:26:59.800 align:start position:0%
many other clinicians who might come and
 
03:27:02.670 --> 03:27:02.680 align:start position:0%
continue the program that is still
 
03:27:05.550 --> 03:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
similarly discredited and and may I just
 
03:27:08.630 --> 03:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
put you entirely on the spot and say are
 
03:27:11.950 --> 03:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
you is the department in favor of this
 
03:27:13.990 --> 03:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
legislation at least in concept or
 
03:27:16.830 --> 03:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
taking no position or
 
03:27:19.309 --> 03:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
um if you don't want to take a position
 
03:27:20.830 --> 03:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
that's fine I'm just trying to figure
 
03:27:23.790 --> 03:27:23.800 align:start position:0%
out P we're all on conceptually in favor
 
03:27:25.070 --> 03:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
would not be able to implement it
 
03:27:27.389 --> 03:27:27.399 align:start position:0%
without staff so there's there is
 
03:27:30.309 --> 03:27:30.319 align:start position:0%
language in the existing bill that says
 
03:27:33.510 --> 03:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
with subject to funding yes and I I
 
03:27:35.229 --> 03:27:35.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate that distinction we hear
 
03:27:37.469 --> 03:27:37.479 align:start position:0%
about that all the time and to run an
 
03:27:39.950 --> 03:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
outpatient treatment center you don't to
 
03:27:42.189 --> 03:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
own one you don't have to be licensed or
 
03:27:44.469 --> 03:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
certified so if an owner is saying You
 
03:27:46.750 --> 03:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
must follow x y and z when doing
 
03:27:48.510 --> 03:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
treatment well you can get rid of
 
03:27:50.389 --> 03:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
individual practitioners but if that's
 
03:27:52.429 --> 03:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
still continuing right there's nothing
 
03:27:54.670 --> 03:27:54.680 align:start position:0%
that can be done it's also the
 
03:27:57.309 --> 03:27:57.319 align:start position:0%
individual the intimidation of an
 
03:28:00.150 --> 03:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
individual in a very vulnerable state
 
03:28:02.590 --> 03:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
and how do we bring forward potential
 
03:28:05.150 --> 03:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
allegations of misconduct and so the
 
03:28:08.189 --> 03:28:08.199 align:start position:0%
idea of making sure that the programs
 
03:28:10.630 --> 03:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
fall under the existing Department wide
 
03:28:13.550 --> 03:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
on busman's office right what could
 
03:28:15.309 --> 03:28:15.319 align:start position:0%
potentially be a critical place for
 
03:28:17.630 --> 03:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
people to report if we were if those
 
03:28:19.670 --> 03:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
things were well posted and and
 
03:28:21.550 --> 03:28:21.560 align:start position:0%
education were available to make sure
 
03:28:23.910 --> 03:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
that people knew how to come forward
 
03:28:25.990 --> 03:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
right today it's a pretty intimidating
 
03:28:29.870 --> 03:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
process to try to uh name a clinician
 
03:28:33.590 --> 03:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
well may I have a followup yes and and I
 
03:28:36.670 --> 03:28:36.680 align:start position:0%
I now have small amount of Greater
 
03:28:39.269 --> 03:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
knowledge because in the course of
 
03:28:41.349 --> 03:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
another volunteer job that I have I've
 
03:28:44.269 --> 03:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
now encount encountered the partial
 
03:28:46.950 --> 03:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
hospitalization program
 
03:28:51.990 --> 03:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
and uh am aware now that I wasn't before
 
03:28:54.269 --> 03:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
of how very intensive that kind of a
 
03:28:57.590 --> 03:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
program is so you know to me there's a
 
03:28:59.469 --> 03:28:59.479 align:start position:0%
great difference between something that
 
03:29:02.830 --> 03:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to a couple of hours
 
03:29:05.710 --> 03:29:05.720 align:start position:0%
one afternoon a week and my
 
03:29:06.910 --> 03:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is that these are often
 
03:29:10.389 --> 03:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
full day programs 5 days a week and and
 
03:29:15.110 --> 03:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
very intensive in terms of therapy so um
 
03:29:17.950 --> 03:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
it it um
 
03:29:20.790 --> 03:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
those two things make a huge difference
 
03:29:24.429 --> 03:29:24.439 align:start position:0%
in my mind and I think I I'll just speak
 
03:29:28.070 --> 03:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
for myself conceptually um I think it's
 
03:29:31.790 --> 03:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
very important frankly to have some kind
 
03:29:35.790 --> 03:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
of oversight to the program as well as
 
03:29:39.710 --> 03:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
the uh certification I mean and I I come
 
03:29:41.670 --> 03:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
from a background as an attorney you
 
03:29:43.950 --> 03:29:43.960 align:start position:0%
can't own a law practice unless you are
 
03:29:43.960 --> 03:29:44.790 align:start position:0%
can't own a law practice unless you are
an

03:29:44.790 --> 03:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
an
 
03:29:46.950 --> 03:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
attorney um
 
03:29:50.990 --> 03:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
so you know you are you the owners are
 
03:29:53.550 --> 03:29:53.560 align:start position:0%
subject to attorney discipline from
 
03:29:56.389 --> 03:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
moment one or at least that's the way it
 
03:29:57.870 --> 03:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
was when I was practicing it may have
 
03:30:04.429 --> 03:30:04.439 align:start position:0%
changed but um the the concern I have is
 
03:30:07.750 --> 03:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
the global organization that comes and
 
03:30:10.550 --> 03:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
and and you know they're the employer
 
03:30:11.910 --> 03:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
they get to say what they're going to do
 
03:30:13.309 --> 03:30:13.319 align:start position:0%
and people have the choice well I'm
 
03:30:15.830 --> 03:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
going to quit and go somewhere else but
 
03:30:15.840 --> 03:30:16.830 align:start position:0%
going to quit and go somewhere else but
uh

03:30:16.830 --> 03:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:30:18.830 --> 03:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
I also know the number of people who are
 
03:30:20.429 --> 03:30:20.439 align:start position:0%
motivated to
 
03:30:24.189 --> 03:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
enter this area of care want to help
 
03:30:27.910 --> 03:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
people and and so they're probably not
 
03:30:30.990 --> 03:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
going to be quite so much okay my way or
 
03:30:33.229 --> 03:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
the highway is as they would be if they
 
03:30:35.189 --> 03:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
were working in retail and could go to
 
03:30:35.199 --> 03:30:36.110 align:start position:0%
were working in retail and could go to
another

03:30:36.110 --> 03:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:30:41.670 --> 03:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
store um so I certainly conceptually am
 
03:30:46.030 --> 03:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
very much on the side of the department
 
03:30:49.150 --> 03:30:49.160 align:start position:0%
Department ought to have some oversight
 
03:30:50.309 --> 03:30:50.319 align:start position:0%
over the
 
03:30:54.910 --> 03:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
program as well as the oplc having the
 
03:30:57.710 --> 03:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
oversight over individual clinicians
 
03:30:59.150 --> 03:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
because I think that there there two
 
03:31:01.150 --> 03:31:01.160 align:start position:0%
different possibilities you you can have
 
03:31:03.870 --> 03:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
one bad apple and that's obviously can
 
03:31:07.269 --> 03:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
be taken care of by oplc but it's the
 
03:31:07.279 --> 03:31:08.389 align:start position:0%
be taken care of by oplc but it's the
overall

03:31:08.389 --> 03:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
overall
 
03:31:11.870 --> 03:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
culture and the vulnerability of the
 
03:31:13.590 --> 03:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
people in the
 
03:31:16.590 --> 03:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
program by definition
 
03:31:17.910 --> 03:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
that to
 
03:31:20.710 --> 03:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
me really means that we need to know
 
03:31:23.429 --> 03:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
what's going on there are also a lot of
 
03:31:26.750 --> 03:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
out of state um companies that have
 
03:31:28.750 --> 03:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
started programs in the state that we
 
03:31:31.710 --> 03:31:31.720 align:start position:0%
don't know about because they don't get
 
03:31:33.750 --> 03:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
insurance through Medicaid they don't
 
03:31:34.710 --> 03:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
get any
 
03:31:37.870 --> 03:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
oversight and their owners may be from
 
03:31:40.150 --> 03:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
Florida California
 
03:31:42.750 --> 03:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
and we don't know who they are can't get
 
03:31:44.469 --> 03:31:44.479 align:start position:0%
in touch with them don't know what
 
03:31:47.710 --> 03:31:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:51.309 --> 03:31:51.319 align:start position:0%
so um and and I'm kind of leaning you
 
03:31:55.150 --> 03:31:55.160 align:start position:0%
know as you are towards some oversight
 
03:31:58.229 --> 03:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
on the programs um and I've had some
 
03:31:59.670 --> 03:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
discussions about that but on the other
 
03:32:00.990 --> 03:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
hand I do want to push back because
 
03:32:02.630 --> 03:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
there are other folks that push back on
 
03:32:05.389 --> 03:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
me and you know when we talk about for
 
03:32:07.670 --> 03:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
example the use of we don't want to have
 
03:32:09.750 --> 03:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
people using discredited practices and
 
03:32:13.269 --> 03:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
we agree but sometimes that can be uh
 
03:32:15.910 --> 03:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
you know maybe a catchall which may
 
03:32:18.429 --> 03:32:18.439 align:start position:0%
stifle Innovation and so some of the
 
03:32:20.150 --> 03:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
push back you know that I'm getting when
 
03:32:22.710 --> 03:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
I'm because I'm trying to talk to gauge
 
03:32:24.790 --> 03:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
support from a diverse crowd they're
 
03:32:26.590 --> 03:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
saying is you know when you talk about
 
03:32:29.309 --> 03:32:29.319 align:start position:0%
discredited practices are we going to be
 
03:32:31.510 --> 03:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
potentially stifling some Innovation
 
03:32:36.830 --> 03:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
here whatever so the utsman portion of
 
03:32:41.389 --> 03:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
the bill is there um so if you get into
 
03:32:44.790 --> 03:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
a situation where you have you know a
 
03:32:47.389 --> 03:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
clinician is taking on too many people
 
03:32:49.550 --> 03:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
or they're really engaged in some
 
03:32:51.510 --> 03:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
practices that are really really out
 
03:32:57.469 --> 03:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
there um is that adequate or um do you
 
03:32:59.189 --> 03:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
do you feel that there are deficiencies
 
03:33:01.150 --> 03:33:01.160 align:start position:0%
within that that know even with the
 
03:33:03.750 --> 03:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
edsman we still would like to have the
 
03:33:05.670 --> 03:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
program oversight so I just would like
 
03:33:07.630 --> 03:33:07.640 align:start position:0%
to these programs would not fall under
 
03:33:09.630 --> 03:33:09.640 align:start position:0%
the EMB budsman unless the certification
 
03:33:12.630 --> 03:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
was in existence so the edsman covers
 
03:33:15.950 --> 03:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
Department programs but today the way
 
03:33:19.790 --> 03:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
that this the the way the RSA um reads
 
03:33:23.510 --> 03:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
is that the department can certify those
 
03:33:26.429 --> 03:33:26.439 align:start position:0%
um substance use providers in with whom
 
03:33:29.510 --> 03:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
they're in contract with which is nine
 
03:33:31.389 --> 03:33:31.399 align:start position:0%
of providers in the state today that
 
03:33:33.150 --> 03:33:33.160 align:start position:0%
were in contract with throughout patient
 
03:33:35.990 --> 03:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
services but we know there to be 65
 
03:33:37.790 --> 03:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
providers registered with Medicaid with
 
03:33:39.990 --> 03:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
over a 100 locations and that's only
 
03:33:42.590 --> 03:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
those that take Medicaid so the
 
03:33:44.590 --> 03:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
landscape of services that exists
 
03:33:47.269 --> 03:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
outside of whom we already oversee it
 
03:33:48.870 --> 03:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
would be those nine providers that the
 
03:33:51.710 --> 03:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
um budsman could uh take complaints and
 
03:33:53.429 --> 03:33:53.439 align:start position:0%
investigate right now without the
 
03:33:55.269 --> 03:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
certification if someone who was going
 
03:33:57.510 --> 03:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
to a facility that we had no oversight
 
03:33:59.510 --> 03:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
of went to the um budsman they wouldn't
 
03:34:02.070 --> 03:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
be able to do anything so let me just
 
03:34:04.110 --> 03:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
ask a follow-up question out of complete
 
03:34:07.510 --> 03:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
ignorance so recently we brought into
 
03:34:12.910 --> 03:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
place a right to know Ombudsman um
 
03:34:16.710 --> 03:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
and would it would it be possible
 
03:34:19.950 --> 03:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
or is yeah is it possible to maybe
 
03:34:23.349 --> 03:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
modify um the I guess the terms of the
 
03:34:26.389 --> 03:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
armman so redefine what the aitman is
 
03:34:29.150 --> 03:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
able to do and not able to do so as as
 
03:34:31.429 --> 03:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
it is currently laid out the aitman can
 
03:34:33.189 --> 03:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
only do what you say it can only go
 
03:34:35.469 --> 03:34:35.479 align:start position:0%
through you know that which is uh
 
03:34:39.150 --> 03:34:39.160 align:start position:0%
certified licensed by the department um
 
03:34:42.630 --> 03:34:42.640 align:start position:0%
is is a better approach to basically
 
03:34:45.830 --> 03:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
broaden that portfolio um or do you
 
03:34:47.630 --> 03:34:47.640 align:start position:0%
think even if it could be broadened to
 
03:34:50.389 --> 03:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
look after this we would still need to
 
03:34:52.550 --> 03:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
have the oversight of the
 
03:34:55.510 --> 03:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
department I think that we they wouldn't
 
03:34:57.469 --> 03:34:57.479 align:start position:0%
what what would they be investigating
 
03:34:59.790 --> 03:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
without the rules under certification so
 
03:35:02.870 --> 03:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
if the um budsman goes out to uh follow
 
03:35:05.309 --> 03:35:05.319 align:start position:0%
up after a complaint but there is no
 
03:35:08.710 --> 03:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
certification of those programs it's
 
03:35:11.910 --> 03:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
oplc or if it's a clinician within the
 
03:35:13.550 --> 03:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
program that's one thing because you can
 
03:35:16.070 --> 03:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
go to oplc but it's sort of that or
 
03:35:17.670 --> 03:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
nothing if they're not licensed or
 
03:35:19.269 --> 03:35:19.279 align:start position:0%
certified so I think the EMB budsman
 
03:35:22.229 --> 03:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
would need to be investigating a breach
 
03:35:24.189 --> 03:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
of something in
 
03:35:27.510 --> 03:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
Rule and I would also add that the udman
 
03:35:29.910 --> 03:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
it relies on complaints and this is an
 
03:35:32.510 --> 03:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
extremely vulnerable population who is
 
03:35:35.070 --> 03:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
in uh excuse me sorry Jamie Powers I'm
 
03:35:37.150 --> 03:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
the CEO for Life Services for Recovery
 
03:35:38.670 --> 03:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
which includes Gate House treatment
 
03:35:40.349 --> 03:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
which is one of the outpatient programs
 
03:35:43.229 --> 03:35:43.239 align:start position:0%
that would be um fall under this
 
03:35:46.389 --> 03:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
legislation and you the folks that we're
 
03:35:49.070 --> 03:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with are they're scared they
 
03:35:51.990 --> 03:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily know what is okay and
 
03:35:54.189 --> 03:35:54.199 align:start position:0%
what is not okay so the likelihood of
 
03:35:58.309 --> 03:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
them raising a complaint is fairly low
 
03:36:00.670 --> 03:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
whereas a more proactive
 
03:36:03.830 --> 03:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
certification gives people an idea of
 
03:36:06.269 --> 03:36:06.279 align:start position:0%
who's out there what's right and allows
 
03:36:08.550 --> 03:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
the department to have a set of
 
03:36:10.550 --> 03:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
standards that are not currently in
 
03:36:13.070 --> 03:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
place so just to just to clarify them
 
03:36:15.189 --> 03:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
from my own mind and kind of say back
 
03:36:18.070 --> 03:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
what I think you're saying the armman
 
03:36:20.469 --> 03:36:20.479 align:start position:0%
could go in if we expanded this the role
 
03:36:23.309 --> 03:36:23.319 align:start position:0%
without these rules he could say you are
 
03:36:26.309 --> 03:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
a bad practitioner I can take action on
 
03:36:30.870 --> 03:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
you but uh if you're seeing 25 patients
 
03:36:33.189 --> 03:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
or whatever best practices I can't
 
03:36:35.550 --> 03:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
really get after for the for the
 
03:36:37.950 --> 03:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
facility the the current today um
 
03:36:40.229 --> 03:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
budsman oversees the Departments
 
03:36:43.189 --> 03:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
programs so that means only the nine
 
03:36:44.790 --> 03:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
that are contracted with the Bureau of
 
03:36:46.510 --> 03:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
drug and alcohol services in terms of
 
03:36:48.990 --> 03:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
substance use treatment and that means
 
03:36:51.349 --> 03:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
that they that what the EMB budsman
 
03:36:52.790 --> 03:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
would investigate is a breach of the
 
03:36:57.030 --> 03:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
rule under our RSA 172 and so that's
 
03:36:59.349 --> 03:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
where that's where that investigation
 
03:37:01.150 --> 03:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
would sort of take place if it were a
 
03:37:03.469 --> 03:37:03.479 align:start position:0%
clinical piece it would still go to oplc
 
03:37:05.150 --> 03:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that's very helpful you
 
03:37:06.990 --> 03:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
had a question representative we well
 
03:37:10.590 --> 03:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of exploring the questions that
 
03:37:12.110 --> 03:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
you had a little further because you
 
03:37:13.550 --> 03:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
were talking about the right to know
 
03:37:16.229 --> 03:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman but I'm wondering if
 
03:37:20.070 --> 03:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
um a more apt parallel would be to be
 
03:37:23.150 --> 03:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
the office of the child advocate
 
03:37:26.070 --> 03:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
and they
 
03:37:29.750 --> 03:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
are given much broader investigatory
 
03:37:32.510 --> 03:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
Powers than your um budsman that we're
 
03:37:34.429 --> 03:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
referring to here half where it's a very
 
03:37:38.389 --> 03:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
specific and very narrow um purview and
 
03:37:40.510 --> 03:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
so there there are two things that I'm
 
03:37:43.950 --> 03:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
thinking about first of all uh do we
 
03:37:46.870 --> 03:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
simply expand the power of the Ombudsman
 
03:37:48.590 --> 03:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
to inquire
 
03:37:53.349 --> 03:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
into the treatment of vulnerable
 
03:37:57.110 --> 03:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
people receiving
 
03:38:00.429 --> 03:38:00.439 align:start position:0%
treatment on the one hand and do we do
 
03:38:02.510 --> 03:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
the whole rule making process on the
 
03:38:07.150 --> 03:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
other I mean my understanding is that um
 
03:38:08.830 --> 03:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
you know when when the office of the
 
03:38:11.269 --> 03:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
child advocate went to Tennessee and saw
 
03:38:14.269 --> 03:38:14.279 align:start position:0%
the conditions under which uh kids who
 
03:38:16.229 --> 03:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
were theoretically
 
03:38:17.990 --> 03:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
being treated
 
03:38:21.229 --> 03:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
were basically incarcerated and also
 
03:38:25.790 --> 03:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
subject to various forms of complete
 
03:38:25.800 --> 03:38:27.790 align:start position:0%
subject to various forms of complete
humiliation

03:38:27.790 --> 03:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
humiliation
 
03:38:31.349 --> 03:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
um it it it seemed to me to there there
 
03:38:32.870 --> 03:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
may have been actual rules that were
 
03:38:34.750 --> 03:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
broken there but it seems to me that it
 
03:38:38.070 --> 03:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
was a broader inquiry into the welfare
 
03:38:39.830 --> 03:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
of a vulnerable
 
03:38:44.550 --> 03:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
population so I guess my question both
 
03:38:47.110 --> 03:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
for you and for the committee is what a
 
03:38:50.469 --> 03:38:50.479 align:start position:0%
good step first step if if i' prefer to
 
03:38:53.990 --> 03:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
have all of this but if we can't and one
 
03:38:55.710 --> 03:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
of the things I'm thinking about is what
 
03:38:57.710 --> 03:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
we have heard about budget constraints
 
03:39:01.910 --> 03:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
going forward would it be possible to
 
03:39:05.229 --> 03:39:05.239 align:start position:0%
Simply um broaden
 
03:39:09.429 --> 03:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
the Mandate or the
 
03:39:12.510 --> 03:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
permissible I I it's more permissive
 
03:39:12.520 --> 03:39:13.309 align:start position:0%
permissible I I it's more permissive
than

03:39:13.309 --> 03:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
than
 
03:39:15.910 --> 03:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
mandate um of the
 
03:39:19.269 --> 03:39:19.279 align:start position:0%
existing utsman to investigate
 
03:39:21.990 --> 03:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
programs that don't fall under their
 
03:39:22.000 --> 03:39:23.110 align:start position:0%
programs that don't fall under their
mandate

03:39:23.110 --> 03:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
03:39:27.670 --> 03:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
now I just go back to what would they be
 
03:39:29.950 --> 03:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
held what standard would they be held to
 
03:39:31.349 --> 03:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
without the ru making of the
 
03:39:33.510 --> 03:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
certification so you wouldn't be able to
 
03:39:36.349 --> 03:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
say sort of your group is too large back
 
03:39:38.790 --> 03:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
to other example the per the ratio of
 
03:39:43.110 --> 03:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
clinician to to um folks with in
 
03:39:45.349 --> 03:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
treatment is too large because that is
 
03:39:47.550 --> 03:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
is n written anywhere or it's written in
 
03:39:49.429 --> 03:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
rule for those who are contracted with
 
03:39:51.189 --> 03:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
us but if you're not contracted with us
 
03:39:53.070 --> 03:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
even if the um budsman is expanded I
 
03:39:54.469 --> 03:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
don't know what standard you're holding
 
03:39:56.070 --> 03:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
they don't have any requirement I'm a
 
03:39:57.830 --> 03:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
private business owner and that person
 
03:39:59.389 --> 03:39:59.399 align:start position:0%
would come to my business and say I want
 
03:40:01.189 --> 03:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
to investigate you I'd say under What
 
03:40:04.349 --> 03:40:04.359 align:start position:0%
whose authority right okay fair
 
03:40:08.630 --> 03:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
enough thank you for that representative
 
03:40:11.229 --> 03:40:11.239 align:start position:0%
Shapiro I'm I apologize but I didn't
 
03:40:12.750 --> 03:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
catch your name but I did catch that
 
03:40:14.950 --> 03:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
you're a CEO of some kind of program
 
03:40:17.790 --> 03:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
that falls under
 
03:40:20.510 --> 03:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
this Jamie Powers I'm the CEO for Gate
 
03:40:23.269 --> 03:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
House treatment in nsha and Gate House
 
03:40:25.950 --> 03:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
treatment has which of these types of
 
03:40:27.550 --> 03:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
program partial hospitalization and
 
03:40:30.510 --> 03:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
intensive outpatient uh with mat okay so
 
03:40:34.309 --> 03:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
can I ask you um the question
 
03:40:36.309 --> 03:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
referencing um comments that
 
03:40:38.910 --> 03:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
representative mlan made before about um
 
03:40:43.510 --> 03:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
stifling Innovation or um being I don't
 
03:40:44.950 --> 03:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
know maybe another way to put it is
 
03:40:47.189 --> 03:40:47.199 align:start position:0%
being overly prescriptive about what
 
03:40:50.189 --> 03:40:50.199 align:start position:0%
kinds models of treatment are used and
 
03:40:53.910 --> 03:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
what kind aren't used so would you have
 
03:40:56.269 --> 03:40:56.279 align:start position:0%
concerns about that if if this kind of
 
03:40:59.870 --> 03:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
bill went into effect I I would not and
 
03:41:01.710 --> 03:41:01.720 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is i' I've been in
 
03:41:03.630 --> 03:41:03.640 align:start position:0%
the field in New Hampshire for close to
 
03:41:07.110 --> 03:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
20 years now and the model we've always
 
03:41:10.030 --> 03:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
used is evidence-based practices and
 
03:41:13.469 --> 03:41:13.479 align:start position:0%
that because the definition of that is
 
03:41:16.830 --> 03:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
somewhat Broad and it includes sort
 
03:41:16.840 --> 03:41:18.110 align:start position:0%
somewhat Broad and it includes sort
promising

03:41:18.110 --> 03:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
promising
 
03:41:21.150 --> 03:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
practices that we've seen a great deal
 
03:41:23.269 --> 03:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
of innovation over the years and
 
03:41:25.070 --> 03:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes that innovation has become
 
03:41:26.630 --> 03:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
part of our system and sometimes we've
 
03:41:28.910 --> 03:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
realized maybe it was not our best plan
 
03:41:31.429 --> 03:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
ever and we've backed away from it but
 
03:41:33.790 --> 03:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
there's never been a case that I am
 
03:41:38.269 --> 03:41:38.279 align:start position:0%
aware of where by being contracted or um
 
03:41:41.070 --> 03:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
a Medicaid provider I felt that we were
 
03:41:44.389 --> 03:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
unable to innovate our care in our Care
 
03:41:46.349 --> 03:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
thank you and innovation in this field
 
03:41:48.630 --> 03:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
is so needed and it's we're always
 
03:41:52.630 --> 03:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
looking for new things new that are um
 
03:41:54.830 --> 03:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
productive and that really help clients
 
03:41:56.030 --> 03:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
we're really trying to move in that
 
03:41:57.910 --> 03:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
direction yeah so I I just kind of want
 
03:42:01.110 --> 03:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
to hammer that point home so so you
 
03:42:03.870 --> 03:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
you're contracted with Medicaid and
 
03:42:07.710 --> 03:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
you're finding no stifling of innovation
 
03:42:11.870 --> 03:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
and these rules that we would be
 
03:42:14.269 --> 03:42:14.279 align:start position:0%
bringing forth if this legislation was
 
03:42:17.750 --> 03:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
to pass would be going in that same
 
03:42:21.750 --> 03:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
direction so basically the same
 
03:42:23.269 --> 03:42:23.279 align:start position:0%
basically it's going to be in the same
 
03:42:25.269 --> 03:42:25.279 align:start position:0%
Lane I'm not going to be adding in extra
 
03:42:27.590 --> 03:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
things over what would be for the folks
 
03:42:30.349 --> 03:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
that are um it would be very similar
 
03:42:33.830 --> 03:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
very similar okay thank
 
03:42:37.229 --> 03:42:37.239 align:start position:0%
you sorry Weber and I'm just going to
 
03:42:39.830 --> 03:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
reiterate one of the uh points that I
 
03:42:41.510 --> 03:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
think I made at the earlier meeting
 
03:42:45.269 --> 03:42:45.279 align:start position:0%
which was that um not only is innovation
 
03:42:46.630 --> 03:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
important but I
 
03:42:49.750 --> 03:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
think it seems to me without any kind of
 
03:42:51.469 --> 03:42:51.479 align:start position:0%
formal training in this it's kind of
 
03:42:55.149 --> 03:42:55.159 align:start position:0%
axiomatic to me that the the kinds of
 
03:42:57.950 --> 03:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
treatments that might be effective for
 
03:43:02.269 --> 03:43:02.279 align:start position:0%
me might not at all be effective for
 
03:43:04.750 --> 03:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
somebody else even though we have an
 
03:43:06.950 --> 03:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
addiction that may look very
 
03:43:12.630 --> 03:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
similar um our life experiences are our
 
03:43:12.640 --> 03:43:13.950 align:start position:0%
similar um our life experiences are our
body

03:43:13.950 --> 03:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
body
 
03:43:16.710 --> 03:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
chemistry uh the amount of trauma that
 
03:43:18.550 --> 03:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
we have undergone for one reason or
 
03:43:22.870 --> 03:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
another and the types May dictate very
 
03:43:24.670 --> 03:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
very different
 
03:43:27.830 --> 03:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
treatments and so I I too I want to be
 
03:43:29.590 --> 03:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not either stifling
 
03:43:34.269 --> 03:43:34.279 align:start position:0%
Innovation or uh limiting to any one
 
03:43:37.830 --> 03:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
school of thought because it seems to me
 
03:43:39.149 --> 03:43:39.159 align:start position:0%
that we
 
03:43:42.429 --> 03:43:42.439 align:start position:0%
need the the more we provide a wide
 
03:43:45.389 --> 03:43:45.399 align:start position:0%
range of things that are useful to at
 
03:43:47.429 --> 03:43:47.439 align:start position:0%
least a certain segment of our
 
03:43:49.830 --> 03:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
population we're we're better off we're
 
03:43:51.550 --> 03:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
we're serving people better one issue
 
03:43:53.469 --> 03:43:53.479 align:start position:0%
the field has had has actually
 
03:43:56.149 --> 03:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
been having the same type of treatment
 
03:43:59.070 --> 03:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
for every single client within a program
 
03:44:02.149 --> 03:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
which is completely antithetical to the
 
03:44:03.790 --> 03:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
direction the field is moving in it's
 
03:44:05.510 --> 03:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
moving toward very individualized
 
03:44:07.229 --> 03:44:07.239 align:start position:0%
treatment but that's not really
 
03:44:09.630 --> 03:44:09.640 align:start position:0%
something you could complain to oplc
 
03:44:11.429 --> 03:44:11.439 align:start position:0%
about if you're using an evidence-based
 
03:44:13.670 --> 03:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
practice it's just not appropriate for
 
03:44:15.830 --> 03:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
um this particular client well it's my
 
03:44:17.429 --> 03:44:17.439 align:start position:0%
clinical opinion that it is well it's my
 
03:44:19.550 --> 03:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
clinical opinion that it isn't and there
 
03:44:22.910 --> 03:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
would be no way to really parse that out
 
03:44:26.429 --> 03:44:26.439 align:start position:0%
um so we're really trying to have ways
 
03:44:28.070 --> 03:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
to have oversight of things that are
 
03:44:29.550 --> 03:44:29.560 align:start position:0%
still allowing for that
 
03:44:32.269 --> 03:44:32.279 align:start position:0%
individualization of care okay hi
 
03:44:33.429 --> 03:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
Michelle Meritt I'm the president and
 
03:44:35.670 --> 03:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
CEO at new futures um so we were're
 
03:44:37.389 --> 03:44:37.399 align:start position:0%
working on this bill my colleague Jake
 
03:44:39.550 --> 03:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
has been the primary policy lead but he
 
03:44:41.309 --> 03:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
is at a national conference this week so
 
03:44:43.630 --> 03:44:43.640 align:start position:0%
I'm pinch hitting um the only point that
 
03:44:45.030 --> 03:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
I wanted to make is part of this
 
03:44:46.710 --> 03:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
conversation because it did come up a
 
03:44:48.149 --> 03:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
little bit is that there is a difference
 
03:44:50.510 --> 03:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
between the lure and certification of
 
03:44:52.469 --> 03:44:52.479 align:start position:0%
programs and individual counselors and
 
03:44:55.229 --> 03:44:55.239 align:start position:0%
also what insurance is going to cover um
 
03:44:57.910 --> 03:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
so programs May innovate and they may
 
03:45:01.389 --> 03:45:01.399 align:start position:0%
have you know really Advanced practices
 
03:45:04.309 --> 03:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
but there's no guarantee in any case
 
03:45:05.950 --> 03:45:05.960 align:start position:0%
that insurance or Medicaid are even
 
03:45:07.710 --> 03:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
going to cover it in the first place
 
03:45:09.790 --> 03:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
that may be something that is entirely
 
03:45:12.510 --> 03:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
self-pay um but it would not be stifled
 
03:45:14.750 --> 03:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
by virtue of what we are trying to do in
 
03:45:16.710 --> 03:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation they are two
 
03:45:19.189 --> 03:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
separate issues entirely what insurance
 
03:45:20.389 --> 03:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
is covering and what they're not
 
03:45:22.429 --> 03:45:22.439 align:start position:0%
covering so for example best practice
 
03:45:24.070 --> 03:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
would not necessarily be everyone in a
 
03:45:26.510 --> 03:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
28-day treatment program however we know
 
03:45:28.630 --> 03:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
that that's how Insurance works we also
 
03:45:30.389 --> 03:45:30.399 align:start position:0%
know that they do prior authorizations
 
03:45:32.269 --> 03:45:32.279 align:start position:0%
and utilization review on a schedule
 
03:45:34.149 --> 03:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
that does not match what the clinical
 
03:45:35.710 --> 03:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
indication is of a substance use
 
03:45:38.149 --> 03:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
disorder and put that onus on the
 
03:45:41.269 --> 03:45:41.279 align:start position:0%
providers to continuously redo them so
 
03:45:42.750 --> 03:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about two sort of
 
03:45:44.110 --> 03:45:44.120 align:start position:0%
different things and I just want to make
 
03:45:45.910 --> 03:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
sure that we're acknowledging that if
 
03:45:47.349 --> 03:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
there are things that are stifling
 
03:45:50.110 --> 03:45:50.120 align:start position:0%
Innovation it is not by virtue of lens
 
03:45:51.870 --> 03:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
share and certification that's happening
 
03:45:57.030 --> 03:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:01.349 --> 03:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:05.469 --> 03:46:05.479 align:start position:0%
information so I think with that we're
 
03:46:07.269 --> 03:46:07.279 align:start position:0%
going to lose representative Weber soon
 
03:46:08.070 --> 03:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
but I
 
03:46:11.389 --> 03:46:11.399 align:start position:0%
think so we talked a lot about oplc
 
03:46:14.510 --> 03:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
versus HHS we talked about you know do
 
03:46:17.149 --> 03:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
we go the the utsman or not and I think
 
03:46:19.630 --> 03:46:19.640 align:start position:0%
we cleared up a lot of that we can maybe
 
03:46:21.550 --> 03:46:21.560 align:start position:0%
let it stew in our minds a little bit
 
03:46:23.429 --> 03:46:23.439 align:start position:0%
and come back to it when we meet again
 
03:46:26.590 --> 03:46:26.600 align:start position:0%
but I would like to then you know having
 
03:46:28.070 --> 03:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
let's say we're going to go forward with
 
03:46:30.349 --> 03:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
this path you know where the HHS is
 
03:46:31.149 --> 03:46:31.159 align:start position:0%
going to
 
03:46:34.910 --> 03:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
certify um we really went in with some
 
03:46:36.469 --> 03:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
of the amended language which I think
 
03:46:39.349 --> 03:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
came from New futures um I think I
 
03:46:42.309 --> 03:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
handed out the amendment where we
 
03:46:45.670 --> 03:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
basically had cut everything down we got
 
03:46:48.229 --> 03:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
rid of the shall include but not limited
 
03:46:52.550 --> 03:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
to um so I just want to if everybody's
 
03:46:56.030 --> 03:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
okay just kind of look at these and you
 
03:46:58.550 --> 03:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
know make sure that within the scope of
 
03:47:02.389 --> 03:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
what we talked about earlier um this is
 
03:47:04.830 --> 03:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
what we want to cover
 
03:47:08.710 --> 03:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
um do we take stuff out do we put stuff
 
03:47:11.389 --> 03:47:11.399 align:start position:0%
in is it too comprehensive or not
 
03:47:14.229 --> 03:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
comprehensive enough so um I'd like to
 
03:47:16.110 --> 03:47:16.120 align:start position:0%
kind of open that up and did you want to
 
03:47:17.750 --> 03:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
say something yeah I'll just add that at
 
03:47:19.469 --> 03:47:19.479 align:start position:0%
the time in which new Futures was
 
03:47:21.590 --> 03:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
supporting um committee members around
 
03:47:23.189 --> 03:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
an amendment for this particular piece
 
03:47:23.199 --> 03:47:23.910 align:start position:0%
an amendment for this particular piece
of

03:47:23.910 --> 03:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:47:26.189 --> 03:47:26.199 align:start position:0%
legislation even what you see before you
 
03:47:27.950 --> 03:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
was not the ideal that we had wanted to
 
03:47:29.550 --> 03:47:29.560 align:start position:0%
put forward it was really to try to get
 
03:47:31.149 --> 03:47:31.159 align:start position:0%
a compromise that we could get something
 
03:47:32.550 --> 03:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
done this session because there was
 
03:47:34.469 --> 03:47:34.479 align:start position:0%
urgency in regulating these programs and
 
03:47:35.950 --> 03:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
we were Hearing in real time about
 
03:47:37.590 --> 03:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
individuals who were being harmed by
 
03:47:40.309 --> 03:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
programs that that DHS had no ability to
 
03:47:44.229 --> 03:47:44.239 align:start position:0%
regulate um my suggestion would be that
 
03:47:45.790 --> 03:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
The Advocates and others get together
 
03:47:48.189 --> 03:47:48.199 align:start position:0%
with DHHS and we take another look at
 
03:47:49.910 --> 03:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
the entirety of the bill and potentially
 
03:47:52.349 --> 03:47:52.359 align:start position:0%
even overhaul it so that we are directly
 
03:47:54.429 --> 03:47:54.439 align:start position:0%
addressing the set of issues that we've
 
03:47:57.309 --> 03:47:57.319 align:start position:0%
described here um
 
03:48:01.750 --> 03:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
and can I representative and and I'm I'm
 
03:48:03.149 --> 03:48:03.159 align:start position:0%
just going
 
03:48:05.590 --> 03:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
to I'm comfortable with what I have in
 
03:48:08.670 --> 03:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
front of me which has several layers of
 
03:48:11.149 --> 03:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
revisions um I think I think that
 
03:48:14.429 --> 03:48:14.439 align:start position:0%
starting with something that uh both
 
03:48:14.439 --> 03:48:15.309 align:start position:0%
starting with something that uh both
people

03:48:15.309 --> 03:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:48:17.269 --> 03:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
running the programs and the department
 
03:48:20.710 --> 03:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
think is workable is a very good idea um
 
03:48:24.110 --> 03:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to remind people that at
 
03:48:26.950 --> 03:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
least on the house side the windows of
 
03:48:28.830 --> 03:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity are very narrow and coming
 
03:48:32.510 --> 03:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
at us very quickly um and you know we
 
03:48:34.030 --> 03:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
will only have that window of
 
03:48:35.429 --> 03:48:35.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity in
 
03:48:38.429 --> 03:48:38.439 align:start position:0%
November um the Senate side there's a
 
03:48:43.070 --> 03:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
little more wiggle room but um you know
 
03:48:45.149 --> 03:48:45.159 align:start position:0%
I I just want to make sure we all have
 
03:48:47.429 --> 03:48:47.439 align:start position:0%
that in our minds as we're yeah we've
 
03:48:49.110 --> 03:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
been working in Partnership Department
 
03:48:50.950 --> 03:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services through the
 
03:48:55.910 --> 03:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
entirety of this so um I have no I guess
 
03:48:59.189 --> 03:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
hesitation at all or um concerns that we
 
03:49:00.429 --> 03:49:00.439 align:start position:0%
would not be able to come up with
 
03:49:02.389 --> 03:49:02.399 align:start position:0%
something that is mutually agreed upon
 
03:49:04.670 --> 03:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
so so Mr chairman could I make a
 
03:49:08.990 --> 03:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
suggestion which is yeah um my
 
03:49:11.349 --> 03:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
suggestion just because of the most
 
03:49:14.389 --> 03:49:14.399 align:start position:0%
immediate thing um I believe that our
 
03:49:17.670 --> 03:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
chair is thinking about uh a meeting of
 
03:49:20.670 --> 03:49:20.680 align:start position:0%
our full committee the week that is the
 
03:49:24.110 --> 03:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
veto day week which is coming at us very
 
03:49:27.790 --> 03:49:27.800 align:start position:0%
quickly um my suggestion was perhaps
 
03:49:29.870 --> 03:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
that we make a motion that this be
 
03:49:32.110 --> 03:49:32.120 align:start position:0%
recommended for further
 
03:49:35.030 --> 03:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
legislation and then we can certainly go
 
03:49:38.750 --> 03:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
on working on it from now till
 
03:49:41.910 --> 03:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
whenever um and and maybe try and nail
 
03:49:46.110 --> 03:49:46.120 align:start position:0%
down some of the specifics but um
 
03:49:49.189 --> 03:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
if if we at a minimum as a
 
03:49:51.510 --> 03:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee recommend it for further
 
03:49:54.269 --> 03:49:54.279 align:start position:0%
legislation that takes care of that one
 
03:49:56.830 --> 03:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
deadline we can talk to the committee
 
03:49:59.670 --> 03:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
about the lines along which we are
 
03:50:03.790 --> 03:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
thinking and I I think to me it sounds
 
03:50:07.349 --> 03:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
like what we have here is sort of a
 
03:50:10.030 --> 03:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
floor and then maybe there are other
 
03:50:15.030 --> 03:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
things that um people would prefer would
 
03:50:17.389 --> 03:50:17.399 align:start position:0%
like to see in there as well and I don't
 
03:50:19.110 --> 03:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
know whether that's one bill or two
 
03:50:22.389 --> 03:50:22.399 align:start position:0%
bills but it seems to me it gives us a
 
03:50:26.269 --> 03:50:26.279 align:start position:0%
lot to talk about going forward and
 
03:50:29.030 --> 03:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's filed as one bill or two
 
03:50:33.309 --> 03:50:33.319 align:start position:0%
bills is is for more
 
03:50:36.110 --> 03:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
discussion I I I was unaware that he was
 
03:50:39.990 --> 03:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
looking to do that on the 10th um so I
 
03:50:41.429 --> 03:50:41.439 align:start position:0%
hear what you're saying it's actually
 
03:50:43.790 --> 03:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
the 8th or the 9th the 8th or the 9th
 
03:50:46.790 --> 03:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
yeah so so however because the 10th is
 
03:50:49.830 --> 03:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
feed her day however I would like to
 
03:50:53.349 --> 03:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
because my my intention here is to have
 
03:50:56.229 --> 03:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
somebody hopefully who is going to get
 
03:50:59.149 --> 03:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
reelected from the subcommittee put in
 
03:51:02.990 --> 03:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
the language and I would like to have as
 
03:51:05.750 --> 03:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
much information to be able to vet that
 
03:51:08.710 --> 03:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
language when we come back on the 8th or
 
03:51:12.750 --> 03:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
the 9th and if I develop that language
 
03:51:15.389 --> 03:51:15.399 align:start position:0%
after that time we have something that
 
03:51:17.429 --> 03:51:17.439 align:start position:0%
we're comfortable with but we're not
 
03:51:19.910 --> 03:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
going to have the opportunity to test it
 
03:51:22.429 --> 03:51:22.439 align:start position:0%
until the new year and I because we we
 
03:51:24.309 --> 03:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
got we have very different opinions
 
03:51:26.710 --> 03:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
those of you who were around for the
 
03:51:29.590 --> 03:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
original hearings uh in the spring and
 
03:51:32.870 --> 03:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
so I really want to come back with as
 
03:51:35.990 --> 03:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
much of a direction as possible to to
 
03:51:39.429 --> 03:51:39.439 align:start position:0%
understand those folks that had concerns
 
03:51:41.269 --> 03:51:41.279 align:start position:0%
how far have we gone to addressing those
 
03:51:43.910 --> 03:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
concerns So when you say you folks are
 
03:51:46.070 --> 03:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
close I mean how close are we if I was
 
03:51:49.790 --> 03:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
to I'm going away next week on holiday
 
03:51:52.389 --> 03:51:52.399 align:start position:0%
but I'll be back the following week
 
03:51:53.830 --> 03:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
would would would that give you enough
 
03:51:55.550 --> 03:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
time to be able to say hey I have
 
03:51:57.349 --> 03:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
something that we could bring
 
03:52:01.670 --> 03:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
back do you think well I'm just going to
 
03:52:03.429 --> 03:52:03.439 align:start position:0%
point out that the the the committee
 
03:52:06.550 --> 03:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
will not vote on the full language the
 
03:52:08.710 --> 03:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
committee only votes on recommend for
 
03:52:12.630 --> 03:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
further legislation or not so it doesn't
 
03:52:14.510 --> 03:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
matter as much as far as I'm concerned
 
03:52:16.750 --> 03:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
concerned that we actually have the
 
03:52:19.670 --> 03:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
language sitting in front of us because
 
03:52:21.110 --> 03:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's not what we vote on as a
 
03:52:24.030 --> 03:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
committee at this point I I but I
 
03:52:26.750 --> 03:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
understand that wanting the concept and
 
03:52:30.309 --> 03:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
also wanting to address certain of the
 
03:52:32.750 --> 03:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
issues that we know are going to come up
 
03:52:34.710 --> 03:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
particularly the issue of is this going
 
03:52:37.750 --> 03:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
to stifle Innovation is this going to
 
03:52:41.469 --> 03:52:41.479 align:start position:0%
prevent people from trying new things or
 
03:52:43.670 --> 03:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
to emphasize a particular kind of
 
03:52:47.269 --> 03:52:47.279 align:start position:0%
program with a particular sort of client
 
03:52:50.670 --> 03:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
um those are things that I feel more
 
03:52:53.710 --> 03:52:53.720 align:start position:0%
comfortable about having discuss them
 
03:52:55.830 --> 03:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
even if I don't have the specifics in
 
03:53:01.990 --> 03:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
front of me um and and um I I
 
03:53:04.750 --> 03:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
think it's it's just a matter of the
 
03:53:09.349 --> 03:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
time frame and what we get when but um
 
03:53:11.510 --> 03:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's not going to be the job of the
 
03:53:15.030 --> 03:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
committee on whatever day the committee
 
03:53:18.870 --> 03:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
meets as a full committee to Wordsmith a
 
03:53:22.469 --> 03:53:22.479 align:start position:0%
a a full Amendment or or a new bill I I
 
03:53:24.550 --> 03:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
I agree with that I was just hoping to
 
03:53:29.030 --> 03:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
have as as much of a vision as possible
 
03:53:31.630 --> 03:53:31.640 align:start position:0%
you know for the committee well I I mean
 
03:53:32.990 --> 03:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
I'll just do a quick straw P the
 
03:53:34.630 --> 03:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
committee members do do you think it's
 
03:53:37.030 --> 03:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
worth it to come back again before that
 
03:53:40.550 --> 03:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
because I do believe I'm comfortable I
 
03:53:43.630 --> 03:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
have enough information to recommend um
 
03:53:45.710 --> 03:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
for future leg legislation I I think we
 
03:53:48.189 --> 03:53:48.199 align:start position:0%
talked through uh the questions about
 
03:53:50.469 --> 03:53:50.479 align:start position:0%
the Innovation the fact that you know
 
03:53:52.389 --> 03:53:52.399 align:start position:0%
we're migrating in the areas that are
 
03:53:54.269 --> 03:53:54.279 align:start position:0%
covered by Medicaid makes me feel very
 
03:53:56.229 --> 03:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
confident and this legislation is going
 
03:53:59.429 --> 03:53:59.439 align:start position:0%
to be closely mirroring that um so a lot
 
03:54:00.870 --> 03:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
of those things are there so I'm
 
03:54:03.429 --> 03:54:03.439 align:start position:0%
comfortable um but I I'll just do a
 
03:54:05.550 --> 03:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
quick straw pull of you folks do you
 
03:54:07.469 --> 03:54:07.479 align:start position:0%
think there's value in coming back one
 
03:54:09.830 --> 03:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
more time before we go back to the whole
 
03:54:14.910 --> 03:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
committee or what are your thoughts um
 
03:54:16.269 --> 03:54:16.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to give you my thoughts on
 
03:54:19.550 --> 03:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:22.870 --> 03:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
okay you don't need a mic
 
03:54:26.550 --> 03:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
Joe first thing is that um in in this
 
03:54:30.990 --> 03:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
amended by the Senate bill that we have
 
03:54:33.910 --> 03:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
um I didn't read it through before so I
 
03:54:35.630 --> 03:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm missing it but and I'm sorry
 
03:54:37.590 --> 03:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
Joe I'm going to interrupt because I I
 
03:54:39.630 --> 03:54:39.640 align:start position:0%
do actually have to be on a meeting at
 
03:54:42.710 --> 03:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
to um I think it would be very
 
03:54:44.750 --> 03:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
productive to come back but I'm out of
 
03:54:46.149 --> 03:54:46.159 align:start position:0%
time because I'm going to be gone for
 
03:54:49.189 --> 03:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
two weeks starting in um I'm gone from
 
03:54:50.870 --> 03:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
the 20th to the
 
03:54:55.550 --> 03:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
5th um just so you know uh but that
 
03:54:57.269 --> 03:54:57.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean you can't meet without me
 
03:54:59.710 --> 03:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly my my vote is in favor of
 
03:55:01.510 --> 03:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
recommend that we recommend to the full
 
03:55:03.349 --> 03:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
committee recommend for future
 
03:55:05.149 --> 03:55:05.159 align:start position:0%
legislation but with that I'm going to
 
03:55:07.309 --> 03:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
have to run and I beg your pardon for
 
03:55:09.229 --> 03:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
the interruption that's your vote okay
 
03:55:10.990 --> 03:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much good luck so I'm
 
03:55:14.510 --> 03:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
just going to say that um I'm not sure
 
03:55:18.630 --> 03:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
you know you mentioned that in terms of
 
03:55:21.429 --> 03:55:21.439 align:start position:0%
actually um being able to implement this
 
03:55:22.950 --> 03:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
there would be certain cost to the
 
03:55:24.670 --> 03:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
department and I'm not sure that those
 
03:55:27.389 --> 03:55:27.399 align:start position:0%
are represented in here in any way so I
 
03:55:28.870 --> 03:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
think that's something
 
03:55:31.670 --> 03:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
that eventually when a new bill is
 
03:55:35.189 --> 03:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
brought forward should be clearly
 
03:55:37.469 --> 03:55:37.479 align:start position:0%
represented we did submit a detailed
 
03:55:39.630 --> 03:55:39.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on this bill last session
 
03:55:40.990 --> 03:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
and so we have those costs at our
 
03:55:42.429 --> 03:55:42.439 align:start position:0%
fingertips if you'd like us to send them
 
03:55:45.349 --> 03:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
to the committee the the Amendment uh
 
03:55:47.389 --> 03:55:47.399 align:start position:0%
included subject to available funding
 
03:55:49.149 --> 03:55:49.159 align:start position:0%
which then made it somewhat fiscal
 
03:55:52.429 --> 03:55:52.439 align:start position:0%
neutral but it's not it's just whether
 
03:55:55.389 --> 03:55:55.399 align:start position:0%
or not we have the funding okay I'm not
 
03:55:56.750 --> 03:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not running so I'm not going to be
 
03:55:58.110 --> 03:55:58.120 align:start position:0%
here but I just think that that's one of
 
03:56:01.790 --> 03:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
the missing pieces I I'm in favor of
 
03:56:01.800 --> 03:56:04.590 align:start position:0%
the missing pieces I I'm in favor of
voting

03:56:04.590 --> 03:56:04.600 align:start position:0%
voting
 
03:56:09.429 --> 03:56:09.439 align:start position:0%
um for um recommend I'm in favor of
 
03:56:12.670 --> 03:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
recommending that this bill um comes
 
03:56:14.990 --> 03:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
forward in the next session
 
03:56:16.950 --> 03:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
um and I don't I don't personally feel
 
03:56:18.910 --> 03:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
the need to come again to kind of work
 
03:56:22.750 --> 03:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
on the details of it um I think in the
 
03:56:22.760 --> 03:56:24.229 align:start position:0%
on the details of it um I think in the
original

03:56:24.229 --> 03:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
original
 
03:56:29.149 --> 03:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
session it was so cloudy somehow um that
 
03:56:31.670 --> 03:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
people were asking well does this mean
 
03:56:33.309 --> 03:56:33.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
03:56:35.910 --> 03:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
regulate um Alcoholics Anonymous for
 
03:56:39.790 --> 03:56:39.800 align:start position:0%
instance and I think that um more than
 
03:56:42.830 --> 03:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
changing anything I think we've well as
 
03:56:44.830 --> 03:56:44.840 align:start position:0%
well as changing some things we've
 
03:56:48.349 --> 03:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
become clear on what this bill would do
 
03:56:50.590 --> 03:56:50.600 align:start position:0%
and what it wouldn't do so I feel
 
03:56:54.149 --> 03:56:54.159 align:start position:0%
comfortable in recommending it for
 
03:56:57.630 --> 03:56:57.640 align:start position:0%
um being reintroduced and having people
 
03:56:59.429 --> 03:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
who were very involved in it continue to
 
03:57:00.750 --> 03:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
work on
 
03:57:03.429 --> 03:57:03.439 align:start position:0%
that so
 
03:57:06.630 --> 03:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
um I think we lost representative Weber
 
03:57:11.750 --> 03:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
um so I think um do do do we with a
 
03:57:13.950 --> 03:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of five if we want to take
 
03:57:16.030 --> 03:57:16.040 align:start position:0%
a vote to recommend for interim study to
 
03:57:17.990 --> 03:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
take that to the whole committee do we
 
03:57:20.870 --> 03:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
need to make that decision here or can
 
03:57:23.670 --> 03:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
we have that discussion when we go into
 
03:57:25.550 --> 03:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
the uh the committee as a whole in
 
03:57:27.550 --> 03:57:27.560 align:start position:0%
October I think we make it in the
 
03:57:30.189 --> 03:57:30.199 align:start position:0%
committee not here okay I I think I mean
 
03:57:31.990 --> 03:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
we can do something informal here but I
 
03:57:35.229 --> 03:57:35.239 align:start position:0%
think it so representative King what are
 
03:57:35.239 --> 03:57:35.950 align:start position:0%
think it so representative King what are
your

03:57:35.950 --> 03:57:35.960 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:57:38.870 --> 03:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
thoughts so uh to to answer your last
 
03:57:41.110 --> 03:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
question before I go on to my thoughts
 
03:57:44.630 --> 03:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm not
 
03:57:49.269 --> 03:57:49.279 align:start position:0%
uh an expert on how committees run but I
 
03:57:51.070 --> 03:57:51.080 align:start position:0%
think there was four of us here that
 
03:57:54.710 --> 03:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
were and are in favor of moving forward
 
03:57:57.710 --> 03:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
with this with uh representative Weber
 
03:57:59.510 --> 03:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
making her thoughts known before she
 
03:58:02.910 --> 03:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
left so I think we have and besides that
 
03:58:06.429 --> 03:58:06.439 align:start position:0%
three out of five I think makes it quum
 
03:58:09.870 --> 03:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
anyway so so are you then of the same
 
03:58:11.870 --> 03:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
opinion that you you you know what you
 
03:58:15.469 --> 03:58:15.479 align:start position:0%
need to know um from from what I've
 
03:58:18.030 --> 03:58:18.040 align:start position:0%
heard this is a little different than
 
03:58:22.269 --> 03:58:22.279 align:start position:0%
what I've understood before and this it
 
03:58:24.469 --> 03:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
makes sense I I'm I'm with
 
03:58:26.309 --> 03:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro that we really
 
03:58:29.070 --> 03:58:29.080 align:start position:0%
need to be clear on what we're
 
03:58:31.070 --> 03:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
regulating I think that was the big
 
03:58:32.950 --> 03:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
problem we had back in the spring when
 
03:58:37.469 --> 03:58:37.479 align:start position:0%
we heard this bill was uh you know uh
 
03:58:39.750 --> 03:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
are we going to have people just uh
 
03:58:43.389 --> 03:58:43.399 align:start position:0%
taking over and trying to control things
 
03:58:47.070 --> 03:58:47.080 align:start position:0%
and um um and from what I heard today
 
03:58:50.790 --> 03:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
that's not the case so I'm I'm in favor
 
03:58:53.229 --> 03:58:53.239 align:start position:0%
of moving forward the other
 
03:58:57.870 --> 03:58:57.880 align:start position:0%
clarification that I need is uh is the
 
03:59:00.510 --> 03:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
language that is being written is this
 
03:59:02.630 --> 03:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
03:59:05.469 --> 03:59:05.479 align:start position:0%
DHHS it's my understanding it's being
 
03:59:07.469 --> 03:59:07.479 align:start position:0%
DHHS been working in conjunction with
 
03:59:12.670 --> 03:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
new Futures on it so okay so um just
 
03:59:14.429 --> 03:59:14.439 align:start position:0%
before we move on we have the the
 
03:59:15.830 --> 03:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
chairman of the Comm committee as a
 
03:59:18.309 --> 03:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
whole and so you when we planning to get
 
03:59:19.630 --> 03:59:19.640 align:start position:0%
everybody together to take up these
 
03:59:22.070 --> 03:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
interim study bills Mr
 
03:59:24.670 --> 03:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
chair um I I conferred with
 
03:59:26.670 --> 03:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
representative Weber the ranking member
 
03:59:29.189 --> 03:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
of our committee uh we're tentatively
 
03:59:32.830 --> 03:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
looking at October 9th right now
 
03:59:32.840 --> 03:59:36.149 align:start position:0%
looking at October 9th right now
um

03:59:36.149 --> 03:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:38.550 --> 03:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm meeting with staff this
 
03:59:40.630 --> 03:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
afternoon to see we have 13 interim
 
03:59:42.309 --> 03:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
study bills
 
03:59:45.030 --> 03:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
and um seeing if there's any interest in
 
03:59:46.389 --> 03:59:46.399 align:start position:0%
any other subcommittees there's only
 
03:59:48.389 --> 03:59:48.399 align:start position:0%
been two real subcommittees one one
 
03:59:50.309 --> 03:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
Function One met this morning and this
 
03:59:53.790 --> 03:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
one and um so right now we're looking at
 
03:59:55.189 --> 03:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
at least one meeting occurring on
 
03:59:57.269 --> 03:59:57.279 align:start position:0%
October 9th I know there's another
 
03:59:58.870 --> 03:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
meeting that afternoon if we don't get
 
04:00:02.070 --> 04:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
through everything then then um and I'll
 
04:00:04.189 --> 04:00:04.199 align:start position:0%
have we'll have a subsequent meeting
 
04:00:05.550 --> 04:00:05.560 align:start position:0%
everything has to be wrapped up before
 
04:00:07.990 --> 04:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
October 25th on interum study
 
04:00:11.110 --> 04:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
reports so thanks to that so I think
 
04:00:15.389 --> 04:00:15.399 align:start position:0%
with that being said um if it's okay
 
04:00:18.030 --> 04:00:18.040 align:start position:0%
with the rest of the committee we'll
 
04:00:19.750 --> 04:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
we'll go forward when when the
 
04:00:21.229 --> 04:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
committee's a whole meets will'll come
 
04:00:25.870 --> 04:00:25.880 align:start position:0%
in we'll recommend um but um with that
 
04:00:29.149 --> 04:00:29.159 align:start position:0%
in mind uh would it be
 
04:00:34.389 --> 04:00:34.399 align:start position:0%
possible to get that newly amended
 
04:00:37.149 --> 04:00:37.159 align:start position:0%
language within that timeline because I
 
04:00:38.750 --> 04:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
I would like to have an opportunity to
 
04:00:41.550 --> 04:00:41.560 align:start position:0%
review it to send it out to the other
 
04:00:44.630 --> 04:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
members of the subcommittee um so at
 
04:00:46.269 --> 04:00:46.279 align:start position:0%
least you know even if we're not getting
 
04:00:47.670 --> 04:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
back together they've had a chance to
 
04:00:49.429 --> 04:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
look at it so how's that timeline work
 
04:00:50.910 --> 04:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
for you yeah new Futures has a really
 
04:00:53.469 --> 04:00:53.479 align:start position:0%
good working relationship with DHHS so
 
04:00:55.510 --> 04:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sure within that time frame we can
 
04:00:57.389 --> 04:00:57.399 align:start position:0%
get together and come up with some
 
04:01:00.389 --> 04:01:00.399 align:start position:0%
Amendment language um and get that back
 
04:01:00.399 --> 04:01:02.790 align:start position:0%
Amendment language um and get that back
to

04:01:02.790 --> 04:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:05.349 --> 04:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
you so with that being said does anybody
 
04:01:06.830 --> 04:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
have anything else they want to add
 
04:01:09.590 --> 04:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative King yeah for the for the
 
04:01:12.110 --> 04:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
minutes I wanted to put what date that
 
04:01:15.990 --> 04:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
was going to be is that
 
04:01:19.149 --> 04:01:19.159 align:start position:0%
October uh 8th the full committee
 
04:01:21.670 --> 04:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
meeting or the deadline for inter
 
04:01:24.750 --> 04:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
study uh and again what I'm probably
 
04:01:26.149 --> 04:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
going to do is send an email to the
 
04:01:28.269 --> 04:01:28.279 align:start position:0%
committee we do need to make sure we're
 
04:01:29.590 --> 04:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
going to have a quorum on that dat about
 
04:01:31.870 --> 04:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
October 9th is the date I'm looking at
 
04:01:35.389 --> 04:01:35.399 align:start position:0%
okay probably a 9:30 start date and U I
 
04:01:37.870 --> 04:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
know there's a democratic caucus at 3
 
04:01:40.790 --> 04:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
that day so we' try to wrap up by 2:30
 
04:01:43.389 --> 04:01:43.399 align:start position:0%
if not before so people can ideally grab
 
04:01:44.590 --> 04:01:44.600 align:start position:0%
some lunch
 
04:01:46.189 --> 04:01:46.199 align:start position:0%
and if we're making slow progress we'll
 
04:01:47.670 --> 04:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
probably have to adjourn and continue
 
04:01:49.710 --> 04:01:49.720 align:start position:0%
everything to another day but my thought
 
04:01:51.870 --> 04:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
it was would the notice would probably
 
04:01:54.349 --> 04:01:54.359 align:start position:0%
read a full committee work session and
 
04:01:56.030 --> 04:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
subsequent executive session on all
 
04:01:59.189 --> 04:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
bills that that would be the goal and um
 
04:02:01.309 --> 04:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
and again as representative Weber has
 
04:02:03.070 --> 04:02:03.080 align:start position:0%
pointed out earlier today and I don't
 
04:02:04.910 --> 04:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
know if she did at this
 
04:02:07.389 --> 04:02:07.399 align:start position:0%
meeting the only thing the full
 
04:02:08.590 --> 04:02:08.600 align:start position:0%
committee is going to be able to do is
 
04:02:10.510 --> 04:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
either recommend for future legislation
 
04:02:12.910 --> 04:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
or not recommend uh none of this is
 
04:02:14.550 --> 04:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
going to go to the floor this point it's
 
04:02:16.030 --> 04:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
going to have to come forward as a new
 
04:02:19.269 --> 04:02:19.279 align:start position:0%
bill in the next uh next term so so yeah
 
04:02:21.189 --> 04:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
October 9th and then the ultimate
 
04:02:23.630 --> 04:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
deadline for all interterm study is
 
04:02:23.640 --> 04:02:25.790 align:start position:0%
deadline for all interterm study is
October

04:02:25.790 --> 04:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
October
 
04:02:28.349 --> 04:02:28.359 align:start position:0%
25th thank you is so is that everything
 
04:02:30.950 --> 04:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
that you need then you're all set um
 
04:02:35.030 --> 04:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
here's the tricky one who who moved it
 
04:02:38.950 --> 04:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:41.750 --> 04:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
it with there was some discussion when
 
04:02:43.149 --> 04:02:43.159 align:start position:0%
you were out of the room about whether
 
04:02:46.469 --> 04:02:46.479 align:start position:0%
we take a formal vote here or do we or
 
04:02:49.349 --> 04:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
do we just bring it to the discuss it
 
04:02:51.710 --> 04:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
informally and have an informal vote and
 
04:02:54.710 --> 04:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
then bring it to the full committee yeah
 
04:02:56.389 --> 04:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
so we're not going to take a vote today
 
04:02:57.950 --> 04:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
we're we're going to just bring it forth
 
04:03:00.469 --> 04:03:00.479 align:start position:0%
to the the committee discuss it do we
 
04:03:04.910 --> 04:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
need someone who um makes a motion and a
 
04:03:07.830 --> 04:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
second well I think I think for the um
 
04:03:09.910 --> 04:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
for the committee to consider what what
 
04:03:12.070 --> 04:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
happened here it would be nice to have a
 
04:03:13.790 --> 04:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
formal sense of what the committee wants
 
04:03:15.469 --> 04:03:15.479 align:start position:0%
to do whether you want to do it as a
 
04:03:17.349 --> 04:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
vote or want to just gauge if there's
 
04:03:19.790 --> 04:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
any formal objection or whatever it
 
04:03:21.870 --> 04:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
would be good to know the a a formal
 
04:03:23.269 --> 04:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
sense of what this committee the
 
04:03:25.389 --> 04:03:25.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee wanted to do what wants to
 
04:03:27.269 --> 04:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
recommend that's right so then I'll make
 
04:03:31.030 --> 04:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
a recommendation uh for
 
04:03:34.269 --> 04:03:34.279 align:start position:0%
uh uh submit for future
 
04:03:37.070 --> 04:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
legislation I'll
 
04:03:39.670 --> 04:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
second and I think um I think
 
04:03:42.269 --> 04:03:42.279 align:start position:0%
representative Weber um retroactively
 
04:03:44.110 --> 04:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
voted for
 
04:03:47.030 --> 04:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
but but she's not here so let's let's
 
04:03:52.229 --> 04:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
let's let's keep it legal so um so uh
 
04:03:56.830 --> 04:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
all in favor say I I opposed good so
 
04:03:59.149 --> 04:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
with that being said um I just want to
 
04:04:01.149 --> 04:04:01.159 align:start position:0%
thank everybody for coming out members
 
04:04:03.590 --> 04:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
of the committee and and you folks like
 
04:04:05.309 --> 04:04:05.319 align:start position:0%
I said a lot of questions a lot of push
 
04:04:07.189 --> 04:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
back but I think it's important because
 
04:04:09.309 --> 04:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of push back from the
 
04:04:11.389 --> 04:04:11.399 align:start position:0%
folks of the committee as a whole and so
 
04:04:12.550 --> 04:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
some of the questions we've been
 
04:04:14.750 --> 04:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
answering I think will go a long way
 
04:04:16.070 --> 04:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
towards addressing some of those
 
04:04:18.070 --> 04:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
concerns so I really appreciate
 
04:04:19.910 --> 04:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
everybody taking the time out to come in
 
04:04:22.510 --> 04:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
and talk with us and with that um this
 
04:04:24.750 --> 04:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
hearing is adjourned thank
 
04:04:26.429 --> 04:04:26.439 align:start position:0%
you thank
