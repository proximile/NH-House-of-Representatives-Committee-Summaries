00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
tax only that began in July of 2018 18
 
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
this tax is not a cascading credit if
 
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know what I mean by that so uh it
 
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
may be taken against the business
 
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
profits tax or the business Enterprise
 
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
tax or the interest in dividends tax but
 
00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
a credit taken against the business
 
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax is not
 
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
treated as tax paid for purposes of the
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
business profits
 
00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 align:start position:0%
tax um last year 118 taxpayers um used
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
the credit to offset a tax liability of
 
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 align:start position:0%
one of the three taxes for a total of
 
00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 align:start position:0%
credit uh thank you you don't have that
 
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
in a form that you could pass out to us
 
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 align:start position:0%
do you I didn't bring it with me but it
 
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
is on the website and I can send it via
 
00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 align:start position:0%
email so everyone has a copy if that'd
 
00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
be helpful okay that would be helpful um
 
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
how does 2 million 256,000 in credits
 
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
compared to the last two or three years
 
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh in 2022 the credits were a million
 
00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:44.199 align:start position:0%
545,000 in 2021 they were a,
 
00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:55.869 --> 00:06:55.879 align:start position:0%
372,000 okay so um do we know is there
 
00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
any particular reason why in in 23 it it
 
00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
jumped up so
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
high there's not a reason that I'm aware
 
00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
of for the reason for the jump the
 
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
um the interest in dividends tax
 
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
provision was added in 2018 so it
 
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a the addition of the tax
 
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
of question yes thank you but there
 
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
seems to be a a a consistency the how
 
00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 align:start position:0%
how about the number of people that are
 
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
using this credit the number of people
 
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
that are using the credit seems to have
 
00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:34.919 align:start position:0%
stayed fairly stable so it was 110 in
 
00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:41.479 align:start position:0%
2020 116 in 20121 and 120 in 2022
 
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
compared to 118 last year so you you got
 
00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:48.039 align:start position:0%
a A Very consistent patent here in terms
 
00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:50.919 align:start position:0%
and which tax are they are they using it
 
00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
against so they they can use the credit
 
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
against any of the three taxes yes I
 
00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
don't have the detail on which tax um
 
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
specifically was comprises the
 
00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
2,256 million uh 20 2,
 
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
256,000 but I can get that and provide
 
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
that as well for the F the question yeah
 
00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
yeah sure yeah that's that so so this
 
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
could be an individual or a
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
business correct okay thank you thank
 
00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:22.319 align:start position:0%

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:32.599 align:start position:0%
your mic isn't
 
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:38.200 align:start position:0%

you besides this financial information
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
information does uh Dr have any other
 
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
information about how
 
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
the the scholarship money that results
 
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
from the donations that lie behind this
 
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.470 align:start position:0%
from the donations that lie behind this
um

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
are um being Prov who's getting them
 
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
what the performances is there any any
 
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
information Beyond this financial
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
information that Dr
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
collects I I would again need to double
 
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
check there is a list of qualified
 
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
scholarship programs I believe in order
 
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
for a taxpayer to claim the credit they
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
have to disclose the scholarship program
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
that the donation was made to I don't
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
know if we compile the statistics on
 
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
which programs are receiving the
 
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
majority of the donations it's
 
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:31.640 align:start position:0%
information we probably have I don't
 
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
know if it's in information we could
 
00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
disclose due to the confidentiality
 
00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:39.320 align:start position:0%
obligations that we have I I um I
 
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:44.200 align:start position:0%
believe it is true that um Department of
 
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
Education I could be wrong about this uh
 
00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:49.399 align:start position:0%
it collects data has
 
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:53.560 align:start position:0%
data that um does provide some of that
 
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
information about who the the kids are
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
um and where they're going uh um what uh
 
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
particular schools or categories of
 
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
schools I think they're actually named
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
um are out there and um so I I think I
 
00:10:13.949 --> 00:10:13.959 align:start position:0%
just apparently Dr doesn't have this
 
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
information we've got to ask about it uh
 
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
because I think one of our obligations
 
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
here is to look at the purposes of these
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
credits and to see whether they're uh as
 
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
used uh for helping to to further that
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
stated purpose I had uh uh Kate Baker
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
scheduled she's the chair of the
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund to be here I'm hoping
 
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
that she arrives soon because those are
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
questions she may be able to answer um I
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
noticed Jennifer just walked out of the
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
room but I she maybe she could contact
 
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.269 align:start position:0%
room but I she maybe she could contact
her

00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
her
 
00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
um in the meantime are there other
 
00:10:57.079 --> 00:11:04.990 align:start position:0%
um in the meantime are there other
questions

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
this is an underservice fund at this
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
point right it's C at $6 million with
 
00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:12.200 align:start position:0%
allowing a carry to forward each year um
 
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
but and but the annual is $5 million but
 
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
we're not anywhere near that at this
 
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
point yeah the annual cap is
 
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
5,00,000 and we're the people have not
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
utilized H you know less than half the
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
y pa again the the the fund
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't this only applies to the people
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
that actually take it so even though we
 
00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:42.519 align:start position:0%
earmark up to $5 million the fact that
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
we only had $2.2
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
million that's all that's an effect that
 
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
is $2.2 million on the business interest
 
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
the business taxes or the interest in
 
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
dividends taxes no we don't take the
 
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
full $5 million out only the amount of
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
credits actually issued that's correct
 
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
we we report and the statistic that I
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
provided you is the amount of
 
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
um potential tax that was foregone
 
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
um do we I guess this is a copy of what
 
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
you have that we have now
 
00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:31.399 align:start position:0%
sorry correct and I think the the
 
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
information I just provided you I think
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:47.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so the cap is 5 million and we're
 
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
one two three four we have four years of
 
00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.750 align:start position:0%
one two three four we have four years of
data

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839 align:start position:0%
here even the highest year not even
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:10.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
um right now we're trying to reach uh
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
okay okay to answer she said she had it
 
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
on the wrong calendar date I'm trying to
 
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
find out if she's gonna if she's in
 
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
conquering and come over or she is out
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
of the out of the town and can't make it
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
I will say this to I just did a quick
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh she's going to head here right now
 
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
office confence oh what does that mean
 
00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:40.790 align:start position:0%
office confence oh what does that mean
10

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
minutes if she can come it certainly
 
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
saves us the potential of having another
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
meeting what's that she says she's in
 
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
her office I think her office is here in
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
conquer I don't know and if it is then
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
she's on her
 
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
way she's has an answer me back second
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
okay I just did I asked her like within
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
the next 15 minutes and I'm waiting to

see if she answers me she said she can
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
head here now she's in her office but I
 
00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:10.759 align:start position:0%

for others on the progress of this
 
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
program over the
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
years um and what I uh was trying to get
 
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
at but we really um didn't needed help
 
00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh um
 
00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.150 align:start position:0%
uh um
[Music]

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
was looking behind the the
 
00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.990 align:start position:0%
was looking behind the the
numbers

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.310 align:start position:0%
numbers
to

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
what's actually happening um as I look
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
look uh I'm wondering whether you've got
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
an audit program or whether there's any
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh way of checking on whether expenses
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
that are charged this program are within
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
the Ambit or something things that are
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
excluded by Statute from that's right
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
yeah you can't use this program for
 
00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
transportation right or the parents time
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
in homeschooling um if you notice from
 
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
the list in the department of revenue
 
00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
report this is a predominantly School
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
tuition program where the family applies
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
to a particular private school the
 
00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
private school tells us the tuition the
 
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
family owes and then we calculate a
 
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship at after that on the rest of
 
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
their tuition Due based on the Family's
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
income depending on what bracket they
 
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
fit in so our lowest income families
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
those um free lunch income level
 
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
families will get a 75% scholarship
 
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
based on the tuition that they
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
owe after their school financial aid so
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
imagine you're going to a little lowcost
 
00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:53.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know montauri school and the
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
tuition is six
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
$6,000 and you f into that 75% bracket
 
00:37:02.109 --> 00:37:02.119 align:start position:0%
or let me just do 50% bracket so it's
 
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
easy for my mind and the school has no
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
internal financial aid you're going to
 
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
get a scholarship from us to cover half
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
of that tuition or
 
00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
$3,000 remember the Department of
 
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue well the legislature set in this
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
law some caps for the scholarships so
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
the average of all the scholarships
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
together has to be under about $3,000 is
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
what the cap is it started at about 27
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
00 and it's been increasing by CPI every
 
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
year and so the average scholarship is
 
00:37:36.349 --> 00:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
about $3,000 per kid remember and that's
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
all lumped together and we calculate
 
00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:41.240 align:start position:0%
them individually based on the students
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
need it works wonderfully we've come in
 
00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
under the cap every year because we have
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
a diverse group of families that range
 
00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
from you know very very low income to
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
more moderate income remember this
 
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
program's income limits are 300% of the
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
poverty line or below so it's targeted
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
to really low and moderate income
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
families that have more tuition needs
 
00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
than this school can
 
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
support uh to follow up uh what
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
information do you have that tells you
 
00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
and that uh we could learn about the
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
performance of
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
students um who
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
are um helped by the aid under this
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
program so usually it's by looking at
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
the performance of the schools so if you
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
look at these little private schools in
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for example if you take
 
00:38:35.069 --> 00:38:35.079 align:start position:0%
the Catholic schools as an example the
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
kids in those schools average about 85th
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
percentile at grade level or above so
 
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
those private schools look very similar
 
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
to what the town of Bedford looks like
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
in their academic achievement scores so
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
the department of Ed collects those
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
scores or the schools put them on their
 
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
websites but that's how you would know
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
what the children are doing in the
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
choosing you know the department of Ed
 
00:39:04.349 --> 00:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
monitors the private schools and
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
approves them for activities to
 
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
exist Does the Department of Education
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
have any monitoring responsibilities
 
00:39:15.069 --> 00:39:15.079 align:start position:0%
with with respect to this program this
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
is monitored by the Department of
 
00:39:20.589 --> 00:39:20.599 align:start position:0%
Revenue only yes I see well the
 
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has only the
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
perview over so remember this program
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
originally was designed for what they
 
00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.390 align:start position:0%
originally was designed for what they
call

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
call
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
switchers kids going from public school
 
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
to private school the department of
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
education does verify those scids to
 
00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
make sure that the children meet that
 
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:41.720 align:start position:0%
requirement and it's a certain
 
00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
percentage of the students in the group
 
00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
that have to be going from public to
 
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
private and I think again the
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
legislature created it that way so it
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
would be Revenue
 
00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
neutral you know they would know that
 
00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:56.359 align:start position:0%
there's a cost savings for those kids to
 
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
offset any minus from the tax credit
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
that you guys see yes yeah so they do
 
00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
oversee that
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
piece I'll leave it at that thank you
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
questions questions well I have a
 
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
question just to comment I'm looking at
 
00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
this department of Ed form whatever the
 
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
number is Department of Revenue the ed5
 
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the Department of Revenue
 
00:40:24.109 --> 00:40:24.119 align:start position:0%
that's a report we file annually with
 
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue they're
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
actually on that website Department of
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
revenues website all the way back to
 
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
2013 you can see the from when we
 
00:40:35.309 --> 00:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
started with a whole what 50 kids I
 
00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:38.200 align:start position:0%
think yeah so so for me when I'm looking
 
00:40:39.309 --> 00:40:39.319 align:start position:0%
at this we're talking about one of the
 
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
reasons where we have this committee
 
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
meeting is talk about the efficacy how
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
how efficient how how is it being used
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
is it is it good for the State of New
 
00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:48.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the citizens of the State
 
00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:50.079 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and I'm drawn on page
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
three to specifically the last two
 
00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
questions enf on this form and it says
 
00:40:58.109 --> 00:40:58.119 align:start position:0%
you know my child seen measurable
 
00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
improvements in academic achievement
 
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
right out of roughly 1100 people that
 
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
responded over a thousand of them
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
strongly agree or agree that their child
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
seeing academic Improvement and then I
 
00:41:11.309 --> 00:41:11.319 align:start position:0%
look at F you know my child would not be
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
able to attend the school of his or her
 
00:41:15.309 --> 00:41:15.319 align:start position:0%
choice without this credit program and
 
00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
again out of roughly 1100 students over
 
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
a thousand are saying without this
 
00:41:22.109 --> 00:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
program my kid couldn't have that
 
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
academic performance that they're seeing
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
so as a general rule I I just think that
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
this is doing exactly what we intended
 
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
it to do right we want to provide choice
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
to allow kids that were being challenged
 
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
in public schools to have an opportunity
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing exactly by the
 
00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
responses of the citizens the parents
 
00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
who have these kids in the schools that
 
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
this is in fact functioning as we
 
00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
intended so well and I know too the
 
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
people that are donating to the program
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
and utilizing the credit are very
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
pleased that they can direct you know
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
their tax dollars specifically to
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
children's education I know that's
 
00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
something that's really important to the
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
people contributing the in fact new
 
00:42:04.829 --> 00:42:04.839 align:start position:0%
money right this is money that otherwise
 
00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily go to education
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
these are donors saying I would like my
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
money to go to education making a
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
donation and using the credit um I know
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
that that for them is a very important
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
piece of this that they're having the
 
00:42:20.549 --> 00:42:20.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity to fund children either in
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
their own communities or or Statewide in
 
00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:24.200 align:start position:0%
communities where there's a lot of need
 
00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:26.079 align:start position:0%
like I know we find a lot of children in
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
Claremont but not a lot of donors in
 
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
Claremont right and so sometimes the
 
00:42:32.589 --> 00:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
donors in Claremont will come from hover
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
or New London to help those kids in
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
Claremont so I I just think it's a it's
 
00:42:40.589 --> 00:42:40.599 align:start position:0%
a great way to enable contributions to
 
00:42:42.549 --> 00:42:42.559 align:start position:0%
kids specifically for education in New
 
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I know the people
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
contributing appreciate the opportunity
 
00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:52.549 --> 00:42:52.559 align:start position:0%
that um at one point you mentioned if I
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
heard it correctly I think you said the
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
cap was around 3.1 million so the cap
 
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
total contributions that we could
 
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
receive is actually 6 million a year
 
00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:05.720 align:start position:0%
okay and the cap on the credits is 85%
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
of that so what is it 5.2 million um we
 
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
still have not reached that cap in
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
donations I we do a good job fundraising
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
we're running all over the state talking
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
to people but I mean it is only
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
fundraising in New Hampshire and so
 
00:43:22.349 --> 00:43:22.359 align:start position:0%
getting to two or three million a year
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
seems to be what we can do with our two
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
people that are doing the fundraising if
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
I had was able to hire more fundraisers
 
00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:31.480 align:start position:0%
I probably could get to that cap of 6
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
million but remember for each one of
 
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
these we're visiting with the donor
 
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
asking them to contribute to education
 
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
in their community and then they're
 
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
agreeing to so it really is a
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
fundraising job in that regard so okay
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
so the cap you were referring to was
 
00:43:48.549 --> 00:43:48.559 align:start position:0%
more a cap on just ability based on the
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
fact you don't have much so what I was
 
00:43:52.349 --> 00:43:52.359 align:start position:0%
talking about is in the law there's a
 
00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
few metrics that we have to meet which
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
is why this report is so important every
 
00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:57.790 align:start position:0%
is why this report is so important every
year

00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:00.079 align:start position:0%
one of them is that the average
 
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
scholarship which is all the
 
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
scholarships added together that we give
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
out put together and averaged has to be
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
equal to X and that number is set by the
 
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue every year based
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
on the Consumer Price Index and this
 
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
year you can see the average scholarship
 
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
this past year right on this blue sheet
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
$3,023 and then the average homeschool
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
scholarship was around $1,000 so those
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
are metrics set by the law the other
 
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
metrics are 40% of the children have to
 
00:44:33.309 --> 00:44:33.319 align:start position:0%
be in the free and reduced lunch income
 
00:44:35.549 --> 00:44:35.559 align:start position:0%
level bracket and we never struggle
 
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
meeting that metric because of course
 
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
families that are coming to us seeking
 
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
scholarship assistance need it right so
 
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
they're overwhelmingly lower income
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
families um and the other metric is the
 
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
number of children leaving public school
 
00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:50.839 align:start position:0%
going to private school and again I
 
00:44:52.589 --> 00:44:52.599 align:start position:0%
think the legislature did that to make
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
it Revenue neutral knowing that a child
 
00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
moving to a private school you using
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
this money wasn't costing their you know
 
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
town the cost to educate them or the
 
00:45:04.349 --> 00:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
state adequate education grant
 
00:45:06.109 --> 00:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
money does that help those are the
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
metrics yeah thank you yes represent
 
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
Ames um the interest in dividends tax is
 
00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:13.349 align:start position:0%
Ames um the interest in dividends tax is
going

00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:45:19.109 --> 00:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
away and um my question is uh What
 
00:45:22.109 --> 00:45:22.119 align:start position:0%
proportion of uh scholarship money has
 
00:45:22.119 --> 00:45:23.750 align:start position:0%
proportion of uh scholarship money has
come

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
come
 
00:45:26.589 --> 00:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
from against that tax yeah not very much
 
00:45:28.829 --> 00:45:28.839 align:start position:0%
un fortunately I wish it was more it was
 
00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
only about
 
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:32.200 align:start position:0%
$200,000 total so yes we'll have to
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
hustle and find new businesses that are
 
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
paying the business Enterprise or
 
00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:39.079 align:start position:0%
profits tax to donate in the place of
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
those few interest and dividends tax
 
00:45:45.549 --> 00:45:45.559 align:start position:0%
credit donors but it I it didn't do what
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
I think as much as you guys thought it
 
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
might have done again people just don't
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
know about it it's
 
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
existence so it won't have very big of
 
00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
an impact so so that it sounds like
 
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
based on the number you just said it
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
represents maybe 10% of the total the
 
00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
total last year was 3.4 million that we
 
00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
raised and it was um only about1 or
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
$200,000 of it yeah so we should be able
 
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
to make that up with hustling and and
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
finding new people that pay the other
 
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
taxes business taxes to take the make a
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
donation right sounds good s l uh no
 
00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
just about the children going back to
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
the kids um how many um how do you turn
 
00:46:29.309 --> 00:46:29.319 align:start position:0%
away applicants either due to financials
 
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
and does that look like yes we we need
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
to raise more money every year there's
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
more applications than we can meet for
 
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
example this past year um it was about
 
00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
600 children that we couldn't help
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
because we didn't raise enough money so
 
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
yes there's more demand again if I had
 
00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
another fundraiser I think it we could
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
get closer to that so I'm thinking about
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
trying to decide if I should hire
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
another person to work with us to try to
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
raise more money to help more kids
 
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
because there's always more demand than
 
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
we can meet so that there was understand
 
00:47:02.829 --> 00:47:02.839 align:start position:0%
what you just said so there was 600 kids
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
that met the low poverty level or work
 
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
but I call Working Poor level um that
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
you were unable to serve because of no
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
Financial availability cor yeah yeah we
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
run out of money every year and have to
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
that's the hardest part of the job
 
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
actually I mean you'd think fundraising
 
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
was the hardest part of the job but
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
actually getting to the end and finding
 
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
that there's people that you can't give
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
a scholarship to is the hardest part of
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
the job yeah but it just feels my fire
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
uh Senator Lang to get out there and and
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
find more people that want to
 
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
contribute to the scholarships right
 
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
welcome any other question yes so one
 
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
more thing again so but you rais it's a
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
75% right 85% 85% so we would raise you
 
00:47:52.829 --> 00:47:52.839 align:start position:0%
would get a donation that was equivalent
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
of a million dollars in education
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
dollars but the person only gets credit
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
from the state for 850,000 so we get an
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
extra 15% of available money for
 
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
Education that we would otherwise not
 
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
have that's correct yes because
 
00:48:08.349 --> 00:48:08.359 align:start position:0%
someone's giving me the whole amount and
 
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
then they're only taking a credit on p a
 
00:48:14.589 --> 00:48:14.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
it I question M related to that um
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
there's also a federal tax credit that
 
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
these businesses and individuals can
 
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
take as I understand it they talking
 
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
about that in the um Congress but it
 
00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
hasn't passed
 
00:48:34.829 --> 00:48:34.839 align:start position:0%
yet I thought I I would have thought
 
00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh an individual or a business for
 
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:43.640 align:start position:0%
that matter that makes a donation to a
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
oh you're talking about if it's a
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
charitable contribution yes they can get
 
00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
a deduction for a charitable contribu
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
top of the someone could do that
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
85% yeah most people don't do that
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
because they're not itemizing I think
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
the way the new tax law is that
 
00:48:59.950 --> 00:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
charitable contributions are not very
 
00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
beneficial right now well if they if
 
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
they are beneficial to a particular
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
individual then essentially they can get
 
00:49:10.789 --> 00:49:10.799 align:start position:0%
up pretty close to their dollar they
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
they might be able to if you're in say
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
that um a 20% tax bracket and you donate
 
00:49:21.309 --> 00:49:21.319 align:start position:0%
$10,000 your deduction so it's different
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
than a credit you know this right a
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
credit would be a minus the deduction
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
from your taxable income would be what
 
00:49:29.789 --> 00:49:29.799 align:start position:0%
$2,000 on 10 right because you're in the
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
20% bracket yeah yeah
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
yeah and there are some people to your
 
00:49:38.829 --> 00:49:38.839 align:start position:0%
question who just donate regular money
 
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
to us without a tax credit don't doubt
 
00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:46.950 align:start position:0%
to us without a tax credit don't doubt
it

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so much for having me
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for
 
00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
coming any other any other questions for
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
either Dr or scholarship
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
fund do we feel like we have enough
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
conclusions Mr chair if I may yeah my
 
00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:09.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation is to make no
 
00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation on changes to this
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
program I think it's functioning exactly
 
00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
as it's intended to we as I talked about
 
00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:19.480 align:start position:0%
the important metrics to me uh are the
 
00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
are students performing better than they
 
00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
would if they didn't have this
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
alternative and are they are they able
 
00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
to get this alternative because it's AA
 
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
able to them and the answer to both
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
those was yes they wouldn't have this if
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
we didn't have this program in place and
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have had the improvements
 
00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
if this program was it in place and so I
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
I think the credit's doing exactly what
 
00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
it's uh supposed to do I'd recommend
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
that we not change a single
 
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
thing I would agree with that anyone
 
00:50:48.789 --> 00:50:48.799 align:start position:0%
else uh representative Ames your
 
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
microphone is on so I'm assuming you
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
want to your microphone is on would you
 
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
like to say something about oh yeah well
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
if it's on maybe I should say
 
00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.109 align:start position:0%
if it's on maybe I should say
so

00:51:01.109 --> 00:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
um you know uh the reports that we've
 
00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
looked at are uh
 
00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:08.549 align:start position:0%
looked at are uh
informative

00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
informative
 
00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
um at
 
00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
a fairly high level of uh of looking at
 
00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:19.480 align:start position:0%
it all um the
 
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
U and the picture is of kids that are in
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
relatively poor families that are um
 
00:51:27.119 --> 00:51:28.190 align:start position:0%
relatively poor families that are um
getting

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
help in private schools um one part of
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
that picture is that the private schools
 
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
without having done a calculation I
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
don't know are significantly if nothing
 
00:51:46.589 --> 00:51:46.599 align:start position:0%
more um religious just by their very
 
00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
name um
 
00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:50.549 align:start position:0%
name um
and

00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:50.559 --> 00:51:53.270 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
that is an aspect aspect of this program
 
00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
that um that concerns many people the
 
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
great degree to which it is
 
00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
um providing some level of public
 
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:12.760 align:start position:0%
support uh I paused on that I'll come
 
00:52:16.589 --> 00:52:16.599 align:start position:0%
back to that uh for Religious
 
00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
Education and uh we have very little
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
information on the actual education goes
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
inside the doors so have to be cautious
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
on even describing it that way but uh
 
00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:31.559 align:start position:0%
uh there's that aspect of it and
 
00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:33.640 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:39.160 align:start position:0%
so so I don't disagree with with
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
um not putting any qualifications on our
 
00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:47.720 align:start position:0%
support other than to say that uh um to
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
report if we could get the detail the
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
proportion of kids that are in private
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
schools I'd love to include in religious
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
schools I'd love to include that
 
00:52:58.829 --> 00:52:58.839 align:start position:0%
the proportion of kids that are
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
homeschooled that's another another
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
um I guess I would leave it at that I
 
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
wish we had more information and I
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
don't I guess I'm not sure feeling
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
strongly enough about it to push for
 
00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:26.670 align:start position:0%
strongly enough about it to push for
that

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:29.069 --> 00:53:29.079 align:start position:0%
yes Senator I concur with representative
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
Ames I think you need more we need more
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
information uh when you look at the the
 
00:53:35.789 --> 00:53:35.799 align:start position:0%
numbers and you look at the number of
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
Christian related schools it gives me
 
00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:40.799 align:start position:0%
pause now I taught in a parochial school
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
I taught at Bishop Bradley high school
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
and I taught at a public school kenned
 
00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
high school up in Conway so I I I I
 
00:53:49.829 --> 00:53:49.839 align:start position:0%
think the movement here is toward a
 
00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:53.720 align:start position:0%
religiously oriented schools well those
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
schools were all
 
00:53:59.710 --> 00:53:59.720 align:start position:0%
closing remember we had numerous schools
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
with a religious affiliation in
 
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
Manchester that closed St Anthony's
 
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
closed St Mary's close St George's close
 
00:54:08.589 --> 00:54:08.599 align:start position:0%
close close close close well these are
 
00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
all now giving an opportunity to re to
 
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
revisit their their closure uh Trinity
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
just put a large addition on $2 million
 
00:54:20.109 --> 00:54:20.119 align:start position:0%
addition well look at the numbers here
 
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
Trinity is getting help through this
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
through this program not that not that
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
I'm a a post that but I I just think U
 
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
it Bears it bears looking at uh it bears
 
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
looking at I thought the comment that
 
00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
was made by the the lady I thought was
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
very appropriate but she talked about
 
00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
Bedford well bedford's a rich Community
 
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
a very rich community and and as a
 
00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
result of that you don't see a lot of
 
00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:50.200 align:start position:0%
this activity in a town like bedan
 
00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
because the public school is very
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
acceptable there spend a lot of money on
 
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
the public school and so for
 
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
I I would I would like to look
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
at the public schools where there's a
 
00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:04.750 align:start position:0%
at the public schools where there's a
significant

00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:55:07.309 --> 00:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
investment if there's any movement from
 
00:55:07.319 --> 00:55:08.950 align:start position:0%
investment if there's any movement from
that

00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
situation probably not I mean that's
 
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
just a guest but then you look at it the
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
opposite way and I think Clen wants the
 
00:55:19.109 --> 00:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
great issue and we're in court again
 
00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:21.160 align:start position:0%
right we're in court as we speak about
 
00:55:25.789 --> 00:55:25.799 align:start position:0%
it the is is it benefiting those kids I
 
00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:55:35.309 --> 00:55:35.319 align:start position:0%
obviously there are uh there there is a
 
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:37.480 align:start position:0%
desire for people to to to move into
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
this program it's I think the
 
00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
consistency is about 100 people take
 
00:55:48.069 --> 00:55:48.079 align:start position:0%
advantage of it and uh obviously at at
 
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
85% not a bad deal and not a bad deal if
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
you can also do it at the federal level
 
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's very helpful
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
so I've
 
00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:01.720 align:start position:0%
seen the Advent of of uh movement in
 
00:56:04.589 --> 00:56:04.599 align:start position:0%
education over the years will continue
 
00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
to see that I think we'll continue to
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
see that as we as we kind of move move
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
along just my my comments I think it's
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
it's interesting to look at the to look
 
00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
at the data we'll get a little deeper
 
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
into the data but what we have
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
presented to ourselves it it just seems
 
00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:27.640 align:start position:0%
to be if you use this method sure it's
 
00:56:30.029 --> 00:56:30.039 align:start position:0%
going to be favorable to you would you
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
say it was
 
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
negative well there are no people did
 
00:56:36.829 --> 00:56:36.839 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah there some yeah a thousand
 
00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
said yes and and five said no there's
 
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:41.960 align:start position:0%
always one in the crow come on you when
 
00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
you get 99% that say yes I'd say it's uh
 
00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:49.480 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it is it is it is what it is
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
and it is what it is but thank you I
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
mean when she one minute when she said
 
00:56:57.309 --> 00:56:57.319 align:start position:0%
uh when she brought Bedford into the
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
conversation it was my understanding
 
00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
that you know in General Bedford
 
00:57:03.390 --> 00:57:03.400 align:start position:0%
students are high performing and this
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
this group was performing at that level
 
00:57:08.109 --> 00:57:08.119 align:start position:0%
I don't think she was talking about
 
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
anything other than performance
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
level that may be so but B spends the
 
00:57:13.839 --> 00:57:15.630 align:start position:0%
level that may be so but B spends the
most

00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:15.640 align:start position:0%
most
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
money yeah the point well the point is
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
but the point the point of the matter is
 
00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
I think they got a beautiful school they
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
have a beautiful athletic programs they
 
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
spent a ton of money a ton of money and
 
00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:30.280 align:start position:0%
the and and the mediate family income in
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
benefit is almost $200,000 a year you
 
00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:35.960 align:start position:0%
think they're going to have good schools
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
no but I'm not arguing that point I'm
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
just saying what she's saying is the
 
00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
level of um academic achievement they're
 
00:57:44.829 --> 00:57:44.839 align:start position:0%
saying is
 
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
high representative do said Yeah just
 
00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
something I noted was there seems to be
 
00:57:53.069 --> 00:57:53.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of talk about uh homeschooling but
 
00:57:55.029 --> 00:57:55.039 align:start position:0%
the numbers for the homeschooled kids
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
here are 100 at 110 I thought I saw in
 
00:58:00.789 --> 00:58:00.799 align:start position:0%
comparison so we can take AP our
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
components what what what uh we're
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
seeing is there's a positive effect for
 
00:58:08.589 --> 00:58:08.599 align:start position:0%
the kids at the end of the day there's a
 
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
positive effect for the kids it's done
 
00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
in a cost effective way
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
and the job at hand is getting the kids
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
the best education and it's happening
 
00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:20.559 align:start position:0%
under the program so it's working well I
 
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change right a
 
00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
thing and go ahead so again I I I don't
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
want to get into the policy discussion
 
00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
of whether we should exclude religious
 
00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
schools or not I don't know that that's
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
the function of this committee the
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
function of the committee is we have a
 
00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:36.079 align:start position:0%
tax expenditure program and is the
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
program's goal is to support
 
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
underprivileged children who give them
 
00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:43.160 align:start position:0%
additional educational Choice um and and
 
00:58:45.069 --> 00:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
and have a metric for whether or not
 
00:58:47.829 --> 00:58:47.839 align:start position:0%
performance is is improved I think we
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
heard from Kate that the the uh from uh
 
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
Dr Baker that they use a metric from
 
00:58:56.789 --> 00:58:56.799 align:start position:0%
doed to approve organizations that have
 
00:58:58.349 --> 00:58:58.359 align:start position:0%
a certain performance level kidss are
 
00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
meeting at 85% or above on performance
 
00:59:03.549 --> 00:59:03.559 align:start position:0%
level for an ed for those that that
 
00:59:06.549 --> 00:59:06.559 align:start position:0%
school to be eligible for uh those this
 
00:59:08.029 --> 00:59:08.039 align:start position:0%
program and so again I think
 
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
continuously the question is are we
 
00:59:11.029 --> 00:59:11.039 align:start position:0%
providing for the citizens of New
 
00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:13.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire value for their dollars as it
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
relates to education and everything I've
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
heard says yes um that if we want to
 
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
have the policy argu whether you want to
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
exclude religious schools that's for the
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
legislature to take up in a different
 
00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
time but for the purpose of this expend
 
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
as it's reported and as it's currently
 
00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:31.240 align:start position:0%
constituted it is performing well for
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
our citizens um it's performing well um
 
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
we get we get an increased 15% value in
 
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
education just by the tax credit by only
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
being 85% we get a million dollars in
 
00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:43.880 align:start position:0%
for education and we only have to give a
 
00:59:46.589 --> 00:59:46.599 align:start position:0%
credit for 850,000 we get a bonus on top
 
00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
of that from the state for our children
 
00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
um you know the mere fact that she has
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
600 kids she has to turn away really
 
00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:54.839 align:start position:0%
breaks my heart that there's kids still
 
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
out there looking for need and looking
 
00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
for work that we don't have availability
 
01:00:00.589 --> 01:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
for but that's not what we're here to
 
01:00:03.029 --> 01:00:03.039 align:start position:0%
solve either right I think this program
 
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
is doing what it's meant to do um its
 
01:00:08.029 --> 01:00:08.039 align:start position:0%
metrics seem to be hitting exactly what
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
we wanted to do and again I have no
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:25.240 align:start position:0%
comment I guess I guess um I I want to
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
see whether this point we want to uh
 
01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:31.839 align:start position:0%
make a motion on that and and and then
 
01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll be done we'll write a report
 
01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:36.280 align:start position:0%
on this um I feel like that's where
 
01:00:40.029 --> 01:00:40.039 align:start position:0%
we're at but I just want to see where
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
um if if the members agree on
 
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
that I'll make a motion that we that we
 
01:00:50.589 --> 01:00:50.599 align:start position:0%
make no recommended changes to this
 
01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
program second second by
 
01:00:58.829 --> 01:00:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
discussion I I kind I agree with the
 
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation I think the program is
 
01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
what the program is but let's look at
 
01:01:08.029 --> 01:01:08.039 align:start position:0%
somebody should be looking at the
 
01:01:09.789 --> 01:01:09.799 align:start position:0%
program a little more seriously look at
 
01:01:12.029 --> 01:01:12.039 align:start position:0%
the data and and look at the
 
01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:14.559 align:start position:0%
preponderance of religious
 
01:01:17.309 --> 01:01:17.319 align:start position:0%
schools and I I think that's that's
 
01:01:20.829 --> 01:01:20.839 align:start position:0%
important that that's important uh
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
and somehow some way
 
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
U look at that
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
as how it fits into into the mix uh
 
01:01:32.549 --> 01:01:32.559 align:start position:0%
we're we're as as we speak we're
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
currently involved in a very
 
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
serious legal challenge to public
 
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
education and how public education is
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
funded that challenge has been accepted
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
by the Supreme Court we uh the state has
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
to defend its position a superior court
 
01:01:51.069 --> 01:01:51.079 align:start position:0%
judge has said that we
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
underfund public education by about
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
50% he says we need another 500 billion
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh for public schools if you read the
 
01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:01.400 align:start position:0%
decision I'm not sure you've all read
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
the decision well that's a that's a lot
 
01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:07.720 align:start position:0%
of money compared to to what we're
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
expending here you know that's that's
 
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
that's a significant jump and and we'll
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
have to see how that uh how how that
 
01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
work works out but I think it's it's
 
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
clear or it's clear to me we have
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
problems with the way we deal with
 
01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:24.829 align:start position:0%
problems with the way we deal with
public

01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
education and the way we Finance public
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
education I've been around here for a
 
01:02:31.269 --> 01:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
long time I was on the committee of
 
01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
conference in 1999 when we settled the
 
01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
Claremont decision you when we came up
 
01:02:40.589 --> 01:02:40.599 align:start position:0%
with the possible solution uh so that's
 
01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
been around the long long long time uh
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
and U we we we we're going to have to
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
revisit a lot of things in the next
 
01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:50.870 align:start position:0%
revisit a lot of things in the next
legislative

01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:53.720 align:start position:0%
session thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
um I think the other piece of d dat that
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at as well is that the cap
 
01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
is 5.1 5.2 million we're only at 2.2 and
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
when you look at the last few years it
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
bounced I mean it was 1.9 million two
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
years ago then it was 1 point I don't
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
have it right in front of me now 1.4 1.5
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
then 2.2 we're not talking about huge
 
01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:19.240 align:start position:0%
numbers here I think at this point um to
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and and say that you know
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
this program is working um you're not
 
01:03:25.589 --> 01:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
looking at huge numbers right now and it
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:15.090 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:23.549 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:04:23.549 --> 01:04:23.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
think okay I'll say again when I write
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
up the notes I'll make sure this all the
 
01:04:30.430 --> 01:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
committee reports like you can go back I
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
got the ones from the previous years
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
right so the minutes are all included
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to review and see what
 
01:04:38.029 --> 01:04:38.039 align:start position:0%
discussions were the recommendations end
 
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
up just being a summary of here's what
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
we end up coming to a con conclusion not
 
01:04:42.599 --> 01:04:44.549 align:start position:0%
we end up coming to a con conclusion not
the

01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:26.109 --> 01:05:26.119 align:start position:0%
right I mean yeah definitely no need to
 
01:05:27.549 --> 01:05:27.559 align:start position:0%
increase and we're not even halfway
 
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
there so dick I don't know if you
 
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
remember when I was in the onways me I
 
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
was the one that actually put a cap on
 
01:05:34.109 --> 01:05:34.119 align:start position:0%
this was an unlimited tax credit
 
01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
originally um we put the $5 million
 
01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
credit on by my by my Amendment um I
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
don't remember his last ter with
 
01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
before no no it was it had and that's
 
01:05:50.349 --> 01:05:50.359 align:start position:0%
what I was afraid of um so I was nervous
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
with a no UNCA tax cred um and so we
 
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
talked we talked with uh with da we
 
01:05:58.589 --> 01:05:58.599 align:start position:0%
talked with with Kate and we came up
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
with the $5 million number that was
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable and because we knew it was
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
only about $1 million about one point
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
1.8 I think it was somewhere around
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
there so we paid a a $5 million cap deal
 
01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
with the future we don't have to worry
 
01:06:19.069 --> 01:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
shape it's a half on the total number of
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
credits that can issue for any for
 
01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:26.200 align:start position:0%
totally regardless of where it falls
 
01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
they can
 
01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:29.069 align:start position:0%
they can
issue

01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:29.079 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
yeah but that's a total number across
 
01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
the state total number across the entire
 
01:06:35.589 --> 01:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
State it's it's a so the maximum we will
 
01:06:38.349 --> 01:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
ever have a reduction in revenue is $5.1
 
01:06:40.269 --> 01:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
million right that's the maximum
 
01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
reduction we can
 
01:06:44.589 --> 01:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
get is it directly against the tax or is
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
it a so they get so so correct me if I'm
 
01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
wrong but I think I'm right on this they
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
basically get get a the the donor gets a
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
a check not a virtual check saying hey
 
01:06:57.029 --> 01:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
you get you know you you donated uh
 
01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
$10,000 to this uh program you get an
 
01:07:02.589 --> 01:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
$88,500 tax credit when you submit your
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
tax bill you know you can apply this
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
credit to taxes owned and then if they
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
owe $10,000 in credit they only write
 
01:07:11.309 --> 01:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
$1,500 check and their taxes are covered
 
01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
well yeah there there's nothing wrong
 
01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
with that but it'll be a small very
 
01:07:53.839 --> 01:07:59.910 align:start position:0%
with that but it'll be a small very
small

01:07:59.910 --> 01:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:01.950 --> 01:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
it ended up being a very small it was up
 
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
to a couple
 
01:08:06.029 --> 01:08:06.039 align:start position:0%
hundred, on
 
01:08:11.549 --> 01:08:11.559 align:start position:0%
a yeah it was probably roughly 5% of the
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
total and
 
01:08:16.669 --> 01:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
she and she felt very confident that she
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
could um raise enough money from the
 
01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
business profit from the business
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
profits and business Enterprise tax
 
01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
okay um if there's no other discussion
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
we'll uh call for a vote
 
01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
