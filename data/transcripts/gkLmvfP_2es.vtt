Tim Lang I represent District Two
 
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
um before you is the simple commission
 
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
bill this bill was brought at the
 
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
request of former representative Pat
 
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
abrami who is the vice chair of ways of
 
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
means last year and served on this
 
00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
committee as the chairman for for this
 
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
commission apparently the commission
 
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
didn't quite get their work done to be
 
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
polite and they asked for the commission
 
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
to be renewed so they can finish up they
 
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
have a couple minor issues apparently
 
00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
they they feel they need to address and
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
finish up the commission report and so
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
before you as a bill bringing that
 
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
forward so he can continue his work as
 
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
as we voted on this before last term
 
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
obviously when the commission was formed
 
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
they just ran out of time by the
 
00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 align:start position:0%
November 1st deadline for the report
 
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
just asking for it to be renewed so they
 
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
can finish their work
 
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
any questions for Senator Lang
 
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has one so
 
00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
just so we're clear on this this is
 
00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
basically just a continuation of a
 
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
commission to try to solve the problem
 
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's been going on for years and years
 
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
and years on how to assess utility
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%

while we are neutral on the bill that is
 
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:58.620 align:start position:0%
correct these the bill and the study
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
that it is requesting has complicated
 
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
legal issues and Tax and Revenue related
 
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
issues and we would urge the committee
 
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
to support the continuation of this
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
study because we feel it's a critical
 
00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:12.539 align:start position:0%
importance to comprehend and understand
 
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
any change to methodology assessing or
 
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:17.220 align:start position:0%
how this policy could affect
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
municipality school districts and
 
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.170 align:start position:0%
municipality school districts and
taxpayers

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
any potential change if not studied
 
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
completely and we as we heard we don't
 
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
have the data needed could trigger some
 
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence as we kind of
 
00:08:32.089 --> 00:08:32.099 align:start position:0%
look at it at the surface so we would
 
00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:33.899 align:start position:0%
hope that the the committee would
 
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
support the re-establishment of this
 
00:08:38.209 --> 00:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
commission so I'm certainly happy to
 
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:49.740 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee for Ms
 
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.930 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee for Ms
heck

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:53.940 align:start position:0%

I'm looking at a pink card here that I
 
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
think could be an error
 
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
Dan Dolan from the New England power
 
00:09:13.009 --> 00:09:13.019 align:start position:0%
generous generators Association did you
 
00:09:16.009 --> 00:09:16.019 align:start position:0%
mean to testify on this bill you did
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
wow I'm surprised but I'm happy so I'll
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and and good
 
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
morning to the rest of the Committees
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
good to see you uh the the reason that I
 
00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to to testify on on this bill is
 
00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:35.339 align:start position:0%
uh last year we were one of the entities
 
00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519 align:start position:0%
that requested the original formation of
 
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:40.740 align:start position:0%
this commission served on the commission
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
with representative merner and several
 
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
other uh members and we strongly support
 
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
the continuation of the commission we do
 
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:50.820 align:start position:0%
think progress has been made more time
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunately was necessary and so
 
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll we'll be able to do that
 
00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
the the fundamental issue as we see it
 
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
that that drove the formation of this
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
commission was a unique nature of how
 
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire assesses and values power
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
plans for the purposes of property taxes
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
where uh New Hampshire is unique uh
 
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
nationally in creating a two-step
 
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
assessment process one at the municipal
 
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
level one done uh by the Department of
 
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
Revenue administration at the Statewide
 
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
level within two separate assessments of
 
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
of property taxes coming out of that
 
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
what we are looking for as asset owners
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
of those facilities is more consistency
 
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
and hopefully a little bit of
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
streamlining through the process part of
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
this also appears to have been a Vestige
 
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
of the change in the industry where
 
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
previously these power plants were owned
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
by utilities with full rate recovery at
 
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
the puc that is no longer the case and
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
yet we seem to be caught in between to a
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
certain degree here and again I think
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
given the complexity of these issues as
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
Ms heck pointed out as well as some of
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
the progress that was made in a
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
constructive dialogue last year we're
 
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
hopeful to be able to get back to work
 
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
and make another recommendation to the
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
the legislature I have copies of the
 
00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:12.370 align:start position:0%
the legislature I have copies of the
original

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:12.380 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
report from the commission done at the
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
end of last year led by at the time
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative abrami happy to
 
00:11:20.569 --> 00:11:20.579 align:start position:0%
distribute those and certainly take any
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
questions that that may be helpful here
 
00:11:26.449 --> 00:11:26.459 align:start position:0%
well thank you I just forwarded to
 
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
members of the committee the email
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
containing the report but you are most
 
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:34.740 align:start position:0%
welcome to distribute your copies I've
 
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
got them here so I might as well you
 
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
might as well uh representative McGee
 
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chairman
 
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Dolan for taking my
 
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
question my question is around your um
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
statement that you're looking at
 
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
streamlining that there's basically two
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
different assessing processes that are
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
going on between dra and I guess
 
00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
municipalities so uh since you've been
 
00:11:58.610 --> 00:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
involved the whole time can you just
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
explain for us how that would be
 
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
streamlined who would take the lead that
 
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
sort of thing is that where you're
 
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
trying to go with it is to figure that
 
00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:08.339 align:start position:0%
out or yeah so that is one of the core
 
00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:10.019 align:start position:0%
questions in in front of the commission
 
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
and there's a few different ways to to
 
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
approach it uh you could have the state
 
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
create a single valuation that then
 
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
would be applied at the municipal and
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
the state level for taxes you could flip
 
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
that around you could have the
 
00:12:23.329 --> 00:12:23.339 align:start position:0%
municipality uh conduct the single
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
assessment that that would would then be
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
applied at both levels you could create
 
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
a formula uh that would then be equally
 
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh administered for for municipal or
 
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
state or you could change some of the
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
overall structure of those taxes given
 
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:41.720 align:start position:0%
the fact that for example uh these are
 
00:12:44.449 --> 00:12:44.459 align:start position:0%
non-utility facilities and yet are
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
covered under the utility property tax
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
at the Statewide level so there are
 
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
there's a whole menu of different
 
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
options which is one of the reasons that
 
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
I I think it it um is worth further
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
deliberation for the are consideration
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
that sounds like it Mr chairman
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up yeah and that the
 
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
follow-on thought is
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that we're unique
 
00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
in the United States so do we have
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
examples that are being considered by
 
00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:12.839 align:start position:0%
the committee in terms of what we you
 
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
know might be doing to make it more
 
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
uniform uh so one of the uh the first uh
 
00:13:22.129 --> 00:13:22.139 align:start position:0%
tasks that we did do is look uh at how
 
00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
other states do it how both other states
 
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
in New England as well as across the
 
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:26.810 align:start position:0%
in New England as well as across the
country

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
um uh suffice to say there is not a
 
00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
standard best practice in how this is
 
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.810 align:start position:0%
standard best practice in how this is
done

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:34.820 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
there are just about every different
 
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
flavor out there with than pros and cons
 
00:13:42.889 --> 00:13:42.899 align:start position:0%
through it but yes one of the elements
 
00:13:45.769 --> 00:13:45.779 align:start position:0%
uh that we are trying to to look at is
 
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
what are some of the best practices
 
00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:50.339 align:start position:0%
Lessons Learned we can get um from from
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
other places and and one of the reasons
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
in particular that this we in particular
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
have concerns and I I don't want to
 
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:00.180 align:start position:0%
speak for others but I believe there was
 
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:02.220 align:start position:0%
recognition across the commission is
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
that with these two separate evaluations
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
it creates more litigation risk both for
 
00:14:10.009 --> 00:14:10.019 align:start position:0%
the the municipality as well as for for
 
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
the asset owner and again it to the
 
00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
degree there's a way to centralize that
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
streamline that
 
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
um that I think would be beneficial to
 
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.870 align:start position:0%
um that I think would be beneficial to
all

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
okay representative munz has a question
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
coming in today
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
um as a member of the commission and are
 
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
are you is the commission looking at
 
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
some of the uh property tax exemptions
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
that have been given to
 
00:14:39.839 --> 00:14:40.610 align:start position:0%
that have been given to
um

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:40.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:43.820 align:start position:0%
power producers in the state
 
00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:46.279 align:start position:0%
including Seabrook
 
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:50.540 align:start position:0%
that were put in place to encourage
 
00:14:52.689 --> 00:14:52.699 align:start position:0%
pollution control
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
that predate the federal requirement
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
that all facilities must have uh
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
Pollution Control
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
so certainly there's there's a number of
 
00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:03.899 align:start position:0%
those types of elements that affect any
 
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
uh generation Source the Mandate of this
 
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
this commission was narrow to just uh uh
 
00:15:14.569 --> 00:15:14.579 align:start position:0%
the the property tax value and so uh in
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
while there was a recognition that there
 
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
are some of those different elements
 
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
Pollution Control being a key one but
 
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
this short answer is no we were not
 
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
looking collectively at at the overall
 
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
tax liability of a facility and and
 
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
trying to to come up with some other
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
formula it was specific to just this
 
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
follow up so if I understood correctly
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
what you're doing is saying coming up
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
with a methodology on how the property
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
that should be included as a as uh
 
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
should be included to pay property tax
 
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
should be assessed
 
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:56.220 align:start position:0%
and how the values are the value yes
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
representative merner has a question or
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
a comment
 
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
more of a comment back uh a few terms
 
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
ago with the representative abrami we
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
had a house bill 700 which uh chip and
 
00:16:15.769 --> 00:16:15.779 align:start position:0%
votes at the time had worked on pretty
 
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
hard too when we had put many many a
 
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
year worth of work in that on a study
 
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
to do this original in that bill was to
 
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
attack this problem but it took so long
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
just to work through all the other stuff
 
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
we left this to the side so this is just
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
a continuation of what we're trying to
 
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:35.220 align:start position:0%
do to get a fair assessment which I
 
00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:37.139 align:start position:0%
think the com that commission back then
 
00:16:38.689 --> 00:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
did a really good job putting this
 
00:16:41.449 --> 00:16:41.459 align:start position:0%
together for 700 so this was what we're
 
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:42.839 align:start position:0%
trying to do now but this is a lot more
 
00:16:44.689 --> 00:16:44.699 align:start position:0%
complex than
 
00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:46.139 align:start position:0%
as you can see because I can tell you
 
00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
right now I've got probably at least 600
 
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
Pages worth of stuff over the last
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
summer we met quite frequently to try to
 
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
but we they've made a tremendous amount
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
of progress in a lot with your help and
 
00:16:57.769 --> 00:16:57.779 align:start position:0%
you know we've had a lot of good players
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
there at the table so uh just to bring
 
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
people here up to speed because I was
 
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
the one here from the committee that was
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
on there that's all thank you
 
00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:08.819 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:17:12.409 --> 00:17:12.419 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has one
 
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh so I see the uh
 
00:17:20.449 --> 00:17:20.459 align:start position:0%
report deadline is one November of this
 
00:17:20.459 --> 00:17:21.770 align:start position:0%
report deadline is one November of this
year

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
given the complexity that's been
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
discussed Now by all three of you folks
 
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
is that date reasonable or should it be
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
later I think it is reasonable I think
 
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:35.220 align:start position:0%
we all work better on on deadlines
 
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
particularly uh near term ones and I
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
will say
 
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
um as representative murder noted we did
 
00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
meet quite frequently last year and I do
 
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
think we were able to make a lot of
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
progress particularly around the scope
 
00:17:51.409 --> 00:17:51.419 align:start position:0%
of of what's the the problems statement
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
so to speak and so I am hopeful that
 
00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to to get this done and
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
having a deadline at the end of this
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
year will drive a certain amount of
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
urgency hopefully among the commission
 
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
members too
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:07.740 align:start position:0%
I have a question for you the original
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
charge of the commission was to
 
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
determine the best way to assess power
 
00:18:15.529 --> 00:18:15.539 align:start position:0%
generation and transmission and I
 
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
noticed that one of the findings of the
 
00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
commission's report was to kind of
 
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.230 align:start position:0%
commission's report was to kind of
bifurcate

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
bifurcate
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
for Kate uh transmission and generation
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
can you tell us a little bit about why
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
that finding was made and whether
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
that bifurcation is one of the reasons
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
why you need to continue the work of the
 
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
commission yes so I think there are
 
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
there's there's two reasons for for that
 
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
the the first was
 
00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
um uh for as often and hard as as the
 
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
committee uh did work and meet uh not
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
once did we uh in any meaningful way get
 
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
into transmission we uh Focus only on
 
00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
generation and even that was more than
 
00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
enough uh on our plate at that time so
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
one was
 
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
um trying to be realistic on on the
 
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
scope and and the capabilities that that
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
we had to address an issue the second is
 
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.610 align:start position:0%
we had to address an issue the second is
that

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
um for the same reason the generation
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
was split off when this was originally
 
00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
done on uh the distribution assets for
 
00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:20.039 align:start position:0%
utilities largely because from a
 
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
regulatory and an ownership standpoint
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
those are are very differently situated
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh distribution like transmission
 
00:19:30.529 --> 00:19:30.539 align:start position:0%
um is almost entirely owned by utilities
 
00:19:33.049 --> 00:19:33.059 align:start position:0%
with rate recovery generation is not
 
00:19:36.409 --> 00:19:36.419 align:start position:0%
and so um from that end generation and
 
00:19:36.419 --> 00:19:38.110 align:start position:0%
and so um from that end generation and
transmission

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
don't fit neatly into a single bucket
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
they really do feel like separate issues
 
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
and one of the the items that that we
 
00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:48.059 align:start position:0%
noted is to the degree that transmission
 
00:19:51.529 --> 00:19:51.539 align:start position:0%
owners and uh the municipalities that um
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
that house them which is just about
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
everybody uh feel that there is an issue
 
00:19:59.570 --> 00:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh similar to generation with how the
 
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
the assets are being valued that would
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
probably be worth a separate commission
 
00:20:06.409 --> 00:20:06.419 align:start position:0%
to to look at at this point I am not
 
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
aware of anybody pushing for that um but
 
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
we're trying to to narrow our scope to
 
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
just the power plants
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
so as a follow-up would you expect that
 
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
if this commission was to move forward
 
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
again that it would try to tackle
 
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
transmission no and in fact one of the
 
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
the the changes we recommended in in the
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
report and is uh in this bill is to
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
narrow it actually to only generation
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
that that is uh one of the only
 
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
substantive changes in this bill versus
 
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
uh the the original Bill last year
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
thanks for that clarification
 
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has one thank
 
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:47.940 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
question so again from what you're
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
saying if we would have changed the bill
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
to bring transmission back in
 
00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
two years from now we'd be sitting here
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
again asking for an extension on the
 
00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.169 align:start position:0%
again asking for an extension on the
commission

00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
I I think that is a realistic assumption
 
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
I would also note that one other um key
 
00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
component of that is the makeup of the
 
00:21:09.049 --> 00:21:09.059 align:start position:0%
commission last year and what is being
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
proposed as the overall makeup of the
 
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
commission for this uh iteration does
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
not have expertise on transmission I I
 
00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
put myself squarely in that camp of I am
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
not the transmission guy I'm the power
 
00:21:24.169 --> 00:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
plant guy uh and so to the degree there
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
is that interest I I think we would both
 
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
need to have a longer period of time and
 
00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
um a more robust makeup on that side of
 
00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:36.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:39.169 --> 00:21:39.179 align:start position:0%
representative munz has another question
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair this may be a
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
relatively minor point but the bill is
 
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
very specific in saying that the charge
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
of the commission is to come up with an
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
approach to assess the assets of 59
 
00:21:54.649 --> 00:21:54.659 align:start position:0%
power generation facilities I'm assuming
 
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
that what this is really trying to do is
 
00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
come up with a methodology that will
 
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
apply not only to those that exist today
 
00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:02.820 align:start position:0%
but in the future
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
that is correct so follow-up follow-up
 
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
so would it make sense
 
00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
um to just change the wording so that
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
it's a that it's broader if there's any
 
00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
confusion on on that matter it the the
 
00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
expectation is it is both for existing
 
00:22:24.049 --> 00:22:24.059 align:start position:0%
and any new that that may fall under
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
that category yes thank you
 
00:22:33.409 --> 00:22:33.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll thank you Mr Dolan for
 
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:38.460 align:start position:0%
your testimony on this bill and with no
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
further pink cards
 
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
I'll ask if there's anyone else out
 
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
there who would like to say something
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
about this bill before we conclude this
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
question thank you um and I I should
 
00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:55.460 align:start position:0%
have asked this of the original
 
00:23:00.169 --> 00:23:00.179 align:start position:0%
presenter Senator Lang on page two line
 
00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:02.220 align:start position:0%
nine it says section two of this act
 
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
shall take effect November 1st 2023 but
 
00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
that's the completion date
 
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's the way OLS typically
 
00:23:18.529 --> 00:23:18.539 align:start position:0%
writes these uh repeal sections
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
they figure that if the report is due on
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
the first it'll be done before the first
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
because it's due on the first therefore
 
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
you can dissolve the commission on the
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
first on the date of the report that's
 
00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:31.740 align:start position:0%
the way OLS typically does these things
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
okay since no one else wants to talk
 
00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
about this bill at this point in time I
 
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
will close this public hearing and we
 
00:23:45.169 --> 00:23:45.179 align:start position:0%
will open a new public Hearing in a few
 
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
minutes but before we get to that
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has something
 
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
to discuss with the committee thank you
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I think we have extra time here
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh we are nearing the end of our public
 
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
hearing and exec sessions this month and
 
00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:03.740 align:start position:0%
so my plan is starting in May
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
we want to look at the Tuesdays in May
 
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
for having some committee trips
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
and so I will start organizing and
 
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
reaching out to the various
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
organizations for some potential trips I
 
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
think one thing we have in the hopper uh
 
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:22.740 align:start position:0%
at some date is perhaps a trip to the
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
Natural Gas facility in Londonderry
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps about the Belvedere distribution
 
00:24:30.049 --> 00:24:30.059 align:start position:0%
plant with the solar array on this on
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
the ceiling on the rooftops in uh there
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
and also we can look at other trips
 
00:24:39.649 --> 00:24:39.659 align:start position:0%
regarding uh perhaps the more Dam in in
 
00:24:42.649 --> 00:24:42.659 align:start position:0%
the Littleton Burgess power plant other
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
ideas or suggestions that might come up
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
but uh the only way that we can have
 
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
these trips I think is if we need at
 
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
least at least half of the committee
 
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
that would be going on these trips
 
00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's kind of fruitless for
 
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
having long trips with only uh four or
 
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
five people I think and I think one that
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
we postponed and we would be looking at
 
00:25:08.169 --> 00:25:08.179 align:start position:0%
is a trip to the eversource control
 
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
plant in Manchester picture as well so
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
keep those Tuesdays in mind in May and I
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
will put out words as soon as we figure
 
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
out which dates which trips that we can
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
do if you have any questions just
 
00:25:27.409 --> 00:25:27.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
any comments from the committee with
 
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:32.700 align:start position:0%
regard to this proposal
 
00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
representative muns
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
would there also be an opportunity to
 
00:25:39.529 --> 00:25:39.539 align:start position:0%
bring some people in to maybe have some
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
to to kind of get some education on some
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
topics that may be of interest to
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
I'm you know the one that I'm
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
particularly interested in is artificial
 
00:25:51.529 --> 00:25:51.539 align:start position:0%
intelligence from my point of view the
 
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
answer is yes but representative Thomas
 
00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
is in charge of that so I'll let him
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
address that
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
um certainly we can do that uh if we do
 
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
that I would say that maybe we can use
 
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
one of our Mondays to uh to have someone
 
00:26:06.169 --> 00:26:06.179 align:start position:0%
commit that because we do have this we
 
00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
have this room reserved on Mondays and
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays so if we want to take a trip on
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
a Tuesday and have a presentator
 
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
presentation here on on a Monday we can
 
00:26:18.529 --> 00:26:18.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
foreign thank you so we have about six
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
minutes so we're going to take a six
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
minute break and then we will con resume
 
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
committee activity with Senate bill 52.
 
00:26:33.649 --> 00:26:33.659 align:start position:0%
we'll be back here promptly at 9 30.
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:47.520 --> 00:34:14.869 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:17.329 --> 00:34:17.339 align:start position:0%
okay everybody it's 9 30 and I would
 
00:34:19.369 --> 00:34:19.379 align:start position:0%
like to open a public hearing on Senate
 
00:34:21.169 --> 00:34:21.179 align:start position:0%
bill 52.
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
and Senate Bill 52 in case you were not
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
aware is relative to the regulation and
 
00:34:29.089 --> 00:34:29.099 align:start position:0%
operation of electric vehicle charging
 
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
stations and we have Senator Tim Lang
 
00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:35.220 align:start position:0%
who is the Bill's Prime sponsor here to
 
00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill so Senator de lang
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
the floor is yours thank you Mr chairman
 
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee again
 
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
I'm Senator Tim Lang from District 2.
 
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
that runs from the east side of 93
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
starting at exit 20 and going all the
 
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
way up to exit 29. that's the New Jersey
 
00:34:51.169 --> 00:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
and me talking right now
 
00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
um so what you have before you is a bill
 
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
relative to electric vehicle charging
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
stations and so I I'm going to kind of
 
00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
well I'll talk about the bill I just
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
want to explain why this bill was put in
 
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
um so this bill is about electro
 
00:35:08.089 --> 00:35:08.099 align:start position:0%
electric electric charging stations here
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and what we're doing to
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
promote them or have them happen and the
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
reason why I remember not a member of
 
00:35:15.069 --> 00:35:15.079 align:start position:0%
the Science and Tech committee or the
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
Senate science or Tech committee put
 
00:35:20.329 --> 00:35:20.339 align:start position:0%
this in is because I was concerned about
 
00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's actions as it relates to
 
00:35:22.859 --> 00:35:23.930 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's actions as it relates to
tourism

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:23.940 align:start position:0%
tourism
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
I'm the chairman of the Senate Ways and
 
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
Means Committee so I look at my uh
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
revenues when it comes to rooms and
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
meals tax on a regular basis and I look
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
at what's going on in our communities
 
00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
around us and as I had discussion about
 
00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:38.099 align:start position:0%
this with various members we were
 
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
discussing the fact that
 
00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
um Massachusetts is seeing a significant
 
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
increase in electronic in EVS being
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
registered in 2020 they only had two
 
00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
percent in 2022 they already have seven
 
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
percent where that's going to go in the
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
future when you consider the fact that
 
00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:55.740 align:start position:0%
over 40 percent of the airbnbs booked in
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is booked by people from
 
00:35:57.359 --> 00:35:59.089 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is booked by people from
Massachusetts

00:35:59.089 --> 00:35:59.099 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
um so I was concerned about the fact
 
00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:04.140 align:start position:0%
that absent a good charging
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure we may potentially start
 
00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
seeing problems with our tourism given a
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
person from Massachusetts who might want
 
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:11.700 align:start position:0%
to take a drive up and go skiing at say
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
Loon Mountain but with the absence of
 
00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
any charging station you can't get back
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
home so he decides to go over Sugarloaf
 
00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
or go over to may go over to Vermont
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
instead I wanted to at least start the
 
00:36:21.359 --> 00:36:22.790 align:start position:0%
instead I wanted to at least start the
conversation

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:36:25.849 --> 00:36:25.859 align:start position:0%
about what charging stations uh being
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
available mean for the State of New
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and especially as it relates
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
to things like tourism and and the
 
00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:33.980 align:start position:0%
impact it could possibly have
 
00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
the Senate Transportation committee
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
amended this bill which was completely
 
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
okay with me and they created the study
 
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
Commission because we do want to
 
00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
evaluate and study uh what's going on
 
00:36:46.609 --> 00:36:46.619 align:start position:0%
and what the impact of the State of New
 
00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this bill was an attempt at um
 
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
you know there's that that saying when's
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
the best time to plant a tree and the
 
00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
answer was 10 years ago right the next
 
00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
best time is to do it right now
 
00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:00.060 align:start position:0%
right and so my goal was this is we
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
didn't plant a tree 10 years ago but we
 
00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
can look at this right now and make sure
 
00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
that we have the infrastructure in place
 
00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
to help
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
um I I the other thing that was
 
00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:10.980 align:start position:0%
important to me in this conversation was
 
00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
the fact that the Make Ready work that
 
00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
needs to get done again the work that
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
happens between the pole and the meter
 
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
um that is borne by the utilities
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
in this instance should not be pushed
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
down to the rate payers and that was one
 
00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why I wanted to have this
 
00:37:28.609 --> 00:37:28.619 align:start position:0%
conversation that if the state takes
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
action and we think that it's important
 
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
that we start enabling and creating this
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that it doesn't raise our
 
00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
rates it's not pushed to the utilities
 
00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
and utilities are forced to do work
 
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:41.940 align:start position:0%
which would then go to every single rate
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
payer so the idea behind this was start
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
a conversation about where revenue
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
streams may come from whether it's the
 
00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
federal infrastructure bill that we
 
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
assign money to to do this or otherwise
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
and that's the reason for the study
 
00:37:56.329 --> 00:37:56.339 align:start position:0%
committee so I'll take questions but
 
00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
there are a lot smarter people behind me
 
00:37:59.450 --> 00:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
that can probably answer any technical
 
00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:00.839 align:start position:0%
questions you have a lot better than I
 
00:38:00.839 --> 00:38:02.270 align:start position:0%
questions you have a lot better than I
can

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Lang so representative
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
Corman has a question for you
 
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you senator
 
00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
I'm also wondering about uh people who
 
00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:14.940 align:start position:0%
have EVS who live in New Hampshire but
 
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
don't have access to home charging they
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
live in an apartment or just you know
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
they they won't be able to charge at
 
00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
home is this bill intended to help those
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents so again the the
 
00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
topic as you look at the study committee
 
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
is pretty broad so that could be scoped
 
00:38:35.089 --> 00:38:35.099 align:start position:0%
in into their conversation Point
 
00:38:37.849 --> 00:38:37.859 align:start position:0%
um so the answer is I guess yes to that
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
the study committee can look at that and
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
and decide if there's action that's
 
00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:44.060 align:start position:0%
necessary but that was not the intent
 
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
Bea has done a commissioner Caswell it's
 
00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
done a great job at putting together as
 
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
a summary of of
 
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
um tourism in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
and Nev availability and and has a
 
00:38:58.970 --> 00:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
pretty good head start for the committee
 
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
representative Noel has a question thank
 
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
is it your intent in the bill or I'm
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
trying to understand who would be taking
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
the lead in
 
00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
in doing the installations would it be
 
00:39:23.089 --> 00:39:23.099 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire directing
 
00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:26.220 align:start position:0%
money out there or is it being are you
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
intending to encourage Private Industry
 
00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
is that the topic of discussion for the
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
commission so thank you and again that's
 
00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
going to be a commission but the
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
intention was not to have the state
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
install right it was this public-private
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
partnership kind of arrangements that we
 
00:39:40.609 --> 00:39:40.619 align:start position:0%
do on a regular basis in the state of
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we believe in but again my
 
00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
big concern was I think this is an
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
important issue and we know that and
 
00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:49.380 align:start position:0%
again there's people behind me can talk
 
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
in more detail but I know recently there
 
00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
was a two million dollar Push by puc to
 
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
have the utilities do the Make Ready
 
00:39:58.490 --> 00:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
work which again is going to be
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
recoverable cost for on rates and so
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
when I saw that I was a little concerned
 
00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
about that and one of the reasons I
 
00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
brought this forward is that is to have
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
the commission one of the things you
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
should look at is what the availability
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
is outside of forcing the utilities to
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
do this make ready work and push costs
 
00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:17.540 align:start position:0%
back down to ratepayers
 
00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you Sandra for taking my
 
00:40:25.849 --> 00:40:25.859 align:start position:0%
question uh as you probably know there
 
00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
is a house bill that's going to um
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
re-establish a commission for looking at
 
00:40:35.089 --> 00:40:35.099 align:start position:0%
EV charging stations to assess uh Road
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
fees that could be collected from them
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
do you see this as a potential of being
 
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
blended into that commission that they
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
could talk about instead of having all
 
00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
these other commissions can be scattered
 
00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:46.790 align:start position:0%
these other commissions can be scattered
everywhere

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
00:40:49.849 --> 00:40:49.859 align:start position:0%
so again I I guess I wouldn't be opposed
 
00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
to making that look but again my my view
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
again I did this as chair of ways and
 
00:40:57.290 --> 00:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
means is I'm more I was concerned about
 
00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
um our revenues as it relates to tourism
 
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
and what's going on with tourism and how
 
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
we can best use infrastructure to
 
00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
support tourism in our state which is
 
00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
the one of our Prime Revenue sources in
 
00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
representative merner has a question
 
00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
yes that you're on ways and means on the
 
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
Volkswagen mitigation fund has any of
 
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
that gone out
 
00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know whether it's gone out
 
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:22.740 align:start position:0%
but I did ask about that fund when in
 
00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
the original iteration of this bill and
 
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
what I found out was that it's only for
 
00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
behind the meter not in front of the
 
00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
meter it's been allocated but I don't
 
00:41:31.849 --> 00:41:31.859 align:start position:0%
know whether or not any actually I do
 
00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
know some of the revenues have been
 
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
spent I just don't know how many
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
yes uh before you follow up I want to
 
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
point out that uh Rebecca ohler is here
 
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:43.380 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Environmental
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
Services and she's available to answer
 
00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.670 align:start position:0%
Services and she's available to answer
questions

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
and she might be able to answer a
 
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
question about the Volkswagen mitigation
 
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
fund so just be aware of that okay
 
00:41:56.329 --> 00:41:56.339 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative Werner I guess
 
00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
you could do the follow-up on it no
 
00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.550 align:start position:0%
you could do the follow-up on it no
because

00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:01.079 align:start position:0%
when I I did a big ribbon cutting up at
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
the AMC Center they put a big charging
 
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
station up there which really helps a
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
lot of the people coming in
 
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
um that we hadn't even touched that
 
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
mitigation fund we had set out a new RFP
 
00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:12.300 align:start position:0%
and all the other states like Vermont
 
00:42:14.569 --> 00:42:14.579 align:start position:0%
Maine all this charging stations they
 
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
had already used all their money for the
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
for the Volkswagen fund that's why I was
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
asking the question with ways and means
 
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
well again so I I do know that Maine and
 
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
Vermont are way ahead of us in terms of
 
00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
how they're implementing and what
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
they're implementing and it's one of the
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
reasons why I have concern about New
 
00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:29.890 align:start position:0%
reasons why I have concern about New
Hampshire

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:29.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question Senator uh just
 
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
looking at this thing I'm trying to get
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
fathom this a little bit of talks on the
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
last page about identify additional and
 
00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
determine the feasibility of
 
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
non-rate-payer sources of funding which
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
first tells me there must be some rate
 
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
payer sources of funding then it lists a
 
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
bunch of other taxes uh only one of
 
00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:55.079 align:start position:0%
which seems to be specific to people who
 
00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
own electric vehicles so is this bill
 
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
encompassed that everybody some way or
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
the other is going to be paying for
 
00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:04.980 align:start position:0%
these charging stations whether you own
 
00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:07.079 align:start position:0%
an electric vehicle or not
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
so again that's up for the commission my
 
00:43:10.609 --> 00:43:10.619 align:start position:0%
point is I want to start the
 
00:43:10.619 --> 00:43:11.990 align:start position:0%
point is I want to start the
conversation

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:43:14.089 --> 00:43:14.099 align:start position:0%
so that would follow up
 
00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:16.980 align:start position:0%
follow up so under this bill that's
 
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
something they should be they could be
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
looking at to say so if I drive up from
 
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to go to Lake
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee I can go to a charging
 
00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:27.780 align:start position:0%
station for free possibly or however
 
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
well again so one of the things in here
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
if you look on that fourth page line
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
number three surcharges on electricity
 
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
purchase through the public vehicle
 
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
charging stations so they are looking at
 
00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
the possibility of surcharges again
 
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:41.460 align:start position:0%
there's no defined path if I had a
 
00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
defined path I wouldn't need a
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
commission the point of the commission
 
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
is to have the conversation see what the
 
00:43:47.329 --> 00:43:47.339 align:start position:0%
best path for New Hampshire is all right
 
00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:49.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:53.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question thank you
 
00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:56.700 align:start position:0%
for bringing this bill
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
um and uh I noticed that you mentioned
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation in the
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
bill and as a member of the easy board
 
00:44:07.609 --> 00:44:07.619 align:start position:0%
from the house we had a presentation
 
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
from dot about EV charging and what the
 
00:44:14.089 --> 00:44:14.099 align:start position:0%
sort of feds were coming down with a
 
00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
plan to try and make sure that this
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure from coast to coast it's
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
always a question of who knows what when
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
where we're all at in terms of changes
 
00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:24.260 align:start position:0%
in technology and infrastructure but
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
their presentation to us did provide
 
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.010 align:start position:0%
their presentation to us did provide
um

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
a plan that's being put in place for
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
where charging should be located in the
 
00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
state on the highways off the highways
 
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing so there was a sort
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
of a standard being applied from coast
 
00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
to coast
 
00:44:44.329 --> 00:44:44.339 align:start position:0%
uh similar to what they used to do with
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
gas stations to make sure people
 
00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
wouldn't run out so I didn't know how
 
00:44:49.609 --> 00:44:49.619 align:start position:0%
much they were involved in the
 
00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
discussions around this or how much it
 
00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:52.790 align:start position:0%
discussions around this or how much it
informed

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
informed
 
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:53.630 align:start position:0%
informed
um

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:55.849 --> 00:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
the inquiry so I did have conversation
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
they give you a question I did have
 
00:44:59.210 --> 00:44:59.220 align:start position:0%
conversations with Tes I'll said some
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
conversations with DOT again I think the
 
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
idea was to have a uniform plan well
 
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
they have a plan they don't have funding
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
sources who's going to pay for this is
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
the rate payer is it gonna that my
 
00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
concern was the cost of the work between
 
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
the pole and the meter and that and and
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
that is where this conversation came
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
from there is money available to federal
 
00:45:19.609 --> 00:45:19.619 align:start position:0%
government from behind the meter for the
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
people who buy the charging stations and
 
00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
do that but the Make Ready work was my
 
00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
concern because that's going to hit the
 
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
rate payers of New Hampshire and so the
 
00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:28.380 align:start position:0%
whole one of the points of the
 
00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
commission is to see if there's ways we
 
00:45:32.809 --> 00:45:32.819 align:start position:0%
can we can deal with that whether it's
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
the mitigation type of fund funding or
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise or I know there's a large
 
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
National infrastructure Bill coming or
 
00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
has passed I'm not sure where it is in
 
00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
the federal government at this point
 
00:45:43.849 --> 00:45:43.859 align:start position:0%
when I introduced a bill it hadn't
 
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
passed yet
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
um so again whether or not we can get a
 
00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
federal ear Mark that would allow us to
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
do some charging stations or not
 
00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:55.380 align:start position:0%
again my biggest concern is I don't want
 
00:45:56.329 --> 00:45:56.339 align:start position:0%
to move forward if it's going to cost
 
00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
every rate payer more money I want to
 
00:45:59.210 --> 00:45:59.220 align:start position:0%
find another solution and what that
 
00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:01.500 align:start position:0%
solution is maybe a surcharge it may be
 
00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
finding federal dollars it may be a
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
private partner relationship I don't
 
00:46:07.069 --> 00:46:07.079 align:start position:0%
know what that looks like hence the
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
reason for a commission follow-up yeah
 
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
and the follow-up would be I think under
 
00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note it mentions the 17.2
 
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:16.790 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note it mentions the 17.2
million

00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:19.410 align:start position:0%
under the nebby program and
 
00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:19.910 align:start position:0%
under the nebby program and
[Music]

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.770 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
15 million dedicated to the installation
 
00:46:26.089 --> 00:46:26.099 align:start position:0%
of EV Chargers so again you're you're
 
00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
still looking at the behind the meter
 
00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
connection costs
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
being passed on to rate payers and how
 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
we can look at it mitigate it figure out
 
00:46:38.089 --> 00:46:38.099 align:start position:0%
where it comes from correct okay thanks
 
00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and um over here
 
00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:47.460 align:start position:0%
yeah okay and uh thank you for uh for
 
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill it is a very
 
00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
important topic and I'm glad we need to
 
00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:53.220 align:start position:0%
not only talk about it but need to get
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
get to work
 
00:46:56.569 --> 00:46:56.579 align:start position:0%
um question for you is
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
um in addition to the commission this
 
00:47:01.609 --> 00:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
special commission being established the
 
00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:03.260 align:start position:0%
bill also
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
directs the Public Utilities Commission
 
00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
to complete some work over a two-year
 
00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
period And I guess I'm wondering if
 
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
there's going to be any if the those two
 
00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:13.380 align:start position:0%
commissions could end up working at
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
Cross purposes and and would it be more
 
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have the puc weight until
 
00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
the commission has completed their work
 
00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your question
 
00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
um Sam can Mr Brown can talk about that
 
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
because I think he's been trying to get
 
00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
that language Struck from this bill
 
00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
twice now and so he thinks the same he's
 
00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
in of the same mind that we should have
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
a single path
 
00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:38.420 align:start position:0%
thank you great minds think alike
 
00:47:40.609 --> 00:47:40.619 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:42.839 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
um whenever I bring up um Evie's uh on
 
00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
my town form or anything I always hear
 
00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:50.220 align:start position:0%
about the slavery of children mining
 
00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
lithium always that's a that's a really
 
00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:55.079 align:start position:0%
common talking point I'm sure you heard
 
00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
it about this Bill I'm wondering how did
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
you answer that talking point
 
00:48:02.809 --> 00:48:02.819 align:start position:0%
so again this bill isn't about EVS about
 
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
EV charging and and the federal
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
government you know California a bunch
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
of other others in Massachusetts has
 
00:48:11.329 --> 00:48:11.339 align:start position:0%
made commitments to improving to have
 
00:48:11.339 --> 00:48:12.710 align:start position:0%
made commitments to improving to have
EVS

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
EVS
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
um within their state in a certain
 
00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
percentage but that's not what this bill
 
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
is about so I don't want to get down the
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
weeds of that conversation I agree with
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
you I think that's a horrific issue and
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
and it needs to be addressed the mining
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
of these precious metals and and
 
00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:27.300 align:start position:0%
materials are a problem but that's not
 
00:48:28.849 --> 00:48:28.859 align:start position:0%
what this is about this is about the
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts has just
 
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
increased the Rev total of registered
 
00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
Vehicles by five percent in less than
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
two years and if New Hampshire doesn't
 
00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
do something to provide infrastructure
 
00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
support for those Vehicles we
 
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
potentially could lose Ways and Means
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
and and tourism Revenue in our state
 
00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:45.740 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang uh page two line 32
 
00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
mentions universal access and that's
 
00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
also in the current statute that that
 
00:48:59.210 --> 00:48:59.220 align:start position:0%
would be amended by this bill
 
00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
universal access can actually mean a lot
 
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
of different things in the context of
 
00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
the RSA and the bill
 
00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:08.700 align:start position:0%
do you know what it means
 
00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
I'm going to leave that to people
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
smarter behind me I don't have an answer
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.809 --> 00:49:17.819 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:49:20.329 --> 00:49:20.339 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has one
 
00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
my question just for clarification I
 
00:49:26.329 --> 00:49:26.339 align:start position:0%
know it mentions in the bill
 
00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
um page four line three surcharges and
 
00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:29.700 align:start position:0%
electricity purchased through public
 
00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle charging stations I
 
00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
just want to verify to clarify does that
 
00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:36.740 align:start position:0%
mean that I understand this covers the
 
00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
paying for the charging stations but is
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
there any risk to rate payers paying for
 
00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
the actual charging of vehicles
 
00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
so again this is a commission to study
 
00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
all of those issues my goal would be
 
00:49:50.569 --> 00:49:50.579 align:start position:0%
again that rate payers should never pay
 
00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
for the charging of someone else's
 
00:49:53.569 --> 00:49:53.579 align:start position:0%
vehicle and and the cost of electricity
 
00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
needs to be covered by the person who's
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
covering the whose vehicle that's being
 
00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
charged but again I you know this is a
 
00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
commission to look at all of those
 
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
issues and to make sure that they're
 
00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:04.980 align:start position:0%
addressed to make sure that there isn't
 
00:50:06.589 --> 00:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
um you know rate payers paying for
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle owners
 
00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
okay representative partial has a
 
00:50:15.599 --> 00:50:16.550 align:start position:0%
okay representative partial has a
question

00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
thank you chair of always and thank you
 
00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:20.220 align:start position:0%
for being here today
 
00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:20.870 align:start position:0%
for being here today
um

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
I keep on hearing the word commission
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
but I'm seeing on page three
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
um line 23 study committee established
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
and there's the difference between study
 
00:50:31.609 --> 00:50:31.619 align:start position:0%
commit I just want to make sure that I
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
do understand there is between the study
 
00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:35.220 align:start position:0%
committee and study Commission I'm sorry
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
you're correct it's a committee I was
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
using the words interchangeable other
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else have a question
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter has one uh I just
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
I had the same question so thank you for
 
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
clarifying that
 
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has another
 
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
question yes it's actually not a
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
question it's a clarification I I
 
00:50:59.870 --> 00:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
actually am an EV owner who's traveled
 
00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:01.380 align:start position:0%
out of state and I just wanted to let
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
people know that when you charge it's
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
the same as putting a gas pump in your
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
car you pay for it so that's how it
 
00:51:09.119 --> 00:51:12.170 align:start position:0%
car you pay for it so that's how it
works

00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:14.569 --> 00:51:14.579 align:start position:0%
further questions I have one quick
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
question for you
 
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
uh you in your testimony you made
 
00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
reference to make ready work
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
and on lines 18 through 20 of page one
 
00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
of the bill it talks about front of the
 
00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
meter or Utility side and the definition
 
00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:32.220 align:start position:0%
of that and talks about polls Wireless
 
00:51:36.109 --> 00:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:39.049 --> 00:51:39.059 align:start position:0%
was the purpose of that language to get
 
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
that definition into statute
 
00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:44.220 align:start position:0%
or is it referenced elsewhere in the
 
00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:45.710 align:start position:0%
or is it referenced elsewhere in the
bill

00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
so again remember this bill was amended
 
00:51:50.089 --> 00:51:50.099 align:start position:0%
so that was originally as part of the
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
conversation I had before that it was
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
the other languages ripped off in this
 
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
and and the and the committee was put on
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
it but I do think it's important because
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
that was the focus of what the
 
00:52:02.089 --> 00:52:02.099 align:start position:0%
conversation was about when I introduced
 
00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
this in the Senate Transportation was
 
00:52:05.089 --> 00:52:05.099 align:start position:0%
the front of the meter work the back of
 
00:52:08.569 --> 00:52:08.579 align:start position:0%
the meter work uh behind the meter has
 
00:52:08.579 --> 00:52:09.170 align:start position:0%
the meter work uh behind the meter has
um

00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
there's monies and private Partnerships
 
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:13.140 align:start position:0%
and other ways people can do that it was
 
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
my concern was the front of the me to
 
00:52:16.609 --> 00:52:16.619 align:start position:0%
work to make sure that it never got
 
00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
charged to a repair
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
so did the bill as introduced have
 
00:52:23.569 --> 00:52:23.579 align:start position:0%
language with regard to that that was
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
stripped out it did I believe if I
 
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
honestly have to go back and look at it
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
I can't remember but I believe it did
 
00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
because that was the focus the focus was
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
for me was to make ready work of the
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
front of the meter work and making sure
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
that utilities after like I said puc put
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
2 million told the utility to spend two
 
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
million dollars on Make Ready work and I
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
was concerned I was going to get pushed
 
00:52:44.569 --> 00:52:44.579 align:start position:0%
to ratepayers
 
00:52:46.609 --> 00:52:46.619 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter does have another
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
question thank you just one more we have
 
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
paid researchers here
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
um have you why not utilize their them
 
00:52:59.089 --> 00:52:59.099 align:start position:0%
to do their job rather than form yet
 
00:53:00.349 --> 00:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
another committee when we already have
 
00:53:03.049 --> 00:53:03.059 align:start position:0%
over a hundred
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
so again while while they they will
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
again I'm gonna answer this and this is
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
my my understanding although I could be
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
wrong so again unders trying to evaluate
 
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
and understand what the impact which
 
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
some of it I did do and is why I formed
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
the commission because we the point of a
 
00:53:22.849 --> 00:53:22.859 align:start position:0%
commission is or committee is to make
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
recommendation for the legal changes for
 
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
Law changes what we should Implement if
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
there is anything to implement into law
 
00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
and so while I did have some
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
conversations with research to talk
 
00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
about can we monetize how much ways it
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
means with you know our revenues would
 
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
potentially be reduced if we take no
 
00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
action and I had those conversations I
 
00:53:41.569 --> 00:53:41.579 align:start position:0%
felt it was more important to have more
 
00:53:47.089 --> 00:53:47.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:47.099 --> 00:53:48.609 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:53:48.609 --> 00:53:48.619 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
partial has a question
 
00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
thank you again chair
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
um it was mentioned earlier about uh
 
00:53:59.329 --> 00:53:59.339 align:start position:0%
including uh surcharges on uh electric
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
metering in order to support Road tax
 
00:54:03.359 --> 00:54:04.010 align:start position:0%
metering in order to support Road tax
um

00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
and there's also I know of another bill
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
that's that speaks of infrastructure for
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
EVS within the state and making sure
 
00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
that infrastructure is provided at the
 
00:54:14.089 --> 00:54:14.099 align:start position:0%
time of construction rather have to go
 
00:54:17.329 --> 00:54:17.339 align:start position:0%
back and retrofit whenever possible are
 
00:54:19.069 --> 00:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
you open to amendments that would
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
address these particular issues it seems
 
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
like they may fit within the study group
 
00:54:24.829 --> 00:54:24.839 align:start position:0%
however I know you don't want to make a
 
00:54:26.089 --> 00:54:26.099 align:start position:0%
Christmas tree out of this unless
 
00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
ornament too much
 
00:54:29.329 --> 00:54:29.339 align:start position:0%
I know this is a very smart committee
 
00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:30.660 align:start position:0%
and if you guys think it's in best
 
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
interest of the bill feel free
 
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
representative munz has another question
 
00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:39.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:42.049 --> 00:54:42.059 align:start position:0%
um I I guess you know now that I'm
 
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill and and realizing
 
00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:46.140 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about a study
 
00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
committee in light of the issues that
 
00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
you've raised which I think are all very
 
00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:52.970 align:start position:0%
you've raised which I think are all very
valid

00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:52.980 align:start position:0%
valid
 
00:54:54.829 --> 00:54:54.839 align:start position:0%
should it really be a commission so we
 
00:54:59.530 --> 00:54:59.540 align:start position:0%
have some outside input into the process
 
00:55:02.089 --> 00:55:02.099 align:start position:0%
so because
 
00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
I think it was last year we passed a
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
bill in chapter 14 that says that commit
 
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
once you start adding people from the
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
outside you have to make sure that the
 
00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
legislators outnumber the public
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
participants whereas if I create a
 
00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
committee you can have as many public
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
participants as you want I don't have to
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
worry about the number of legislators so
 
00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.849 --> 00:55:25.859 align:start position:0%
that's a new house rule actually
 
00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
okay see no further questions for
 
00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang I want to thank you for
 
00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
being here Senator enjoy the rest of
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
your day and I'll next call on Michael
 
00:55:35.809 --> 00:55:35.819 align:start position:0%
Licata from eversource to give us his
 
00:55:38.809 --> 00:55:38.819 align:start position:0%
perspective on this legislation proposed
 
00:55:38.819 --> 00:55:40.010 align:start position:0%
perspective on this legislation proposed
legislation

00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
good morning Michael Licata representing
 
00:55:56.089 --> 00:55:56.099 align:start position:0%
eversource in support of the bill uh I
 
00:55:58.609 --> 00:55:58.619 align:start position:0%
think the bill sponsor did a fine job
 
00:56:01.849 --> 00:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
talking about uh what the Bill's intent
 
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
is and what it's trying to uh the issue
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's trying to solve uh really the
 
00:56:09.609 --> 00:56:09.619 align:start position:0%
challenge that we see on the electric
 
00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
distribution side is that there are
 
00:56:16.609 --> 00:56:16.619 align:start position:0%
different levels of EV Chargers as I
 
00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
think the committee is aware one two and
 
00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
three uh by and large the level three
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
Chargers those are the most uh the fast
 
00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:28.140 align:start position:0%
Chargers superchargers uh direct current
 
00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:29.630 align:start position:0%
Chargers superchargers uh direct current
Chargers

00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
Chargers
 
00:56:32.089 --> 00:56:32.099 align:start position:0%
um because they pull so much electricity
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
in a very short period of time they can
 
00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
charge an EV for around 30 minutes
 
00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:39.660 align:start position:0%
compared to a level two charger which is
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
equivalent to sort of the hookup for
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
your electric stove or uh dryer which
 
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
could take you know eight to ten hours
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
um because of that it can result
 
00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
depending on the location that they're
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
getting installed the need for
 
00:56:58.730 --> 00:56:58.740 align:start position:0%
significant Make Ready work for the
 
00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
utility to make sure that the
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
electricity is there to to meet that
 
00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
demand and so uh as uh
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang that can be uh you know an
 
00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
economic barrier for the installation of
 
00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
these Chargers we certainly understand
 
00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
um that you know there is a an economic
 
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
development component of this and so we
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
think that a study committee looking to
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
review different options different
 
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
sources of funding Federal funding
 
00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
obviously there's there's quite a bit in
 
00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:32.220 align:start position:0%
recently past legislation at the federal
 
00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
level is is a good way to go and you
 
00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
know the utilities I think eversource
 
00:57:39.049 --> 00:57:39.059 align:start position:0%
stands ready to to work with the
 
00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:41.220 align:start position:0%
committee and provide our knowledge and
 
00:57:43.069 --> 00:57:43.079 align:start position:0%
expertise to try to help sort of crack
 
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
this problem and with that be happy to
 
00:57:46.609 --> 00:57:46.619 align:start position:0%
answer any questions the committee may
 
00:57:46.619 --> 00:57:47.510 align:start position:0%
answer any questions the committee may
have

00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:54.829 --> 00:57:54.839 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has one thank you
 
00:57:56.690 --> 00:57:56.700 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you Mr locata for
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:02.220 align:start position:0%
um since we have had uh we've been
 
00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
informed by many of the car
 
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
manufacturers in the country that are
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
the most popular that they're
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
transitioning uh toward more electric
 
00:58:09.359 --> 00:58:10.809 align:start position:0%
transitioning uh toward more electric
vehicle

00:58:10.809 --> 00:58:10.819 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
product uh has eversource undertaken any
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
planning uh in advance to kind of figure
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
out where they might need to have you
 
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
know level three charges versus other
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
types yeah we we do uh as you might
 
00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
imagine quite a bit of system planning
 
00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh we are you know we look at at Trends
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
and uh predictions on electric growth
 
00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:37.380 align:start position:0%
that are put out by ISO New England we
 
00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:39.180 align:start position:0%
run our own studies
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
um to to confirm that and you know it
 
00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:43.130 align:start position:0%
um to to confirm that and you know it
isn't

00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:43.140 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:45.049 align:start position:0%
isn't
um

00:58:45.049 --> 00:58:45.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:47.809 --> 00:58:47.819 align:start position:0%
we don't make predictions on you know
 
00:58:50.329 --> 00:58:50.339 align:start position:0%
hey in downtown Portsmouth they're going
 
00:58:53.089 --> 00:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
to install for level three EV Chargers
 
00:58:57.170 --> 00:58:57.180 align:start position:0%
therefore we need to do X Y and Z before
 
00:58:59.089 --> 00:58:59.099 align:start position:0%
um they would occur it's it is you know
 
00:59:01.609 --> 00:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
the utility uh business is very cost
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
cause or pays but we do look at at the
 
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
necessity of meeting demand making sure
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
that we have a robust and resilient
 
00:59:13.309 --> 00:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
distribution system to to meet what we
 
00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:16.380 align:start position:0%
expect uh from a reliability perspective
 
00:59:20.569 --> 00:59:20.579 align:start position:0%
and follow up follow up and does it does
 
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
it make it more difficult from your side
 
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
that many people like myself and my
 
00:59:27.049 --> 00:59:27.059 align:start position:0%
husband charge at home so you know
 
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
people don't have gas stations in their
 
00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
garages but in this case the ability to
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
power up for your needs may not
 
00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
necessarily be reliant on uh well
 
00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:40.220 align:start position:0%
located superchargers
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
so far home charging uh has has not been
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
um certainly is uh there's increased
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
Eevee adoption increased electrification
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
of the heating uh sector you know we
 
00:59:59.089 --> 00:59:59.099 align:start position:0%
continue to evaluate our infrastructure
 
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
is the Transformer that serves uh say a
 
01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:04.380 align:start position:0%
neighborhood correctly sized does it
 
01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:06.900 align:start position:0%
needs to get increased so those are our
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
continued evaluations right now
 
01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
um certainly the the rate of adoption in
 
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and even other New England
 
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
states it has not uh that's the best of
 
01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
my knowledge caused an issue with that
 
01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:22.140 align:start position:0%
but as greater electrification of these
 
01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
sectors occurs that is exactly the type
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
of planning that we we look at
 
01:00:29.569 --> 01:00:29.579 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
01:00:29.579 --> 01:00:36.589 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
question

01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:38.329 --> 01:00:38.339 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:41.220 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um projecting
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
forward uh and looking at all of the
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
rest stops we have on the interstates
 
01:00:49.609 --> 01:00:49.619 align:start position:0%
here in the state and the number of gas
 
01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
stations or pumps that are at each rest
 
01:00:57.049 --> 01:00:57.059 align:start position:0%
station if we were to get to that point
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
of number of EV stations and let's say
 
01:01:02.569 --> 01:01:02.579 align:start position:0%
hopefully before I'd ever use one that
 
01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
you can recharge in 10 minutes
 
01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
would that require additional
 
01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
transmission lines to be put in what
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
kind of infrastructure at that magnitude
 
01:01:14.809 --> 01:01:14.819 align:start position:0%
at that point would would we have to do
 
01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
then yeah that's a pretty rigorous
 
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
analysis uh that you're you're thinking
 
01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:23.819 align:start position:0%
about there
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
um that you know obviously I don't have
 
01:01:31.549 --> 01:01:31.559 align:start position:0%
uh has not been done uh that said
 
01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
um you know additional electric usage uh
 
01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
results in the need for additional
 
01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
infrastructure whether that's starting
 
01:01:41.809 --> 01:01:41.819 align:start position:0%
at the distribution system the
 
01:01:44.329 --> 01:01:44.339 align:start position:0%
transmission system and ultimately
 
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:46.140 align:start position:0%
um increased need for electric
 
01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:48.900 align:start position:0%
generation uh so I I think it's a fair
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
statement to say that uh increased
 
01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:54.660 align:start position:0%
adoption of electric vehicles increased
 
01:01:57.650 --> 01:01:57.660 align:start position:0%
adoption of you know electric heating
 
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
results in the need for additional
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
um uh investments in infrastructure
 
01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:08.339 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you so uh is it your
 
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
opinion that the study committee could
 
01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:12.660 align:start position:0%
perhaps even address that level of
 
01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
magnitude uh during the study committee
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
I I think that certainly the committee
 
01:02:23.809 --> 01:02:23.819 align:start position:0%
has a very wide uh scope and uh you know
 
01:02:25.849 --> 01:02:25.859 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I think it's really
 
01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:29.220 align:start position:0%
looking at the distribution level
 
01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
um make-ready work and different funding
 
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
sources but looking at projections for
 
01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle adoption uh which would
 
01:02:41.089 --> 01:02:41.099 align:start position:0%
I think play into to your question uh
 
01:02:44.809 --> 01:02:44.819 align:start position:0%
would be I think very helpful uh for the
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
committee to sort of level set where are
 
01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
we now where do we expect to go
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:55.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
and thanks Mike for being here
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
um your statement that it is the Make
 
01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
Ready work the um infrastructure between
 
01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.690 align:start position:0%
Ready work the um infrastructure between
the

01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know the distribution line and the
 
01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
trans to the Transformer to the charging
 
01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.109 align:start position:0%
trans to the Transformer to the charging
station

01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
station
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
um Rings very true to me in my personal
 
01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
experience uh
 
01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
charging even at
 
01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
so-called DC fast charger or
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
supercharger locations at say at The
 
01:03:29.329 --> 01:03:29.339 align:start position:0%
Mall of New Hampshire the Electrify
 
01:03:32.089 --> 01:03:32.099 align:start position:0%
America station there or or the same
 
01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
Electrify America station at the
 
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
Seabrook Walmart plaza I rarely
 
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
experienced the rate of charge that
 
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
would live up to
 
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
you know the billing uh I.E charging the
 
01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:48.839 align:start position:0%
car in 30 minutes and this these are at
 
01:03:51.289 --> 01:03:51.299 align:start position:0%
locations of course you know at malls
 
01:03:53.089 --> 01:03:53.099 align:start position:0%
existing malls where you would think
 
01:03:55.730 --> 01:03:55.740 align:start position:0%
that the infrastructure is enormous and
 
01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
robust is can you provide any any
 
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
insight as to why that might be the case
 
01:04:05.089 --> 01:04:05.099 align:start position:0%
and it personally it's sort of
 
01:04:09.049 --> 01:04:09.059 align:start position:0%
discouraging for the you know the few DC
 
01:04:11.569 --> 01:04:11.579 align:start position:0%
fast charging stations that do exist in
 
01:04:12.490 --> 01:04:12.500 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
at these locations that they actually
 
01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
don't deliver the rate of charge yeah
 
01:04:18.849 --> 01:04:18.859 align:start position:0%
that you would expect
 
01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
before you uh answer that question and
 
01:04:24.289 --> 01:04:24.299 align:start position:0%
I'm going to allow it but remember we
 
01:04:26.089 --> 01:04:26.099 align:start position:0%
need to confine our questions to the
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
bill before us
 
01:04:30.589 --> 01:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
go ahead I guess yeah I I I
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I I don't have insight
 
01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:35.460 align:start position:0%
into the the particulars of those uh
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
specific locations
 
01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
um I I couldn't say whether that's uh an
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
issue with the Chargers the we'll say
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
behind the meter work or uh an issue
 
01:04:45.599 --> 01:04:46.549 align:start position:0%
behind the meter work or uh an issue
with

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:04:49.549 --> 01:04:49.559 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh or an issue
 
01:04:49.559 --> 01:04:50.390 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh or an issue
with

01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
um you know the
 
01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
uh the infrastructure in front of the
 
01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
meter uh so you know if if the owner of
 
01:04:58.680 --> 01:04:59.930 align:start position:0%
meter uh so you know if if the owner of
those

01:04:59.930 --> 01:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:05:03.289 --> 01:05:03.299 align:start position:0%
um stations is not seeing uh you know
 
01:05:05.809 --> 01:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
the the performance and they identify it
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
as an issue uh on the front of the meter
 
01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
then certainly we would work with them
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
and uh to try to address that
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for
 
01:05:18.049 --> 01:05:18.059 align:start position:0%
uh representative Bernardi has a
 
01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
question and before we I allow that
 
01:05:22.609 --> 01:05:22.619 align:start position:0%
question I'd remind representative Wendy
 
01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
Thomas that we need to be careful about
 
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
touching the equipment here
 
01:05:29.329 --> 01:05:29.339 align:start position:0%
um we can get we have other people who
 
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
need to do that kind of thing so just
 
01:05:33.049 --> 01:05:33.059 align:start position:0%
just be careful yeah
 
01:05:35.329 --> 01:05:35.339 align:start position:0%
so um if if there's an issue like I
 
01:05:37.549 --> 01:05:37.559 align:start position:0%
couldn't see any speaker so do we have
 
01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:40.140 align:start position:0%
to notify somebody who do we notify we
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
really should okay all right okay
 
01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
I I'm not chastising you I'm just
 
01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:47.220 align:start position:0%
pointing out that that's that's a
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
reality that we have to live with okay
 
01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
01:05:55.849 --> 01:05:55.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker uh so Mr Lakota is
 
01:05:58.490 --> 01:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
the order of magnitude of federal funds
 
01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
that are referenced in the fiscal note
 
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
in in line with your expectation of how
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
much Make Ready work is going to be
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
necessary or are we way off or you know
 
01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
what what's your assessment of that
 
01:06:14.329 --> 01:06:14.339 align:start position:0%
I I
 
01:06:14.339 --> 01:06:16.730 align:start position:0%
I I
um

01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:19.799 align:start position:0%
I don't want to kick uh the the question
 
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
over to to miss Oller although she might
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
be better equipped to to speak to the
 
01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
availability of federal funds and their
 
01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
their potential uses
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
um it really is very difficult I had a
 
01:06:34.609 --> 01:06:34.619 align:start position:0%
number of these similar conversations in
 
01:06:37.069 --> 01:06:37.079 align:start position:0%
the Senate is really very difficult uh
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
to put one's arms around the scale of
 
01:06:40.849 --> 01:06:40.859 align:start position:0%
the need
 
01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
um and that's that's for a number of
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
reasons one how many of these fast
 
01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:49.140 align:start position:0%
Chargers are required what locations and
 
01:06:52.010 --> 01:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
then each location is very site specific
 
01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know you might be able to get by
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
with very minimal work to make that uh
 
01:06:59.690 --> 01:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
interconnection there could be areas
 
01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
that are more say well rural in nature
 
01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh you know an error bed and breakfast
 
01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing if they want to
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
attract folks uh that would require
 
01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of of investment so it is
 
01:07:15.289 --> 01:07:15.299 align:start position:0%
it's hard to get one's arms around it
 
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
because it is so very site-specific and
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
and we don't you know to representative
 
01:07:21.529 --> 01:07:21.539 align:start position:0%
Thomas's question you know how many of
 
01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:23.700 align:start position:0%
of these fast Chargers how many level
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
two Chargers are acceptable you know
 
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
could the in get by with a level two
 
01:07:31.849 --> 01:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
charger that charges Navy overnight so I
 
01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
I know that's probably an insufficient
 
01:07:35.569 --> 01:07:35.579 align:start position:0%
answer but um you know I think Miss
 
01:07:37.789 --> 01:07:37.799 align:start position:0%
ohler might be able to speak to
 
01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
the specifics of what funds could be
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
used for
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:07:45.049 --> 01:07:45.059 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I guess Miss Oller is
 
01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
listening uh you can anticipate my
 
01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:51.770 align:start position:0%
listening uh you can anticipate my
question

01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:53.700 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
locata uh I'll ask the same question I
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
asked before do you do you know what
 
01:08:02.809 --> 01:08:02.819 align:start position:0%
universal access means in the bill and
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
in the current RSA
 
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
um if you could point me to the section
 
01:08:12.289 --> 01:08:12.299 align:start position:0%
of the bill I apologize sure uh page two
 
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:21.169 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:08:21.169 --> 01:08:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for the reference
 
01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
I know that there is
 
01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:26.390 align:start position:0%
I know that there is
um

01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh on lines 10
 
01:08:33.769 --> 01:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
through uh I think 12 uh there is a
 
01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
discussion about uh needs to be
 
01:08:38.329 --> 01:08:38.339 align:start position:0%
accessible to the public 24 hours a day
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
seven days a week I think that was sort
 
01:08:43.090 --> 01:08:43.100 align:start position:0%
of the intent I know it doesn't quite
 
01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
align with universal access uh but I
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
think that was the intent to say that
 
01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:51.179 align:start position:0%
this is is available
 
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
um uh you know to the public follow-up
 
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
so so you don't interpret it as meaning
 
01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
that it could charge any EV or that it's
 
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh for people with with various
 
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
handicaps uh on the advice of council uh
 
01:09:14.209 --> 01:09:14.219 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that uh that is what it
 
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
means it is not uh specific to one car
 
01:09:20.269 --> 01:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
manufacturer for example Tesla uh is
 
01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
only equipped to to charge their own
 
01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:27.769 align:start position:0%
only equipped to to charge their own
cars

01:09:27.769 --> 01:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions from
 
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
the committee we're going to move along
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
here and I'm going to ask Sam and
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
business Brown of clean energy New
 
01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to give us uh his perspective
 
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
on this legislation
 
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:44.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:46.859 align:start position:0%
committee uh Sam Evans Brown executive
 
01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
director of clean energy New Hampshire
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
um I I thought I could answer some of
 
01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
the questions that I heard that that I
 
01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
knew the answers to but one was just uh
 
01:09:58.010 --> 01:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
swatted down so so I'll take on some of
 
01:09:59.570 --> 01:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
the other ones
 
01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
um I think that maybe just us to start
 
01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
though we should we should realize that
 
01:10:06.169 --> 01:10:06.179 align:start position:0%
there's there's also a tremendous
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity I mean there's a real
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
challenge when it comes to the adoption
 
01:10:10.669 --> 01:10:10.679 align:start position:0%
of electric vehicles and making sure the
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is in place but when it
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
comes to reducing electric rates there's
 
01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
there's a real opportunity here electric
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
vehicles represent the ultimate in
 
01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
flexible load you plug them in
 
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
um you know whenever whenever is
 
01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
convenience but they they don't
 
01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to charge the moment
 
01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
that you plug them in you can have them
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
programmed so that they'll respond to
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
price signals and can fill in The
 
01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:36.659 align:start position:0%
Valleys in our electric demand and for
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
those of you who are on this committee
 
01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:39.900 align:start position:0%
who are familiar with how utility rates
 
01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
are set it's a numerator and a
 
01:10:43.970 --> 01:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
denominator right there's is the cost of
 
01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure and then there's the
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
unit sales of how many kilowatt hours
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
you push over that infrastructure and if
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
you have more sales divided by divided
 
01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
by that that fixed cost
 
01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
um or maybe it's vice versa yeah flip it
 
01:10:58.970 --> 01:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
around my head every time that results
 
01:11:02.689 --> 01:11:02.699 align:start position:0%
in a lower kilowatt hour rate so the
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
fast Chargers however are a particular
 
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
challenge as you've heard the
 
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
infrastructure required for a fast
 
01:11:11.209 --> 01:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
charger can be very expensive but I
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
would suggest that that a a robust
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
network of fast Chargers is how we prime
 
01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
the pump so that we are able to realize
 
01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
the benefits of that flexible load for
 
01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
those of you who are EV owners you know
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
that it's not like having a gas car you
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
very very rarely use a fast charger
 
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
because you you charge you know it's
 
01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
like leaving your your house with a full
 
01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
tank every day how often would you need
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
to use a gas station if you left your
 
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
house with a full tank every day you'd
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
need it for road trips and day trips and
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's about it so we're not going to
 
01:11:42.649 --> 01:11:42.659 align:start position:0%
need the same number of fast Chargers
 
01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
that we have have gas stations will need
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
dramatically fewer but they're the
 
01:11:48.649 --> 01:11:48.659 align:start position:0%
safety blanket that help folks to adopt
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
EVS help them feel comfortable and that
 
01:11:52.490 --> 01:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
if the state designs its electric rates
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
appropriately we can reap tremendous
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
benefits in the tour in the in the form
 
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
of lower electric rates because of that
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
flexible load so uh that's that's my my
 
01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
Spiel on the rate impacts I also want to
 
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
mention Cobalt mining it's not lithium
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
mining that has had the uh the claims of
 
01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
slave labor it's Cobalt mining which the
 
01:12:12.169 --> 01:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle in industry has reacted
 
01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
to quite swiftly and is moving away from
 
01:12:16.669 --> 01:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
using Cobalt in the batteries lithium is
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
a a necessary element in Lithium-ion
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
batteries Cobalt is not there are other
 
01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
chemistries that you can they can use to
 
01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
avoid that problem which is happening
 
01:12:24.719 --> 01:12:25.910 align:start position:0%
avoid that problem which is happening
already

01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
um and and I think that's about all I
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
had to say because my other points were
 
01:12:33.169 --> 01:12:33.179 align:start position:0%
hit by previous speakers so I'm happy to
 
01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
take questions if folks have them thank
 
01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
you questions from the committee
 
01:12:39.050 --> 01:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
representative partial has one
 
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
I could share and uh welcome
 
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
you mentioned level 3 chargers which I
 
01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
understand your logic on that I've also
 
01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
heard a former question and I hope I can
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
get a little Indulgence on this one
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
as a parallel if I had a gas pump
 
01:12:57.770 --> 01:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
that didn't charge that didn't dispense
 
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
yeah or something that effect I would
 
01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
want the state to come in and make sure
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
that I'm getting my fair share as it
 
01:13:11.330 --> 01:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
were and we do that we do regulate gas
 
01:13:13.729 --> 01:13:13.739 align:start position:0%
pumps to your knowledge are these
 
01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
electric pumps that are electric
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
Chargers that are supposed to be
 
01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
operating at a certain percentage of a
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
certain time and time is money in this
 
01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:21.410 align:start position:0%
certain time and time is money in this
case

01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
um is there any Old State oversight on
 
01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
these electric Chargers as there is on
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
our gas pumps I'm so glad you asked this
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
question there is there is not and in in
 
01:13:33.649 --> 01:13:33.659 align:start position:0%
my mind it is a an issue that begs the
 
01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:34.669 align:start position:0%
my mind it is a an issue that begs the
solution

01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
solution
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
um there's their particular uh providers
 
01:13:39.169 --> 01:13:39.179 align:start position:0%
of charging that are that are uh
 
01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:41.340 align:start position:0%
notoriously worse actors on this front
 
01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
in terms of not uh maintaining their
 
01:13:45.649 --> 01:13:45.659 align:start position:0%
equipment and so you pull up to a
 
01:13:47.209 --> 01:13:47.219 align:start position:0%
station that has four plugs and only one
 
01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
of them is functioning and it's plugged
 
01:13:50.570 --> 01:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
into somebody else's car I do believe
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
that that cries out for a policy
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
solution because many of these Chargers
 
01:13:55.729 --> 01:13:55.739 align:start position:0%
have been built with public dollars and
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
then operations and maintenance are not
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
being sufficiently covered that said uh
 
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
that when I heard uh representative
 
01:14:04.729 --> 01:14:04.739 align:start position:0%
corman's representative Reynolds
 
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
question excuse me
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
um my first thought actually went to our
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
rate structures New Hampshire uh has
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
some of the utilities have particularly
 
01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
High demand charges which are which are
 
01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
it's incredibly difficult to operate a
 
01:14:18.649 --> 01:14:18.659 align:start position:0%
fast charger in a utility service
 
01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
territory that has a very high demand
 
01:14:22.490 --> 01:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
charge so some of the charging providers
 
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
throttle the capacity of their Chargers
 
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
in order to avoid very high demand
 
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
charges which is why we have been
 
01:14:30.649 --> 01:14:30.659 align:start position:0%
advocating for a number of years that we
 
01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
need to be investigating to mancharge
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
Alternatives especially in this this uh
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
sort of nascent phase uh so to to and
 
01:14:41.450 --> 01:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
maybe to uh to again pull the camera
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
back a little bit we're at a point where
 
01:14:45.649 --> 01:14:45.659 align:start position:0%
EV adoption is quite low but we're
 
01:14:47.090 --> 01:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
needing to build the infrastructure so
 
01:14:49.010 --> 01:14:49.020 align:start position:0%
that we're ready when EV adoption is
 
01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
hitting levels that that essentially
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
everyone at this point the manufacturers
 
01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
the the grid the grid operator are all
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
forecasting and it gets to
 
01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
um and and once we reach a level where
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
there are quite a lot of EVS on the road
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
there will be a business model that will
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
that will make it so that Chargers can
 
01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
be built profitably by private actors
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
there just aren't enough EVS on the road
 
01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:11.580 align:start position:0%
yet for that to be the case and so again
 
01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
you know if they if you build it they
 
01:15:15.649 --> 01:15:15.659 align:start position:0%
will come they are coming we have to
 
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh before I let you follow up
 
01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
I reminded the committee a little while
 
01:15:26.450 --> 01:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
ago when representative Reynolds asked
 
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
his question that if we Wander from the
 
01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
subject of the bill
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
it is somewhat discourteous to the
 
01:15:37.010 --> 01:15:37.020 align:start position:0%
members of the public who have come to
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
testify on the next bill
 
01:15:42.490 --> 01:15:42.500 align:start position:0%
if we prolong this public hearing
 
01:15:45.169 --> 01:15:45.179 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily so I'm going to allow your
 
01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
question but I'm going to remind
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
everyone that we really need to keep
 
01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
focus our questions on the on the
 
01:15:54.530 --> 01:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
subject of this bill and not wander off
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
to discuss
 
01:15:58.430 --> 01:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
issues that aren't really relevant to
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
the passage of this bill so now
 
01:16:16.669 --> 01:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative munz you
 
01:16:21.530 --> 01:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
have a question relevant to the bill I
 
01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:22.310 align:start position:0%
have a question relevant to the bill I
do

01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:16:25.010 --> 01:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
Evans Brown
 
01:16:28.610 --> 01:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
um I was very disappointed in your in
 
01:16:30.350 --> 01:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
your testimony because I waited with
 
01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
baited breath for the answer to the
 
01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
question I had posed earlier about the
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
puc's involvement and you were going to
 
01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
answer that yes uh so so the the that
 
01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:43.260 align:start position:0%
language I would characterize as being
 
01:16:45.890 --> 01:16:45.900 align:start position:0%
vestigial it's in statute already the
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
POC has conducted those dockets already
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
and we have numerous signs throughout
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
this process asked for that language to
 
01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:53.219 align:start position:0%
be struck and I think it has not been
 
01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
struck just because of cross wires and
 
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
communication and maybe
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
miscommunications about about the status
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
of those dockets so I would recommend
 
01:17:03.649 --> 01:17:03.659 align:start position:0%
that that those that language can be
 
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
removed from this bill and it would
 
01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
simply be cleaning up existing statute
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:11.580 align:start position:0%
I'll remind members to turn off your
 
01:17:13.010 --> 01:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
microphone when you're done speaking
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
Evans Brown for taking my question
 
01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
um I asked this question earlier and I'm
 
01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
thinking about your statement about how
 
01:17:26.689 --> 01:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
many EVS will start the day fully
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
charged and therefore don't need to use
 
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
fast charges often but we also do have a
 
01:17:34.370 --> 01:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
lot of people who live in situations
 
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
where they can't charge at home I
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
represent a district that has many
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings many big apartment
 
01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
buildings do you view this bill as being
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
helpful to these people
 
01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question I I would
 
01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
agree that if you are not able to charge
 
01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
at home you will be charging on the
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
exact same infrastructure that is being
 
01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
utilized by tourists and visitors so so
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
I absolutely agree I would also state
 
01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
that tourists and visitors don't
 
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily need fast Chargers again I
 
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
think we're sort of thinking of EVS as
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
if they were gas cars and thinking that
 
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
we will refuel them just like we do gas
 
01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
cars and I don't think that we will you
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
know I I personally think that we should
 
01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
uh be investing heavily in destination
 
01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
charging which is a slower charge at the
 
01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
place that you're that you're going to
 
01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
because there's a real benefit to
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
Economic Development to having a charger
 
01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
on your Main Street and having folks
 
01:18:24.649 --> 01:18:24.659 align:start position:0%
hanging out for a couple hours while
 
01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
they while they top off their EV so uh I
 
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
would I would argue that uh if we want
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
to do this in the most affordable way
 
01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
possible we should try to get renters to
 
01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
be charging overnight on a slow charger
 
01:18:36.890 --> 01:18:36.900 align:start position:0%
as well which would look more like uh
 
01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
publicly available on Street charging
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds you have a
 
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
question relevant to the bill
 
01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead I do thank you Mr chairman
 
01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
um referring back to representative
 
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
Muntz question earlier do you
 
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
think that this uh that the study
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
committee contemplated by this bill
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
might be more effective as a commission
 
01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh even if it required adding a a
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
legislator or two it strikes me that
 
01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
even without adding any legislators
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
this a study commission could include
 
01:19:16.370 --> 01:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
you know the dot a designee of the dot a
 
01:19:18.290 --> 01:19:18.300 align:start position:0%
designee of the Department of Economic
 
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
Development and you know A Private
 
01:19:21.770 --> 01:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
Industry member
 
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
without you know adding members
 
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
but it seems like might it take a
 
01:19:30.830 --> 01:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
broader uh membership
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
having not had the experience in my job
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
to have participated in many commissions
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
versus committees I don't feel qualified
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
to actually comment on which process
 
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
works better and but I can tell you that
 
01:19:43.729 --> 01:19:43.739 align:start position:0%
Cleaners New Hampshire would gladly
 
01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
participate fully in either process
 
01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
whatever the wisdom of the committee
 
01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:51.410 align:start position:0%
whatever the wisdom of the committee
decides

01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further for questions
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
from the committee I want to thank Mr
 
01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
Evans Brown for being here and
 
01:20:00.169 --> 01:20:00.179 align:start position:0%
reluctantly I will remind the committee
 
01:20:00.179 --> 01:20:01.310 align:start position:0%
reluctantly I will remind the committee
that

01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
Rebecca Oller from New Hampshire Des is
 
01:20:05.689 --> 01:20:05.699 align:start position:0%
here to answer questions if there are
 
01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
any so be thinking about that because we
 
01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
have one final speaker on this bill and
 
01:20:12.649 --> 01:20:12.659 align:start position:0%
that is Lynn zieber going from revision
 
01:20:12.659 --> 01:20:23.270 align:start position:0%
that is Lynn zieber going from revision
energy

01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:25.370 --> 01:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
turn this on here good morning
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
um chervos chair Thomas members of
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy committee
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
my name is Lindsey Burgoyne I serve as
 
01:20:31.970 --> 01:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
the Director of policy and government
 
01:20:34.490 --> 01:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
Affairs for revision energy as you know
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
revision energy is an employee owned
 
01:20:38.570 --> 01:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
construction company with over 385
 
01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
employees across New England and that's
 
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
a hundred staff here in New Hampshire
 
01:20:45.290 --> 01:20:45.300 align:start position:0%
between Brentwood and Enfield in 2022
 
01:20:47.450 --> 01:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
alone we installed 10 000 kilowatts of
 
01:20:49.729 --> 01:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
residential solar 24 megawatts of
 
01:20:51.530 --> 01:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
commercial solar and actually hundreds
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
of EV charging projects as well which is
 
01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
why we're here today we in fact own the
 
01:20:58.910 --> 01:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
only public charging stations here in
 
01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
Concord um located right here at the
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
general court lot we've learned a lot
 
01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
over time as we've installed these
 
01:21:07.490 --> 01:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
projects over the past five years and
 
01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
we're here today in support of the bill
 
01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
as you've already heard driving an EV
 
01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
other than a Tesla in New Hampshire is a
 
01:21:15.290 --> 01:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
little bit like driving into a charging
 
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
desert and we're really excited to to
 
01:21:20.350 --> 01:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
see opportunities to increase that and
 
01:21:22.610 --> 01:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
find find solutions that are going to
 
01:21:24.669 --> 01:21:24.679 align:start position:0%
work right here for us in New Hampshire
 
01:21:26.810 --> 01:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
as you know it's rare to find fast
 
01:21:28.370 --> 01:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
Chargers in rural low traffic or
 
01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
seasonal areas in the situ situation
 
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
will remain so with the extremely high
 
01:21:35.209 --> 01:21:35.219 align:start position:0%
costs um so we'll talk a little bit
 
01:21:36.649 --> 01:21:36.659 align:start position:0%
about what makes the business case for
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
EV charging in New Hampshire so poor and
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
how this bill will help and I promise
 
01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
not to repeat things that people have
 
01:21:44.330 --> 01:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
already said so we've talked a lot a
 
01:21:45.169 --> 01:21:45.179 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:21:47.810 --> 01:21:47.820 align:start position:0%
um or sorry talked a lot about the Make
 
01:21:50.450 --> 01:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
Ready costs and these can really
 
01:21:52.669 --> 01:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
ultimately be 30 percent of the capital
 
01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
cost the total cost for the projects
 
01:21:56.450 --> 01:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
we're pleased that the study committee
 
01:21:58.370 --> 01:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
will dive into this exact Challenge and
 
01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
evaluate both available and additional
 
01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
funding for prudent utility Make Ready
 
01:22:05.209 --> 01:22:05.219 align:start position:0%
Investments second there's also
 
01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
operational costs Sam spoke to this as
 
01:22:10.370 --> 01:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
well demand charge rates were originally
 
01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
designed for steady power sources such
 
01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
as in a factory and as we know EV
 
01:22:18.410 --> 01:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
Chargers have really spiky load profiles
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
um so demand charges can can be over 70
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
percent of a bill that can ultimately
 
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
crush the business model as it's
 
01:22:27.649 --> 01:22:27.659 align:start position:0%
unfeasible to pass them on to drivers
 
01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
um during the early days of EV adoption
 
01:22:33.770 --> 01:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
um again that Mr Evans Brown spoke to so
 
01:22:35.810 --> 01:22:35.820 align:start position:0%
um we are pleased that this bill
 
01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
addresses this and we also feel that
 
01:22:39.649 --> 01:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
most other pucs and Utilities in the
 
01:22:40.970 --> 01:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
Northeast have designed a variety of
 
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
programs that phase out over time to
 
01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
successfully spur investment in both
 
01:22:48.649 --> 01:22:48.659 align:start position:0%
urban and rural charging stations so we
 
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
feel like there are really effective
 
01:22:52.250 --> 01:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
models that we could bring forth to do
 
01:22:54.410 --> 01:22:54.420 align:start position:0%
this work quickly we did want to note
 
01:22:56.330 --> 01:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
lastly that the amendment for this Bill
 
01:22:58.610 --> 01:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
calls calls out to the importance of not
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
increasing cost to ratepayers and that
 
01:23:03.649 --> 01:23:03.659 align:start position:0%
if EVS are charged during off-peak hours
 
01:23:05.930 --> 01:23:05.940 align:start position:0%
or overnight which most EV owners do
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
actually without an incentive it will
 
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
actually drive down rates for everyone
 
01:23:12.410 --> 01:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
and adds incremental Revenue to
 
01:23:15.649 --> 01:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
utilities essentially because when we're
 
01:23:18.169 --> 01:23:18.179 align:start position:0%
looking at that load is lowest on the
 
01:23:19.970 --> 01:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
grid and that means that that ISO
 
01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to increase generation
 
01:23:23.570 --> 01:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
during those nighttime hours there are
 
01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
quite a few studies there that I'd be
 
01:23:26.930 --> 01:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
happy to share with the committee we're
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
confident that there are many effective
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
models and research to support and
 
01:23:32.209 --> 01:23:32.219 align:start position:0%
enable the study committee and if the
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
puc is to to work on this as well to
 
01:23:37.070 --> 01:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
quickly advance electrification so thank
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
you very much we urge you to pass sb52
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
and happy to take any questions
 
01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony questions
 
01:23:45.530 --> 01:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative Wendy
 
01:23:48.410 --> 01:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
Thomas as one thank you Mr chair you
 
01:23:50.209 --> 01:23:50.219 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you have some Chargers
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
here in Concord now Tesla's not really
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
playing Fair because you can only charge
 
01:23:57.470 --> 01:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
Teslas with their Chargers we've heard
 
01:23:59.630 --> 01:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
about Universal are your chargers
 
01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
Universal and does that include Tesla
 
01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:02.930 align:start position:0%
Universal and does that include Tesla
cars

01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
cars
 
01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
um I am happy to get that answer for you
 
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
I am still four weeks into the job here
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
at revision congratulations thank you my
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
colleague James penfold has that um and
 
01:24:12.649 --> 01:24:12.659 align:start position:0%
they'd be happy to to pull that for you
 
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
before the work session this afternoon
 
01:24:18.649 --> 01:24:18.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:20.450 --> 01:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
seeing that I want to thank you thanks
 
01:24:23.570 --> 01:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
for being here and with no other pink
 
01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:27.719 align:start position:0%
cards in hand other than that of Rebecca
 
01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
ohler from the Department of
 
01:24:31.729 --> 01:24:31.739 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services I'll give the
 
01:24:33.410 --> 01:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
committee one last chance to ask
 
01:24:37.729 --> 01:24:37.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:39.770 --> 01:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Vos members of the
 
01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:41.219 align:start position:0%
committee Rebecca Oller Department of
 
01:24:43.490 --> 01:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services
 
01:24:46.729 --> 01:24:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has one
 
01:24:49.679 --> 01:24:51.410 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has one
the

01:24:51.410 --> 01:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
been raised a few times regarding
 
01:24:55.370 --> 01:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
lithium I know that in Maine they've
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
discovered a large lithium mine do you
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
know if there's any lithium in New
 
01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is not an area of
 
01:25:03.530 --> 01:25:03.540 align:start position:0%
expertise of mine
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
remember questions are about the bill
 
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yes back to uh the
 
01:25:16.669 --> 01:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
question I asked earlier are the federal
 
01:25:20.810 --> 01:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
monies referenced in the fiscal note in
 
01:25:24.050 --> 01:25:24.060 align:start position:0%
any way related to the amount of money
 
01:25:27.649 --> 01:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
you would expect needed to accomplish
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
the Make Ready work such that the rate
 
01:25:33.770 --> 01:25:33.780 align:start position:0%
payer is not on the hook for any build
 
01:25:36.770 --> 01:25:36.780 align:start position:0%
out thank you for your question so the
 
01:25:39.890 --> 01:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
there are two Uh current sources of
 
01:25:42.110 --> 01:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
funding for EV charging 4.6 million
 
01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
dollars from a Volkswagen settlement
 
01:25:48.169 --> 01:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
um and Des is in charge of of in charge
 
01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
of sorry uh responsible for Distributing
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
those funds and uh 17 and change million
 
01:25:57.530 --> 01:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
that the department of of transportation
 
01:26:00.410 --> 01:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
is uh going to be Distributing through
 
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
the national electric vehicle
 
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
infrastructure program
 
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh that is not enough money to do a full
 
01:26:10.189 --> 01:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
build out for fast charging with our 4.6
 
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
million we have four four stations that
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
have already made it through the or four
 
01:26:15.649 --> 01:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
proposals that have made it through the
 
01:26:16.930 --> 01:26:16.940 align:start position:0%
governor and Council process
 
01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
Peterborough Errol Lancaster and Med
 
01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
nadnock we have another eight to ten
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
locations that we will be able to fund
 
01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
so with 4.6 million we are going to get
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
in the neighborhood of 12 to 14 stations
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
built that include fast charging plus
 
01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
level two uh because not all electric
 
01:26:38.810 --> 01:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
vehicles can utilize a fast charger
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
so you know that makes 30 it's to if you
 
01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
assume that uh
 
01:26:46.970 --> 01:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
with the with the Navy there's you know
 
01:26:49.729 --> 01:26:49.739 align:start position:0%
about three times that four times that
 
01:26:53.629 --> 01:26:53.639 align:start position:0%
you know we're looking at 30 40 to 50
 
01:26:57.610 --> 01:26:57.620 align:start position:0%
stations Statewide Max I would say
 
01:27:00.770 --> 01:27:00.780 align:start position:0%
but again the purpose of these funds is
 
01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:03.780 align:start position:0%
not to try to create an entire network
 
01:27:05.689 --> 01:27:05.699 align:start position:0%
of charging stations the purpose of both
 
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
of these pots of funding is to lay the
 
01:27:11.149 --> 01:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
framework so that
 
01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:12.540 align:start position:0%
um you know back to the if you buy it
 
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
they will you know if you build it they
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
will come it's to enable the use of EVS
 
01:27:20.570 --> 01:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
throughout the region and and New
 
01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is often referred to as the
 
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
charging desert and it's because we've
 
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
we've not had the funding to invest in
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
so maybe this bill should be called the
 
01:27:34.370 --> 01:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
if you build it they will come that's
 
01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:35.149 align:start position:0%
if you build it they will come that's
right

01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you thank you for
 
01:27:41.090 --> 01:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'll ask the same
 
01:27:43.729 --> 01:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
question that I asked uh previously do
 
01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
you believe that the the the the
 
01:27:48.649 --> 01:27:48.659 align:start position:0%
information uh that is wanted in this
 
01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
01:27:52.129 --> 01:27:52.139 align:start position:0%
um and the fact that we have another
 
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
study commission involving charity
 
01:27:58.430 --> 01:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
stations and uh receiving uh road fee
 
01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
revenue from them do you think the two
 
01:28:02.930 --> 01:28:02.940 align:start position:0%
of them could be combined or instead of
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
having two two separate two separate
 
01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:06.110 align:start position:0%
having two two separate two separate
ones

01:28:06.110 --> 01:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
ones
 
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:28:10.729 --> 01:28:10.739 align:start position:0%
um as Mr Evans Brown discussed the the
 
01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
committee that is discussed in here has
 
01:28:14.689 --> 01:28:14.699 align:start position:0%
already happened
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
um doesn't mean that there's nothing
 
01:28:18.530 --> 01:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
left to discuss but I guess I would
 
01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
agree that we do not need two separate
 
01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:21.410 align:start position:0%
agree that we do not need two separate
bodies

01:28:21.410 --> 01:28:21.420 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
01:28:23.810 --> 01:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
discussing the same questions
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
follow up if uh yes there's a we passed
 
01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
a bill in the house to extend the uh
 
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
commission for figuring out a way to to
 
01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
collect Road fees from EV charging
 
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
stations along our Corridor and so
 
01:28:45.290 --> 01:28:45.300 align:start position:0%
that's the commission that was extended
 
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
so that was the question the commission
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
I was referring to as to whether or not
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
we could either you know combine them
 
01:28:53.570 --> 01:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
instead of having two two separate ones
 
01:28:55.510 --> 01:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification having
 
01:28:58.729 --> 01:28:58.739 align:start position:0%
participated on a previous version of
 
01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
that other commission I think that there
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
are different questions that are being
 
01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
discussed and no I do not see that as a
 
01:29:07.370 --> 01:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
good mix between the two
 
01:29:09.410 --> 01:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki has a question
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
for you okay thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
um I realized that there are site issues
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
and so forth that would affect this but
 
01:29:21.050 --> 01:29:21.060 align:start position:0%
what is the approximate cost per uh
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
level 3 charging station uh you've kind
 
01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
of threw some numbers around but I
 
01:29:26.450 --> 01:29:26.460 align:start position:0%
wasn't fast enough with the calculator
 
01:29:29.090 --> 01:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
to try to figure it out for myself but
 
01:29:30.649 --> 01:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
you know how much are they how much does
 
01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
one cost because then clearly we've got
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
a thank you for your question
 
01:29:37.729 --> 01:29:37.739 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
01:29:40.430 --> 01:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
the Chargers themselves depending on
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
which you know make and model you go
 
01:29:44.689 --> 01:29:44.699 align:start position:0%
with a single direct current fast
 
01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
charger that would be capable of of
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
charging two vehicles simultaneously is
 
01:29:52.490 --> 01:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
going to be in the between 100 and 150
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
000 it could go a little on either side
 
01:29:56.810 --> 01:29:56.820 align:start position:0%
of that really depends on make and model
 
01:30:00.290 --> 01:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
uh and and how it's structured the the
 
01:30:03.050 --> 01:30:03.060 align:start position:0%
big cost the big variable comes with
 
01:30:05.209 --> 01:30:05.219 align:start position:0%
where are you located in the state and
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
does the existing electrical
 
01:30:08.810 --> 01:30:08.820 align:start position:0%
infrastructure exist at that location to
 
01:30:10.729 --> 01:30:10.739 align:start position:0%
be able to support does it you know
 
01:30:12.050 --> 01:30:12.060 align:start position:0%
basically is there a three-phase power
 
01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:14.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's available in the area if
 
01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:15.649 align:start position:0%
that's that's available in the area if
not

01:30:15.649 --> 01:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:30:18.050 --> 01:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
um either it's not going to be viable or
 
01:30:19.729 --> 01:30:19.739 align:start position:0%
it's going to be wildly expensive to
 
01:30:21.770 --> 01:30:21.780 align:start position:0%
bring in three-phase power
 
01:30:24.590 --> 01:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
um to to enable that station or even if
 
01:30:26.689 --> 01:30:26.699 align:start position:0%
it's just in the area but but upgrades
 
01:30:29.209 --> 01:30:29.219 align:start position:0%
are going to be needed you'd get into a
 
01:30:31.010 --> 01:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
lot of costs in terms of Transformers
 
01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:30:36.110 --> 01:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
um site work site preparation some of
 
01:30:39.290 --> 01:30:39.300 align:start position:0%
which are on the Utility side of the
 
01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
meter and some of which are on the
 
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
customer side of the meter and so there
 
01:30:48.530 --> 01:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
um the VW trust that was awarded years
 
01:30:57.649 --> 01:30:57.659 align:start position:0%
ago before there was any discussion
 
01:31:00.890 --> 01:31:00.900 align:start position:0%
about EV Chargers EV Vehicles were there
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
any restrictions on how that money could
 
01:31:05.930 --> 01:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
be spent yes there are restrictions
 
01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:06.590 align:start position:0%
be spent yes there are restrictions
um

01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:08.209 --> 01:31:08.219 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head I can't even
 
01:31:10.490 --> 01:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
remember what the total award to New
 
01:31:12.770 --> 01:31:12.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was but only 15 percent of it
 
01:31:14.570 --> 01:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
may be used for electric vehicle
 
01:31:17.090 --> 01:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
charging infrastructure the rest needs
 
01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
to be used to replace diesel vehicles
 
01:31:21.050 --> 01:31:21.060 align:start position:0%
with either non-diesel vehicles or
 
01:31:22.729 --> 01:31:22.739 align:start position:0%
cleaner diesel vehicles because the
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
violation from Volkswagen was based on
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
diesel emissions
 
01:31:29.689 --> 01:31:29.699 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
01:31:31.729 --> 01:31:31.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question so yeah I'm looking
 
01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
at this the the numbers you gave 4.6
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
million gets you 12 to 14 stations that
 
01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
sounds like a lot per station but I'm
 
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
thinking well what's the alternative and
 
01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
the alternative would be the current
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure we have for
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
gasoline-powered vehicles uh
 
01:31:54.530 --> 01:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
can you provide any comparison what's
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
the cost of creating a gas station and
 
01:32:02.209 --> 01:32:02.219 align:start position:0%
getting the fuel to the gas station
 
01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
repeatedly is is there any way to
 
01:32:06.290 --> 01:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
compare those I'm going to ask you not
 
01:32:07.850 --> 01:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
to answer that question it's too off
 
01:32:11.209 --> 01:32:11.219 align:start position:0%
topic with respect representative Corman
 
01:32:11.219 --> 01:32:12.229 align:start position:0%
topic with respect representative Corman
I

01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:32:14.570 --> 01:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
would you take that offline and ask her
 
01:32:17.209 --> 01:32:17.219 align:start position:0%
maybe later on for the for an answer to
 
01:32:17.219 --> 01:32:17.930 align:start position:0%
maybe later on for the for an answer to
that

01:32:17.930 --> 01:32:17.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
representative muns you have a question
 
01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
about the Bill yes
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
um I I wanted to uh thank you Mr chair
 
01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question I
 
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
want to follow up on uh representative
 
01:32:31.310 --> 01:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
lewicki's question and your and your
 
01:32:33.229 --> 01:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
answer to that question
 
01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
um the the cost uh that the the the cost
 
01:32:41.149 --> 01:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
that you referenced is that just to
 
01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
install the station the EV charging
 
01:32:45.709 --> 01:32:45.719 align:start position:0%
station or does that also cover some of
 
01:32:47.629 --> 01:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
those those additional costs that you
 
01:32:49.310 --> 01:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
referred to of you know getting the
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
power to the station well the the cost
 
01:32:53.629 --> 01:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
for the station itself for the charging
 
01:32:55.370 --> 01:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
unit itself again is going to be you
 
01:32:58.010 --> 01:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
know anywhere from I don't know 75 000
 
01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
to 150 000 depending on the unit that
 
01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
um but the the cost to install can range
 
01:33:10.090 --> 01:33:10.100 align:start position:0%
widely I think some of our VW proposals
 
01:33:13.370 --> 01:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
are you know maybe only 50 000 over the
 
01:33:15.290 --> 01:33:15.300 align:start position:0%
cost of the actual charging stations and
 
01:33:18.290 --> 01:33:18.300 align:start position:0%
other ones are 250 000 over because just
 
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
the the infrastructure doesn't exist
 
01:33:23.689 --> 01:33:23.699 align:start position:0%
they need multiple Transformers um it's
 
01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
01:33:31.729 --> 01:33:31.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Miss
 
01:33:33.890 --> 01:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
Ola for taking my question
 
01:33:35.689 --> 01:33:35.699 align:start position:0%
um the last I heard from you I think was
 
01:33:37.490 --> 01:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
in the easy an easy board meeting where
 
01:33:39.770 --> 01:33:39.780 align:start position:0%
you gave us an update and you were
 
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
taking over the RFP process for that
 
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
Volkswagen money in order to get some
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
people to be bidding on creating this
 
01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
plan that you're referring to now so is
 
01:33:52.610 --> 01:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
the cost that you're providing for those
 
01:33:55.790 --> 01:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
12 to 14 stations based on the selection
 
01:33:57.709 --> 01:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
of one of those vendors in the RFP
 
01:34:01.550 --> 01:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
process is that how you got there yes
 
01:34:02.810 --> 01:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:05.810 --> 01:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
um we received off the top of my head I
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
can't tell you exactly how many but
 
01:34:09.050 --> 01:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
about 20 different proposals for
 
01:34:11.450 --> 01:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
charging infrastructure they were site
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
specific we were not seeking a single
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
vendor to build out across the state we
 
01:34:17.689 --> 01:34:17.699 align:start position:0%
were we were seeking locations and so
 
01:34:22.129 --> 01:34:22.139 align:start position:0%
that that cost that is the is the um
 
01:34:24.290 --> 01:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
number of different locations that we
 
01:34:26.570 --> 01:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
would be able to find follow-up
 
01:34:29.810 --> 01:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
follow-up so if I'm following what
 
01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
you're saying correctly
 
01:34:34.610 --> 01:34:34.620 align:start position:0%
um different vendors bid on different
 
01:34:37.129 --> 01:34:37.139 align:start position:0%
location build out so you you're working
 
01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
with multiple vendors rather than one
 
01:34:41.090 --> 01:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
yes correct
 
01:34:43.370 --> 01:34:43.380 align:start position:0%
um in some cases the applicant was the
 
01:34:45.709 --> 01:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
was the company or individual that owns
 
01:34:48.050 --> 01:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
the site and they picked their project
 
01:34:50.750 --> 01:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
Partners in other applications the
 
01:34:52.729 --> 01:34:52.739 align:start position:0%
applicant was the the charging company
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
and they had gone out and found a
 
01:34:54.719 --> 01:34:55.910 align:start position:0%
and they had gone out and found a
location

01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
location
 
01:34:59.090 --> 01:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
um so we've we're going at this from two
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
or three different sides
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay I'm I want to thank you Miss ohler
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
for being here I'm getting the sense
 
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
that the committee is struggling with
 
01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:09.380 align:start position:0%
coming up with questions about the bill
 
01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
and uh we're not here to have a general
 
01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
discussion about EV charging so I want
 
01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
to thank you and uh since you're the
 
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
last pink card I have I'm going to close
 
01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:23.159 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on Senate Bill 52 and
 
01:35:25.850 --> 01:35:25.860 align:start position:0%
I will open a public hearing on Senate
 
01:35:29.209 --> 01:35:29.219 align:start position:0%
Bill 54 and ask Senator David Waters to
 
01:35:32.090 --> 01:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
introduce this legislation to US senator
 
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
Waters thank you for being patient thank
 
01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
you Mr President I didn't know if Greg
 
01:35:37.250 --> 01:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
Moore was going to be here to do the
 
01:35:40.189 --> 01:35:40.199 align:start position:0%
first take on this or not is he
 
01:35:43.850 --> 01:35:43.860 align:start position:0%
or somebody from the Senate Office
 
01:35:45.709 --> 01:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
okay I guess it's me all right there's
 
01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:51.649 --> 01:35:51.659 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr uh chairman and members
 
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
of the committee Senator David Waters
 
01:35:55.370 --> 01:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
District Four to introduce some
 
01:35:57.530 --> 01:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 54 relative to the purchase
 
01:35:58.850 --> 01:35:58.860 align:start position:0%
power agreements for electric
 
01:36:01.490 --> 01:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities and Senator avard
 
01:36:04.010 --> 01:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
is uh out of the out of the state this
 
01:36:06.050 --> 01:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
week so I'm glad to be here as he and I
 
01:36:09.649 --> 01:36:09.659 align:start position:0%
were the two co-sponsors on this bill
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
um if I may uh Mr chairman just a few
 
01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
words of context on this bill we all
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
recall over the last year what has
 
01:36:18.290 --> 01:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
happened with the egregious spikes and
 
01:36:22.370 --> 01:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
energy costs and even last summer
 
01:36:24.110 --> 01:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
Senator Dave Arden and I started to talk
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
about what other
 
01:36:28.250 --> 01:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
states were doing about this and of
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
course we got to December when
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
eversource had to go into the
 
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
energy Market it really about the worst
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
possible time because we require them
 
01:36:39.169 --> 01:36:39.179 align:start position:0%
every six months to go in and people
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
noticed that New Hampshire energy Co-op
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
electric energy Co-op which uh could you
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
know stack their contracts and have
 
01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
longer periods for a while had much
 
01:36:51.770 --> 01:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
reduced costs so that was the origin of
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
um of this of this bill and you will
 
01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
notice that there are a lot of changes
 
01:36:58.669 --> 01:36:58.679 align:start position:0%
made in the Senate on the bill because
 
01:37:01.810 --> 01:37:01.820 align:start position:0%
it started out specifying only renewable
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
sources is what Senator Evart had come
 
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
up with but I think we came up with a
 
01:37:08.450 --> 01:37:08.460 align:start position:0%
much better Bill and one that I really
 
01:37:10.610 --> 01:37:10.620 align:start position:0%
can thank Chris Elms and doe in the
 
01:37:12.530 --> 01:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
governor's office and you know
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the on the committee and
 
01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
Advocates coming towards a bill which we
 
01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
think will help lower New Hampshire
 
01:37:22.010 --> 01:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
Electric costs and I think also achieve
 
01:37:23.689 --> 01:37:23.699 align:start position:0%
some of the goals of the original bill
 
01:37:26.709 --> 01:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
to help us to diversify our our energy
 
01:37:30.890 --> 01:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
energy resources and uh you know in
 
01:37:33.229 --> 01:37:33.239 align:start position:0%
particular it does go to
 
01:37:35.090 --> 01:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
um fuel neutral you know that the the
 
01:37:37.070 --> 01:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
utilities can go to any Source but it's
 
01:37:38.689 --> 01:37:38.699 align:start position:0%
it's my feeling in this bill and the
 
01:37:40.610 --> 01:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
framework of it and just where things
 
01:37:42.110 --> 01:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
are in the industry that it really is
 
01:37:44.689 --> 01:37:44.699 align:start position:0%
going to mean that newer newer energy
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
and more renewable energy resources will
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
have a good opportunity for the
 
01:37:50.649 --> 01:37:50.659 align:start position:0%
utilities to take advantage of the
 
01:37:53.810 --> 01:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
reduction costs of providing a new
 
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
generation from those those services so
 
01:37:57.590 --> 01:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
I think we've you know very good a very
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
good approach here and one which I think
 
01:38:02.450 --> 01:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
we can we can get get through and have
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
some success with um depending on the
 
01:38:07.490 --> 01:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
wisdom of this of this committee
 
01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
so the findings are what they are
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
um it does certainly uh call out the
 
01:38:14.270 --> 01:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
Natural Gas
 
01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:16.370 align:start position:0%
Natural Gas
issue

01:38:16.370 --> 01:38:16.380 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:38:18.649 --> 01:38:18.659 align:start position:0%
um and retirement of baseball generation
 
01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
resources and of course there's a big
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
International context here and you know
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
my own feeling was that we also as a
 
01:38:27.890 --> 01:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
state have fewer of alternative
 
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
um sources than some of our other states
 
01:38:31.250 --> 01:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
around us who have developed other
 
01:38:33.890 --> 01:38:33.900 align:start position:0%
sources more quickly but be that as it
 
01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:34.669 align:start position:0%
sources more quickly but be that as it
may

01:38:34.669 --> 01:38:34.679 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
um you know on line seven and eight
 
01:38:39.550 --> 01:38:39.560 align:start position:0%
we've got to find develop reliable
 
01:38:43.490 --> 01:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
low-cost electric supplies and have a
 
01:38:45.770 --> 01:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
contract structure which lets us take
 
01:38:48.410 --> 01:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
advantage of of those for the people of
 
01:38:50.209 --> 01:38:50.219 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
um so what this does is that it allows
 
01:38:55.610 --> 01:38:55.620 align:start position:0%
uh electric distribution companies to
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
enter under purchase propose and enter
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
into purchase power agreements
 
01:39:02.209 --> 01:39:02.219 align:start position:0%
potentially up to 20 years but for
 
01:39:04.129 --> 01:39:04.139 align:start position:0%
different lengths than than what their
 
01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
required uh to do now I think that word
 
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
there uh May is important
 
01:39:11.870 --> 01:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
um some states mandate this I think for
 
01:39:14.689 --> 01:39:14.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as it says in line 18 and
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
elsewhere May utilities may elect to
 
01:39:18.530 --> 01:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
this state they're the good judges of
 
01:39:20.270 --> 01:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
the markets and what energy resource is
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
going to be out there and uh I think
 
01:39:23.930 --> 01:39:23.940 align:start position:0%
that will that that's the kind of
 
01:39:25.970 --> 01:39:25.980 align:start position:0%
flexibility that that we need and gets
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
us away from a state mandate as well
 
01:39:30.590 --> 01:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
which is important
 
01:39:33.770 --> 01:39:33.780 align:start position:0%
you'll notice on 21 to 24 I think
 
01:39:36.890 --> 01:39:36.900 align:start position:0%
another very important area of
 
01:39:39.550 --> 01:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
flexibility here in these purchase power
 
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
agreements because it is quite possible
 
01:39:46.010 --> 01:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
that one utility can leverage a better
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
price in a contract if they go in with
 
01:39:52.370 --> 01:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
other utilities and one crucial change
 
01:39:54.590 --> 01:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
that we made here is to say that it
 
01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to be just in-state
 
01:39:58.910 --> 01:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
utilities but also could be out of state
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
utilities this is important I think
 
01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
particularly in major new energy
 
01:40:06.350 --> 01:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
resources like offshore wind the six New
 
01:40:08.570 --> 01:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
England Governors received a
 
01:40:11.209 --> 01:40:11.219 align:start position:0%
presentation a couple of months ago
 
01:40:14.810 --> 01:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
about the wisdom of entering into
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
multi-state agreements both for power
 
01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
procurement from offshore wind and also
 
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
for the transmission
 
01:40:25.310 --> 01:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
projects to do that as that will
 
01:40:27.470 --> 01:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
probably get the best price and protect
 
01:40:29.930 --> 01:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
the interests of the state's regarding
 
01:40:31.490 --> 01:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
that industry so that's an important
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
addition from the version we first had
 
01:40:35.330 --> 01:40:35.340 align:start position:0%
in the Senate that we could also go
 
01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
without a state the utilities
 
01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
I think aligns 25 to 7 27 this is a an
 
01:40:44.570 --> 01:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
issue of the interconnection costs and
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with that in our
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
discussion of Senate Bill 166 that how
 
01:40:51.770 --> 01:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
we're going to have if new resources are
 
01:40:54.530 --> 01:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
coming online the interconnection costs
 
01:40:57.410 --> 01:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
can be substantial and so we have to
 
01:40:59.689 --> 01:40:59.699 align:start position:0%
account for that here I know there's
 
01:41:01.930 --> 01:41:01.940 align:start position:0%
some anxiety among the community power
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
folks that think that including this
 
01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
here has potentially covered in these uh
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
agreements might in some ways create
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
somewhat unfair competition with
 
01:41:14.450 --> 01:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
projects they want to do but actually I
 
01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
think that this is in accordance with
 
01:41:17.450 --> 01:41:17.460 align:start position:0%
what community power wants to do because
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
we've heard about these interconnection
 
01:41:21.770 --> 01:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
costs and so this would be a way for us
 
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
in these contracts to recognize that
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
that is going to be a cost to make sure
 
01:41:27.649 --> 01:41:27.659 align:start position:0%
that we can get these lower lower costs
 
01:41:29.930 --> 01:41:29.940 align:start position:0%
and more reliable electric supplies to
 
01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
our consumers
 
01:41:34.850 --> 01:41:34.860 align:start position:0%
um the process here I think is really
 
01:41:37.970 --> 01:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
good in terms of ensuring public comment
 
01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
of course when it goes to the puc
 
01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
there's public comment there but prior
 
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
to that please note on lines 28 and 29
 
01:41:49.609 --> 01:41:49.619 align:start position:0%
that we've included that there will be
 
01:41:51.649 --> 01:41:51.659 align:start position:0%
consultation with the Department of
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
energy and then crucially we added in
 
01:41:55.729 --> 01:41:55.739 align:start position:0%
the Senate and the office of the
 
01:41:58.490 --> 01:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate so we'll have the
 
01:42:00.050 --> 01:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
voice of the government and the experts
 
01:42:01.729 --> 01:42:01.739 align:start position:0%
there looking out for the interests of
 
01:42:04.370 --> 01:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
low-cost power for our rate payers and
 
01:42:06.350 --> 01:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
we'll have the voice of the consumer
 
01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
Advocate there to make sure that all
 
01:42:13.310 --> 01:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
voices are heard as well in that process
 
01:42:15.530 --> 01:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
um we've heard before that we probably
 
01:42:17.149 --> 01:42:17.159 align:start position:0%
this has been complicated we need to
 
01:42:18.410 --> 01:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
hire some Consultants that's a
 
01:42:20.450 --> 01:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
recoverable cost so you see that page
 
01:42:24.169 --> 01:42:24.179 align:start position:0%
two in section four there
 
01:42:26.990 --> 01:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
um then we have some guard rails around
 
01:42:30.109 --> 01:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
the uh size of the projects um you'll
 
01:42:31.970 --> 01:42:31.980 align:start position:0%
see lines 12 through
 
01:42:35.450 --> 01:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
16 there defining how much power can
 
01:42:38.030 --> 01:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
come in under these under these uh
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
agreements and then um I think really
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
kind of smart and interesting ways that
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
this came forward working with utilities
 
01:42:48.590 --> 01:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
in doe about new and incremental sources
 
01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
noon incremental sources because it it's
 
01:42:54.050 --> 01:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
not just news sources but it might be
 
01:42:56.109 --> 01:42:56.119 align:start position:0%
incremental that there are
 
01:42:59.570 --> 01:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
power suppliers now who could expand
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
their capacity
 
01:43:03.229 --> 01:43:03.239 align:start position:0%
um I'm really interested in the
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
possibility of current power plants
 
01:43:07.729 --> 01:43:07.739 align:start position:0%
maybe shifting over to hydrogen as you
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
know or a combination of of large
 
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
large-scale solar or other kinds of
 
01:43:14.689 --> 01:43:14.699 align:start position:0%
things too so I think that's important
 
01:43:17.149 --> 01:43:17.159 align:start position:0%
that we're saying look you know all the
 
01:43:19.010 --> 01:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
industry all the suppliers can be
 
01:43:21.050 --> 01:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
players in this and I think that's
 
01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
important so that they can compete they
 
01:43:24.890 --> 01:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
can figure out what kind of projects are
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
going to work for
 
01:43:30.050 --> 01:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
um work for them
 
01:43:32.570 --> 01:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
um and then again some I think really
 
01:43:34.850 --> 01:43:34.860 align:start position:0%
important consumer protections we have
 
01:43:36.770 --> 01:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
added in here several in several places
 
01:43:39.770 --> 01:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we have the just and
 
01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
reasonable language down in on in the
 
01:43:46.490 --> 01:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
public interest on lines 33 to 34 and
 
01:43:48.350 --> 01:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
then continuing on to page three you'll
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
see the correct criteria that are set up
 
01:43:52.490 --> 01:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
here to make sure this isn't the best
 
01:43:55.490 --> 01:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
interest and most costs effective to our
 
01:43:58.609 --> 01:43:58.619 align:start position:0%
rate payer so on page three line three
 
01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
cost effective to Electric grade payers
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
now personally I think that means that
 
01:44:06.649 --> 01:44:06.659 align:start position:0%
what's going to be most cost effective
 
01:44:08.450 --> 01:44:08.460 align:start position:0%
in these sources coming down the road
 
01:44:10.490 --> 01:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
well I think we're seeing in the
 
01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
marketplace right now it's going to be a
 
01:44:13.729 --> 01:44:13.739 align:start position:0%
lot of renewable sources but it might
 
01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
not exclusively be them
 
01:44:17.570 --> 01:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
this this uh understanding lines five or
 
01:44:23.330 --> 01:44:23.340 align:start position:0%
six that you know we are hammered
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
because of the winter right and having
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
to go out in the spot Market to get gas
 
01:44:29.149 --> 01:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
when it's very high and the issue is
 
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
about LNG going to Europe instead of
 
01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
coming here and you know the reliability
 
01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
of wind of solar wind is strong in the
 
01:44:39.109 --> 01:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
wind but solar not in the winter
 
01:44:40.910 --> 01:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
this wind is stronger in the winter
 
01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
solar weaker vice versa in the summer
 
01:44:46.189 --> 01:44:46.199 align:start position:0%
but reliability there I think what's
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
important too on five and six is that
 
01:44:51.770 --> 01:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
um we have a potential for storage and
 
01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
we've passed some good laws to make sure
 
01:44:56.450 --> 01:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
that storage can be in this um mix in
 
01:44:59.149 --> 01:44:59.159 align:start position:0%
terms of long duration winter cold
 
01:45:01.729 --> 01:45:01.739 align:start position:0%
events diversification of New Hampshire
 
01:45:04.669 --> 01:45:04.679 align:start position:0%
electric energy sources I think that's
 
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
just key we all know that we got over
 
01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
reliant on on gas and and Seabrook uh
 
01:45:11.689 --> 01:45:11.699 align:start position:0%
you know good thank goodness for
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
Seabrook and you know over the years but
 
01:45:15.290 --> 01:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
something you know if there was a if
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
there's a problem there or if we see a
 
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
spike in um what we've seen in the
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
natural gas then it we have
 
01:45:24.590 --> 01:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
diversification is going to is going to
 
01:45:26.689 --> 01:45:26.699 align:start position:0%
help us and this bill can help with that
 
01:45:30.370 --> 01:45:30.380 align:start position:0%
then I think importantly too in line 14
 
01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
we added minimized costs and maximized
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
benefits to rate Pairs and I just think
 
01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:38.390 align:start position:0%
in this bill
for

01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:45:40.250 --> 01:45:40.260 align:start position:0%
um you know for all of us and both on
 
01:45:42.410 --> 01:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
all sides of the power uh issues and
 
01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
energy issues are renewable or not
 
01:45:45.950 --> 01:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
renewable that that's something I think
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
we all can agree on that this is our
 
01:45:50.689 --> 01:45:50.699 align:start position:0%
purpose minimize costs maximize benefits
 
01:45:52.729 --> 01:45:52.739 align:start position:0%
to rate payers and my reading of this
 
01:45:54.649 --> 01:45:54.659 align:start position:0%
bill is that that phrase really backs up
 
01:45:56.030 --> 01:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
through the whole bill
 
01:45:58.010 --> 01:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
because if at the point of sailing is
 
01:46:00.350 --> 01:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
selling this power that's what governs
 
01:46:02.209 --> 01:46:02.219 align:start position:0%
it then you better be sure you developed
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
resources all the way through this that
 
01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
make a nice cost and maximize benefits
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
and then at the end
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
um we have to recognize the uh the the
 
01:46:15.490 --> 01:46:15.500 align:start position:0%
co-ops that aren't regulated utilities
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
who are already doing some of this and
 
01:46:20.510 --> 01:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
we're saying you can do you know go keep
 
01:46:23.450 --> 01:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
keep as you were that you can do what
 
01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
you do uh and um you know how to do it
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chairman
 
01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:29.090 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chairman
foreign

01:46:29.090 --> 01:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:46:30.770 --> 01:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator appreciate you
 
01:46:32.450 --> 01:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill that was a
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
comprehensive explanation of how it all
 
01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:35.450 align:start position:0%
comprehensive explanation of how it all
works

01:46:35.450 --> 01:46:35.460 align:start position:0%
works
 
01:46:37.250 --> 01:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure that the committee will
 
01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
have a few questions for you and I'm
 
01:46:40.270 --> 01:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
going to start by asking a question
 
01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
about the provision that you discussed
 
01:46:47.450 --> 01:46:47.460 align:start position:0%
on page one that allows New Hampshire
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
utilities to partner with out-of-state
 
01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:01.129 --> 01:47:01.139 align:start position:0%
that does sound on the one hand to be
 
01:47:03.410 --> 01:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
like an attractive feature of this
 
01:47:03.420 --> 01:47:05.510 align:start position:0%
like an attractive feature of this
legislation

01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:47:08.330 --> 01:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
but what concerns me and what I'd like
 
01:47:12.590 --> 01:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
to hear an explanation about is that
 
01:47:16.910 --> 01:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
on page three of the bill lines
 
01:47:22.189 --> 01:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
basically 15 through 19 allows
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
the utilities to credit or charge all
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
distribution rate payers the difference
 
01:47:29.629 --> 01:47:29.639 align:start position:0%
between the agreement payments and
 
01:47:31.970 --> 01:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
proceeds through a uniform fully
 
01:47:36.890 --> 01:47:36.900 align:start position:0%
recounseling annual factor in rates
 
01:47:38.930 --> 01:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
if you combine those two things together
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
a PPA that
 
01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
has New Hampshire utilities but out of
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
state utilities as well
 
01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
and this language about charging
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
distribution rate pairs
 
01:47:52.729 --> 01:47:52.739 align:start position:0%
does that expose New Hampshire rate
 
01:47:54.370 --> 01:47:54.380 align:start position:0%
payers to being
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
charged rates or or costs that
 
01:48:01.490 --> 01:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
are not incurred in New Hampshire but
 
01:48:04.090 --> 01:48:04.100 align:start position:0%
are incurred outside of New Hampshire
 
01:48:07.070 --> 01:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question Mr chairman and
 
01:48:09.770 --> 01:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
um my feeling on this one and I think
 
01:48:11.689 --> 01:48:11.699 align:start position:0%
there are folks from doe and elsewhere
 
01:48:14.629 --> 01:48:14.639 align:start position:0%
you can ask after me is that this is
 
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
exactly what would have to be worked out
 
01:48:18.890 --> 01:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
and that apportionment of costs in the
 
01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:20.209 align:start position:0%
and that apportionment of costs in the
PPA

01:48:20.209 --> 01:48:20.219 align:start position:0%
PPA
 
01:48:23.870 --> 01:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
as it goes to the puc because
 
01:48:26.810 --> 01:48:26.820 align:start position:0%
cost effective New Hampshire rate payers
 
01:48:29.330 --> 01:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
so that that's where I think that'd be a
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
portion out if you think there needs to
 
01:48:33.709 --> 01:48:33.719 align:start position:0%
be some clarification of that point in
 
01:48:35.330 --> 01:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
those lines on page
 
01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
um three through working with the doe I
 
01:48:39.770 --> 01:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
think that would be you know belt and
 
01:48:41.629 --> 01:48:41.639 align:start position:0%
suspenders there but that's that's my
 
01:48:43.729 --> 01:48:43.739 align:start position:0%
understanding of that that issue and I
 
01:48:45.229 --> 01:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
will say that I've seen this already
 
01:48:48.350 --> 01:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
down in the mid Coast Area in New York
 
01:48:50.090 --> 01:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
and Connecticut and Rhode Island that
 
01:48:52.330 --> 01:48:52.340 align:start position:0%
they are able to leverage much better
 
01:48:55.490 --> 01:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
long-term power purchase agreements
 
01:48:58.250 --> 01:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
um the larger they are and to get we're
 
01:48:59.750 --> 01:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to get maybe large
 
01:49:01.970 --> 01:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
enough but with our with other states we
 
01:49:04.970 --> 01:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
could I do also think though that most
 
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
of these proposals are not going to
 
01:49:08.330 --> 01:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
include the out-of-staters but that
 
01:49:10.430 --> 01:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
option should be there
 
01:49:12.669 --> 01:49:12.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that explanation
 
01:49:14.510 --> 01:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:49:16.910 --> 01:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has one thank
 
01:49:18.350 --> 01:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you senator for
 
01:49:19.970 --> 01:49:19.980 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:49:21.530 --> 01:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to look at this and
 
01:49:22.970 --> 01:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
there's all these good words in here
 
01:49:25.010 --> 01:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
about how cost Effectiveness and we're
 
01:49:26.270 --> 01:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
going to do this and everyone's going to
 
01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
review it and everybody's going to check
 
01:49:29.570 --> 01:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
it out but you know the same thing was
 
01:49:31.970 --> 01:49:31.980 align:start position:0%
done for Seabrook and that put Public
 
01:49:33.470 --> 01:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
Service Company in New Hampshire into
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy and for years and years and
 
01:49:37.729 --> 01:49:37.739 align:start position:0%
years people were paying stranded costs
 
01:49:39.590 --> 01:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
on their electric bill it was the same
 
01:49:40.850 --> 01:49:40.860 align:start position:0%
thing that was done for the Burgess
 
01:49:43.729 --> 01:49:43.739 align:start position:0%
biomass plant we even had a safety valve
 
01:49:45.590 --> 01:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
in there if you will that said if the
 
01:49:48.109 --> 01:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
prices are way off Market rates then the
 
01:49:49.850 --> 01:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
rate payers will be reimbursed but now
 
01:49:51.890 --> 01:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
we're told by the company that
 
01:49:53.570 --> 01:49:53.580 align:start position:0%
they don't have any money and if they
 
01:49:55.250 --> 01:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
try to enforce that Clause they'll go
 
01:49:57.590 --> 01:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
bankrupt so why is this any different
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
why now are we going to be so much
 
01:50:02.030 --> 01:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
smarter looking into the future for 20
 
01:50:04.250 --> 01:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
years and say boy we really know what's
 
01:50:05.810 --> 01:50:05.820 align:start position:0%
going to be the electric prices in 20
 
01:50:07.310 --> 01:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
years so we're going to sign these
 
01:50:09.050 --> 01:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
long-term contracts for the benefit of
 
01:50:10.729 --> 01:50:10.739 align:start position:0%
everybody when in fact the only thing we
 
01:50:12.590 --> 01:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
know about future electric prices is we
 
01:50:13.790 --> 01:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
know nothing about future electric
 
01:50:16.970 --> 01:50:16.980 align:start position:0%
prices so why is it different now yeah
 
01:50:18.350 --> 01:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question uh
 
01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative and I too have been
 
01:50:20.870 --> 01:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
around New Hampshire the longest
 
01:50:22.810 --> 01:50:22.820 align:start position:0%
remember no quip remember
 
01:50:26.570 --> 01:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
and uh and um you know I I was thinking
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
of Ronald Reagan you know um trust but
 
01:50:31.129 --> 01:50:31.139 align:start position:0%
verify and a lot of the language of cost
 
01:50:33.410 --> 01:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness that is now in statute
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
otherwise and in this bill I think it
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
was a result of those earlier failures
 
01:50:41.689 --> 01:50:41.699 align:start position:0%
because we didn't have that as a rock
 
01:50:44.689 --> 01:50:44.699 align:start position:0%
solid principle in our protection and
 
01:50:46.729 --> 01:50:46.739 align:start position:0%
charade pairs the language is here
 
01:50:49.370 --> 01:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
that's why it's in the bill and I think
 
01:50:51.590 --> 01:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
it sends a very clear message to the puc
 
01:50:54.109 --> 01:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
and to the utilities and that that that
 
01:50:57.229 --> 01:50:57.239 align:start position:0%
that's what we expect in his contract
 
01:51:00.770 --> 01:51:00.780 align:start position:0%
um now can mistakes be made or you know
 
01:51:02.930 --> 01:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
uh I mean that's why we're here isn't it
 
01:51:04.970 --> 01:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
I mean we set the policy if we see
 
01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
something going off off the rails then
 
01:51:10.490 --> 01:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
we can we can intervene but I I hear
 
01:51:12.109 --> 01:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're saying and I think
 
01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's why we have to make sure this is
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
this is just what that we that we think
 
01:51:18.169 --> 01:51:18.179 align:start position:0%
it can work
 
01:51:21.290 --> 01:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you yeah that's fine I'm
 
01:51:22.729 --> 01:51:22.739 align:start position:0%
not going to debate obviously here but I
 
01:51:24.830 --> 01:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
do have another question on the uh page
 
01:51:28.129 --> 01:51:28.139 align:start position:0%
3 18 when it talks about uh all
 
01:51:31.609 --> 01:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
distribution rate payers so if I choose
 
01:51:33.169 --> 01:51:33.179 align:start position:0%
to go with a competitive supplier and
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
buy my electricity from them in this
 
01:51:38.570 --> 01:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
term becomes effective I would have to
 
01:51:41.090 --> 01:51:41.100 align:start position:0%
pay extra for this contract that I'm not
 
01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719 align:start position:0%
buying any electricity from is that
 
01:51:42.719 --> 01:51:44.629 align:start position:0%
buying any electricity from is that
correct

01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
I I'm sorry so I'm I buy it from a
 
01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
competitive supplier let's say so I'm
 
01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
not buying from the utility I don't
 
01:51:52.669 --> 01:51:52.679 align:start position:0%
assume I don't think you'd be affected
 
01:51:54.530 --> 01:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
by this at all but then I'm a
 
01:51:57.229 --> 01:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
distribution rate pay so I have to well
 
01:51:59.149 --> 01:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
I don't know I charge or credit the
 
01:52:01.070 --> 01:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
difference so I would have to be charged
 
01:52:02.990 --> 01:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I know exactly the answer
 
01:52:05.689 --> 01:52:05.699 align:start position:0%
to that that question so okay that's for
 
01:52:08.510 --> 01:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
um for subsequent testimony yeah we
 
01:52:11.870 --> 01:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:13.970 --> 01:52:13.980 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Senator
 
01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh my concern was
 
01:52:21.169 --> 01:52:21.179 align:start position:0%
mostly first I'm going to fall off of
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
Representative harrigan's question about
 
01:52:25.550 --> 01:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
the uh actually with opening in
 
01:52:28.010 --> 01:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
contracts for not only not for the
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
ratepayers it actually looks good for
 
01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
the rate payers but for generators and
 
01:52:34.070 --> 01:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
bird just comes to mind as hearing as
 
01:52:35.930 --> 01:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
representative Herring brought up
 
01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
um is there will this eliminate the risk
 
01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
of generate power generators being
 
01:52:43.310 --> 01:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
locked into a contract that's infeasible
 
01:52:45.050 --> 01:52:45.060 align:start position:0%
for them
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
well that's the question and you know I
 
01:52:52.850 --> 01:52:52.860 align:start position:0%
I think this is you know it's it's hard
 
01:52:54.649 --> 01:52:54.659 align:start position:0%
it's hard to know you know isn't it
 
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
about what is what the future will hold
 
01:52:59.810 --> 01:52:59.820 align:start position:0%
I think the wisdom in this bill is to
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
not is to get us out of the lock box of
 
01:53:05.330 --> 01:53:05.340 align:start position:0%
the six months going into the market
 
01:53:07.370 --> 01:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
and that you know you look at layered
 
01:53:10.129 --> 01:53:10.139 align:start position:0%
contracts I mean you know how is risk
 
01:53:10.139 --> 01:53:11.629 align:start position:0%
contracts I mean you know how is risk
allocated

01:53:11.629 --> 01:53:11.639 align:start position:0%
allocated
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
or avoided right it's it's through the
 
01:53:17.330 --> 01:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
capacity to have different layering and
 
01:53:19.790 --> 01:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
different terms of links of contracts so
 
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
I think that's what this what it makes
 
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
possible but that's why the word may is
 
01:53:25.330 --> 01:53:25.340 align:start position:0%
so important
 
01:53:28.250 --> 01:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
and then all that we've got around this
 
01:53:30.229 --> 01:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
with the doe the consumer Advocate and
 
01:53:31.609 --> 01:53:31.619 align:start position:0%
the puc
 
01:53:33.410 --> 01:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we aren't you know
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
stuck kind of holding the bag so thank
 
01:53:39.169 --> 01:53:39.179 align:start position:0%
you follow follow up and then a quick
 
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up you hit there a little bit on
 
01:53:42.530 --> 01:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
the six months would this if this bill
 
01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
passed would it allow the the uh to be
 
01:53:48.169 --> 01:53:48.179 align:start position:0%
able to bypass the puc for the utilities
 
01:53:50.450 --> 01:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
to be able to go to the market more
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
often once every six months
 
01:53:54.649 --> 01:53:54.659 align:start position:0%
well thanks for the question um you
 
01:53:56.450 --> 01:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
can't bypass the puc of this bill what
 
01:53:58.310 --> 01:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
it says is that they can bring to the
 
01:54:02.330 --> 01:54:02.340 align:start position:0%
puc contracts that are longer
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
if they fulfill the criteria of this
 
01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:08.629 align:start position:0%
if they fulfill the criteria of this
bill

01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative
 
01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
Reynolds has one thank you Mr chairman
 
01:54:15.709 --> 01:54:15.719 align:start position:0%
um referring back to representative
 
01:54:18.169 --> 01:54:18.179 align:start position:0%
Harrington's question and I think also
 
01:54:20.689 --> 01:54:20.699 align:start position:0%
to representative Summers question uh
 
01:54:23.689 --> 01:54:23.699 align:start position:0%
you indicated that this bill uh
 
01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
originally in the Senate was uh specific
 
01:54:30.890 --> 01:54:30.900 align:start position:0%
to renewable new renewable generation
 
01:54:33.109 --> 01:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
and of course it was amended as you
 
01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
pointed out to be fuel neutral but isn't
 
01:54:39.370 --> 01:54:39.380 align:start position:0%
isn't what's different in what is
 
01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
contemplated by this bill that the peop
 
01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:45.370 align:start position:0%
that such ppas would
 
01:54:45.370 --> 01:54:47.330 align:start position:0%
that such ppas would
[Music]

01:54:47.330 --> 01:54:47.340 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:54:49.490 --> 01:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
May well be with
 
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
renewable new sources of generation you
 
01:54:55.070 --> 01:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
know they must be
 
01:54:59.149 --> 01:54:59.159 align:start position:0%
new sources after 2023 whose fuel costs
 
01:55:06.530 --> 01:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:06.540 --> 01:55:07.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:09.169 --> 01:55:09.179 align:start position:0%
so that's the question
 
01:55:09.179 --> 01:55:10.910 align:start position:0%
so that's the question
um

01:55:10.910 --> 01:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:12.410 --> 01:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
you know you have to pay for the
 
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
generating capacity uh even whether the
 
01:55:18.410 --> 01:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
fuel sources are but um you know I I
 
01:55:20.750 --> 01:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
think it's probably most be best for the
 
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
utilities that you really talk about
 
01:55:25.970 --> 01:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
what they see in these and um in terms
 
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
of the the way the bill came through I
 
01:55:30.890 --> 01:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
mean I think that Senator evarts started
 
01:55:32.629 --> 01:55:32.639 align:start position:0%
out thinking that the these are the
 
01:55:34.970 --> 01:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
these are the the best way to diversify
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
is to focus on those Renewables and it
 
01:55:40.129 --> 01:55:40.139 align:start position:0%
also convinced that the cost is probably
 
01:55:41.570 --> 01:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
going to be the last but I think the
 
01:55:44.209 --> 01:55:44.219 align:start position:0%
wisdom of moving the direction we did to
 
01:55:46.370 --> 01:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
not preempt that but to say under new
 
01:55:48.109 --> 01:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
and incremental that there are
 
01:55:51.169 --> 01:55:51.179 align:start position:0%
possibilities for providing
 
01:55:53.870 --> 01:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
um reliable and cost-effective power
 
01:55:57.050 --> 01:55:57.060 align:start position:0%
supplies and that's what that's what the
 
01:56:01.010 --> 01:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
market will will will teach us um but
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
I'm you know Mr chairman it is getting
 
01:56:05.930 --> 01:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
warm and the ice is getting thin and I
 
01:56:08.350 --> 01:56:08.360 align:start position:0%
think I'm skating on it and uh
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
glad to be here for Senator avard but um
 
01:56:12.530 --> 01:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
you know I really think there's a lot of
 
01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
these questions or you're going to get a
 
01:56:16.189 --> 01:56:16.199 align:start position:0%
much much better answers from the folks
 
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
after me
 
01:56:19.790 --> 01:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator I was actually going
 
01:56:21.290 --> 01:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
to suggest to the members of the
 
01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
committee that since we have 10 more
 
01:56:25.310 --> 01:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
people who want to speak on this bill
 
01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
and it's 11 o'clock already that it
 
01:56:30.709 --> 01:56:30.719 align:start position:0%
might be advisable to move on so I
 
01:56:33.169 --> 01:56:33.179 align:start position:0%
appreciate your comments and uh thank
 
01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
you for introducing the bill next we'll
 
01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
hear from
 
01:56:39.590 --> 01:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner Chris Elms and Dan
 
01:56:41.930 --> 01:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
Phelan from the New Hampshire Department
 
01:56:44.149 --> 01:56:44.159 align:start position:0%
of energy to get their take on this
 
01:56:44.159 --> 01:56:45.649 align:start position:0%
of energy to get their take on this
legislation

01:56:45.649 --> 01:56:45.659 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:56:52.070 --> 01:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:53.810 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:56:53.810 --> 01:56:53.820 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:56:57.229 --> 01:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
01:56:58.669 --> 01:56:58.679 align:start position:0%
Chris Elms I'm the Deputy Commissioner
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:57:02.030 --> 01:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
energy and I'm joined by Dan Phelan who
 
01:57:04.070 --> 01:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
manages Regional electric issues for the
 
01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:05.750 align:start position:0%
manages Regional electric issues for the
Department

01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
Department
 
01:57:08.450 --> 01:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
we are here today in support of Senate
 
01:57:10.910 --> 01:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 54 which we have worked on with
 
01:57:13.129 --> 01:57:13.139 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and legislators through the
 
01:57:16.250 --> 01:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
process the bill has a clear mission
 
01:57:18.589 --> 01:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
to incentivize new resources in a
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
technology-neutral way
 
01:57:22.609 --> 01:57:22.619 align:start position:0%
and to help address our winter
 
01:57:25.010 --> 01:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
reliability problems our price
 
01:57:27.229 --> 01:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
volatility problems and just the overall
 
01:57:30.290 --> 01:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
cost of electricity in New Hampshire
 
01:57:32.209 --> 01:57:32.219 align:start position:0%
um just to be upfront about it uh this
 
01:57:34.129 --> 01:57:34.139 align:start position:0%
bill represents a significant compromise
 
01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
from the Department of energy and and
 
01:57:38.209 --> 01:57:38.219 align:start position:0%
where our positioning has been uh the
 
01:57:41.870 --> 01:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
bill has introduced uh was not a bill
 
01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
that we were able to support
 
01:57:47.450 --> 01:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
um but but in working with folks
 
01:57:49.790 --> 01:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
um we were able to get to what we have
 
01:57:51.950 --> 01:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
before us today uh just to give you a
 
01:57:53.930 --> 01:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
background on this uh the department and
 
01:57:55.790 --> 01:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
and previously before the department puc
 
01:57:58.070 --> 01:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
staff have historically been opposed to
 
01:58:00.709 --> 01:58:00.719 align:start position:0%
power purchase agreements we are a
 
01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
market oriented team we love markets and
 
01:58:04.729 --> 01:58:04.739 align:start position:0%
the competitive outcomes that they
 
01:58:06.589 --> 01:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
provide and
 
01:58:08.149 --> 01:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
um you know we believe that other
 
01:58:09.890 --> 01:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
government interventions you know have
 
01:58:13.070 --> 01:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
contributed to two challenges
 
01:58:14.570 --> 01:58:14.580 align:start position:0%
um so really the question is why are we
 
01:58:15.770 --> 01:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill
 
01:58:17.930 --> 01:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
you know we as we all know we are living
 
01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
in extraordinary times in the field of
 
01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:20.750 align:start position:0%
in extraordinary times in the field of
energy

01:58:20.750 --> 01:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:58:23.209 --> 01:58:23.219 align:start position:0%
um you know what we've seen uh with
 
01:58:25.790 --> 01:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
natural gas has been historic
 
01:58:27.169 --> 01:58:27.179 align:start position:0%
um there are combination of factors that
 
01:58:28.669 --> 01:58:28.679 align:start position:0%
have made this kind of a perfect storm
 
01:58:30.649 --> 01:58:30.659 align:start position:0%
but what we've seen is that look natural
 
01:58:32.870 --> 01:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
gas is a global commodity that has
 
01:58:34.490 --> 01:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
experienced extreme price volatility
 
01:58:36.350 --> 01:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
which means our wholesale Market
 
01:58:39.530 --> 01:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
electric markets are experiencing you
 
01:58:40.970 --> 01:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
know that extreme volatility which means
 
01:58:42.290 --> 01:58:42.300 align:start position:0%
our residential rate payers are going to
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
be also
 
01:58:45.950 --> 01:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
experiencing that volatility
 
01:58:47.330 --> 01:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
um but bringing it down to the regional
 
01:58:49.729 --> 01:58:49.739 align:start position:0%
level our grid is built on natural gas
 
01:58:51.950 --> 01:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
and we don't have the natural gas
 
01:58:54.709 --> 01:58:54.719 align:start position:0%
infrastructure uh you know to meet our
 
01:58:57.290 --> 01:58:57.300 align:start position:0%
needs we have a real difficulty in
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
working to get more and what that means
 
01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
is we have a winter reliability
 
01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:01.430 align:start position:0%
is we have a winter reliability
challenge

01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:02.870 align:start position:0%
challenge
uh

01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:59:04.609 --> 01:59:04.619 align:start position:0%
you know we were honestly really lucky
 
01:59:06.589 --> 01:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
this winter to have had a mild winter
 
01:59:09.649 --> 01:59:09.659 align:start position:0%
and we're able to keep the lights on if
 
01:59:11.330 --> 01:59:11.340 align:start position:0%
we end up with long periods of extreme
 
01:59:13.550 --> 01:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
cold this region will see capacity
 
01:59:15.709 --> 01:59:15.719 align:start position:0%
shortfalls and that means greater risks
 
01:59:17.930 --> 01:59:17.940 align:start position:0%
for our rate payers and for our citizens
 
01:59:19.729 --> 01:59:19.739 align:start position:0%
at the worst possible times
 
01:59:21.530 --> 01:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
and frankly
 
01:59:23.270 --> 01:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
given the challenges that we've seen in
 
01:59:24.950 --> 01:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
the market and the need to bring in
 
01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
resources to address them it's clear
 
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
that there's a desire you know to
 
01:59:31.609 --> 01:59:31.619 align:start position:0%
incentivize uh building new electrons
 
01:59:34.250 --> 01:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
bringing new electrons into New England
 
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
um so in light of these considerations
 
01:59:37.609 --> 01:59:37.619 align:start position:0%
and the desire from policy makers
 
01:59:39.950 --> 01:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
legislators to move forward with
 
01:59:41.390 --> 01:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
legislation to try and address these
 
01:59:44.030 --> 01:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
challenges we have put together this PPA
 
01:59:46.850 --> 01:59:46.860 align:start position:0%
proposal that is laser focused on on
 
01:59:48.830 --> 01:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
three things and three things only and
 
01:59:50.810 --> 01:59:50.820 align:start position:0%
that's price stability that's price
 
01:59:53.209 --> 01:59:53.219 align:start position:0%
volatility or you know price volatility
 
01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
with with stability the overall cost and
 
01:59:58.030 --> 01:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
that winter reliability challenge
 
02:00:01.310 --> 02:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
this bill must be technology neutral as
 
02:00:02.810 --> 02:00:02.820 align:start position:0%
we see it this bill cannot be about
 
02:00:05.209 --> 02:00:05.219 align:start position:0%
giving every technology type their their
 
02:00:07.550 --> 02:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
their slice of the pie we're achieving
 
02:00:08.810 --> 02:00:08.820 align:start position:0%
you know other goals that are not
 
02:00:11.930 --> 02:00:11.940 align:start position:0%
related to price or reliability you know
 
02:00:13.310 --> 02:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
for the Department to be supportive of
 
02:00:15.050 --> 02:00:15.060 align:start position:0%
this bill it can be the only mission of
 
02:00:16.189 --> 02:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
the legislation
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh we would oppose any expansion Beyond
 
02:00:20.149 --> 02:00:20.159 align:start position:0%
where it is now
 
02:00:21.530 --> 02:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
um you know you might hear from folks
 
02:00:23.089 --> 02:00:23.099 align:start position:0%
who have a difference of opinion there
 
02:00:25.010 --> 02:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
is no perfect solution to this to this
 
02:00:26.810 --> 02:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
problem but we do need to do something
 
02:00:30.050 --> 02:00:30.060 align:start position:0%
and and there are not many achievable uh
 
02:00:31.609 --> 02:00:31.619 align:start position:0%
suggestions about how we'll be able to
 
02:00:35.050 --> 02:00:35.060 align:start position:0%
deliver reliable and uh you know
 
02:00:38.270 --> 02:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
cost-effective resources to the region
 
02:00:40.129 --> 02:00:40.139 align:start position:0%
um Senator Waters did a fabulous job of
 
02:00:42.109 --> 02:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
running through the bill I think Dan's
 
02:00:44.450 --> 02:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
going to hit some points of of just you
 
02:00:45.890 --> 02:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
know what the bill looks like and sort
 
02:00:48.530 --> 02:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
of why we wanted to put those guardrails
 
02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:50.270 align:start position:0%
of why we wanted to put those guardrails
on

02:00:50.270 --> 02:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:00:52.370 --> 02:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
yep that's right uh Senator Waters did a
 
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
really admirable job of walking you all
 
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
through the bill so I hope that there's
 
02:00:58.430 --> 02:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
Clarity in what is in the bill and sort
 
02:01:01.490 --> 02:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
of how it accomplishes the agreements uh
 
02:01:05.330 --> 02:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
themselves I did want to raise a few
 
02:01:07.790 --> 02:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
things that are important to us and uh
 
02:01:10.910 --> 02:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner Helms also talked about the
 
02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
winter reliability the price stability
 
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
and the price overall effects those are
 
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
our priorities
 
02:01:22.790 --> 02:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
I also wanted to raise that this bill in
 
02:01:26.209 --> 02:01:26.219 align:start position:0%
uh page one section 18 or line 18
 
02:01:29.390 --> 02:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
through 20 includes or does not include
 
02:01:32.450 --> 02:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
to the decision of the utility the
 
02:01:34.609 --> 02:01:34.619 align:start position:0%
environmental attributes of any resource
 
02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
that would be part of this agreement
 
02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:39.370 align:start position:0%
that would be part of this agreement
um

02:01:39.370 --> 02:01:39.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:44.719 align:start position:0%
a another area that was left out is that
 
02:01:48.890 --> 02:01:48.900 align:start position:0%
again mentioned 11 through 13 on page
 
02:01:52.490 --> 02:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
three but I've skipped here uh so on
 
02:01:56.209 --> 02:01:56.219 align:start position:0%
page two lines 12 through 16 this sets
 
02:01:57.770 --> 02:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
out the size of the agreement and that
 
02:02:00.530 --> 02:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
is 2 million megawatt hours that
 
02:02:03.229 --> 02:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
accounts for roughly 20 percent of New
 
02:02:07.609 --> 02:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's load and that number is uh
 
02:02:12.050 --> 02:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
sizable enough to incent the right sorts
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
of resources that could provide winter
 
02:02:16.609 --> 02:02:16.619 align:start position:0%
security but also small enough that we
 
02:02:18.830 --> 02:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
are not completely giving up on the
 
02:02:21.890 --> 02:02:21.900 align:start position:0%
managing markets in New England there
 
02:02:24.050 --> 02:02:24.060 align:start position:0%
there's a idea that we want to have skin
 
02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
in the game here and we want to show
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
that we're serious about meeting these
 
02:02:30.530 --> 02:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
winter reliability problems and that 20
 
02:02:33.950 --> 02:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
percent of load is what we think is is
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
the right balance for for that figure
 
02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:39.649 align:start position:0%
the right balance for for that figure
um

02:02:39.649 --> 02:02:39.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:42.169 --> 02:02:42.179 align:start position:0%
another issue that was not raised is the
 
02:02:45.050 --> 02:02:45.060 align:start position:0%
the timeline associated with this bill
 
02:02:48.770 --> 02:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
and that is uh important to us because
 
02:02:51.290 --> 02:02:51.300 align:start position:0%
there's a more immediate need here I
 
02:02:54.530 --> 02:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
think we all know that this winter was
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
was uh eye-opening and we want to really
 
02:03:00.290 --> 02:03:00.300 align:start position:0%
strike before the the
 
02:03:03.530 --> 02:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
situation cools down so the RFP deadline
 
02:03:07.310 --> 02:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
is in 2025 with nine months to review
 
02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
after that and really getting something
 
02:03:13.209 --> 02:03:13.219 align:start position:0%
done and getting things moving before
 
02:03:15.470 --> 02:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
where we're exposed to too many more
 
02:03:18.169 --> 02:03:18.179 align:start position:0%
winters like this is is very important
 
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:25.149 --> 02:03:25.159 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
conditions under which the agreement can
 
02:03:31.490 --> 02:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
be approved are also important we've
 
02:03:34.729 --> 02:03:34.739 align:start position:0%
talked about cost Effectiveness and I
 
02:03:37.490 --> 02:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
really want to talk about the kinds the
 
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
the so page three line five uh electric
 
02:03:43.070 --> 02:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
energy sources that are expected to be
 
02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
available during long duration winter
 
02:03:49.010 --> 02:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
events New England has a imported fuels
 
02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
problem in that it can only get so much
 
02:03:55.490 --> 02:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
particularly natural gas during long
 
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
duration winter events and it relies on
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
oil during those time periods which sees
 
02:04:04.609 --> 02:04:04.619 align:start position:0%
an inventory that depletes rapidly so
 
02:04:07.310 --> 02:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
the objective here is for something that
 
02:04:10.370 --> 02:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
can displace that oil and natural gas
 
02:04:16.850 --> 02:04:16.860 align:start position:0%
use over a week-long sort of cold event
 
02:04:16.860 --> 02:04:18.709 align:start position:0%
use over a week-long sort of cold event
um

02:04:18.709 --> 02:04:18.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:21.470 --> 02:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
and the final thing that I did want to
 
02:04:26.689 --> 02:04:26.699 align:start position:0%
raise was uh line 16 through 19 on page
 
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
three which is uh the referenced by
 
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington uh the cost
 
02:04:36.950 --> 02:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
recovery mechanism where we do in fact
 
02:04:39.950 --> 02:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
intend for this to be a non-bypassable
 
02:04:43.370 --> 02:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
charge we we see this as a policy choice
 
02:04:47.209 --> 02:04:47.219 align:start position:0%
that is being made on behalf of all New
 
02:04:49.310 --> 02:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens it's something that
 
02:04:50.810 --> 02:04:50.820 align:start position:0%
will provide
 
02:04:54.050 --> 02:04:54.060 align:start position:0%
price uh it'll provide price suppression
 
02:04:58.550 --> 02:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
through the contract and all New
 
02:05:00.550 --> 02:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rate payers will benefit from
 
02:05:03.470 --> 02:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh the increased reliability of the
 
02:05:05.810 --> 02:05:05.820 align:start position:0%
Electric System as a whole
 
02:05:07.310 --> 02:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
um so those were the points that I
 
02:05:10.370 --> 02:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise uh oh and one more is an
 
02:05:13.370 --> 02:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
important distinction which is that we
 
02:05:17.330 --> 02:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
see this as a bill for new electrons not
 
02:05:20.689 --> 02:05:20.699 align:start position:0%
for bailing out resources that may be
 
02:05:24.109 --> 02:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
passed their Prime so we want to prove
 
02:05:26.990 --> 02:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is part of the the
 
02:05:29.629 --> 02:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
region that can actually build that's
 
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
something that we in New England have
 
02:05:34.010 --> 02:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
had a have had a problem with no matter
 
02:05:36.290 --> 02:05:36.300 align:start position:0%
what kind of resource you want to build
 
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
it runs into problems with permitting
 
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
and local opposition and all sorts of
 
02:05:45.649 --> 02:05:45.659 align:start position:0%
different difficulties we want to prove
 
02:05:47.209 --> 02:05:47.219 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is part of the the
 
02:05:49.310 --> 02:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
team that can build resources in New
 
02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:50.390 align:start position:0%
team that can build resources in New
England

02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
England
 
02:05:52.370 --> 02:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
and I'll take questions if you in the
 
02:05:54.169 --> 02:05:54.179 align:start position:0%
community ask them okay questions from
 
02:05:55.850 --> 02:05:55.860 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm sure we'll have quite
 
02:05:57.470 --> 02:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
a few I'm going to start with one myself
 
02:06:01.250 --> 02:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
and ask you that your reference to
 
02:06:03.530 --> 02:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
20 percent of New Hampshire load the 2
 
02:06:06.350 --> 02:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
million megawatt hour limit
 
02:06:11.270 --> 02:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
would you characterize that as a
 
02:06:15.109 --> 02:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
a hedge that utilities would use to try
 
02:06:17.629 --> 02:06:17.639 align:start position:0%
to even out the volatility of
 
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
electricity prices
 
02:06:21.890 --> 02:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
sure I think that's absolutely Fair
 
02:06:24.709 --> 02:06:24.719 align:start position:0%
um so the the agreement will stabilize
 
02:06:27.350 --> 02:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
prices for that portion of the load and
 
02:06:29.930 --> 02:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
you can think of this as a hedge any
 
02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
sort of Premium where if the cost is
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
above market value is essentially the
 
02:06:37.250 --> 02:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:39.290 --> 02:06:39.300 align:start position:0%
okay thank you additional questions from
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
the committee representative Harrington
 
02:06:41.930 --> 02:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
has one
 
02:06:43.550 --> 02:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and thank you for taking my
 
02:06:43.560 --> 02:06:44.330 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and thank you for taking my
question

02:06:44.330 --> 02:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:06:46.010 --> 02:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned to follow up on the
 
02:06:49.850 --> 02:06:49.860 align:start position:0%
Chairman's question 20 of the load uh my
 
02:06:52.070 --> 02:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
first question would be when these are
 
02:06:54.050 --> 02:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
20-year contracts are we looking at the
 
02:06:56.149 --> 02:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
load as it's going to be at the time of
 
02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
the contract issuance or the expected
 
02:07:00.290 --> 02:07:00.300 align:start position:0%
low 20 years from now which everyone
 
02:07:02.209 --> 02:07:02.219 align:start position:0%
tells us is going to go way up due to
 
02:07:04.550 --> 02:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
EVs and electric heat
 
02:07:05.930 --> 02:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
02:07:07.970 --> 02:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
representative and that's why it's uh
 
02:07:10.250 --> 02:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
it's approximately 20 as 2 million
 
02:07:12.169 --> 02:07:12.179 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours but the statute
 
02:07:13.970 --> 02:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
make gives it that defined number of two
 
02:07:16.490 --> 02:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
so let's define it okay follow-up
 
02:07:19.070 --> 02:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah uh the other thing I was
 
02:07:21.470 --> 02:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
concerned about when looking at page two
 
02:07:24.530 --> 02:07:24.540 align:start position:0%
under the definitions uh lines starting
 
02:07:28.070 --> 02:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
in line 19 new electric resources and
 
02:07:30.890 --> 02:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
incremental electric energy sources I've
 
02:07:34.430 --> 02:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
read this probably 50 times and 25 of
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
the times I read it and said well
 
02:07:37.790 --> 02:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
something like Hydro Quebec would
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
qualify if it was a new transmission
 
02:07:41.629 --> 02:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
line and the other 25 percent say no
 
02:07:42.890 --> 02:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
because that's not a new generation
 
02:07:44.689 --> 02:07:44.699 align:start position:0%
Source they're getting the electricity
 
02:07:46.910 --> 02:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
from an existing generator just being
 
02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
via a new transmission line so is the
 
02:07:52.609 --> 02:07:52.619 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill that we could if we
 
02:07:54.410 --> 02:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
could ever do it build a new
 
02:07:56.930 --> 02:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
transmission line down from Canada and
 
02:07:59.810 --> 02:07:59.820 align:start position:0%
that would qualify under this and if so
 
02:08:01.550 --> 02:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
do you think we need to clarify the
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
language so the the sort of clarifying
 
02:08:06.290 --> 02:08:06.300 align:start position:0%
the distinguishing point is that these
 
02:08:07.729 --> 02:08:07.739 align:start position:0%
are resources that provide additional
 
02:08:09.290 --> 02:08:09.300 align:start position:0%
energy into the iso New England
 
02:08:11.149 --> 02:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
Marketplace I'm sorry I didn't quite
 
02:08:13.609 --> 02:08:13.619 align:start position:0%
into the iso New England Marketplace so
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
that that's in line 20.
 
02:08:19.850 --> 02:08:19.860 align:start position:0%
so therefore a a new transmission line
 
02:08:22.370 --> 02:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
interconnecting to the ISO
 
02:08:24.890 --> 02:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
grid Grid in New England would qualify
 
02:08:26.810 --> 02:08:26.820 align:start position:0%
as a new resource just quick follow-up
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
but I'm a little concerned with the
 
02:08:31.550 --> 02:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
lawyers could get on this and say no no
 
02:08:34.070 --> 02:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
no maybe that needs to be clarified to
 
02:08:36.169 --> 02:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
say including new transmission so it's
 
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
not some good limited to just new
 
02:08:40.490 --> 02:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
generation and that might not be the
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
case from Hydro Quebec that would be up
 
02:08:45.410 --> 02:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
to the committee's discretion thank you
 
02:08:48.109 --> 02:08:48.119 align:start position:0%
okay more questions from the committee
 
02:08:48.119 --> 02:08:50.149 align:start position:0%
okay more questions from the committee
representative

02:08:50.149 --> 02:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh McGee has a question
 
02:08:54.109 --> 02:08:54.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:08:55.550 --> 02:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:08:58.010 --> 02:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
okay so we uh we understand that we're
 
02:08:59.330 --> 02:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
kind of all in agreement that we want to
 
02:09:01.070 --> 02:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
do something about price volatility and
 
02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
try to figure out how to help stabilize
 
02:09:04.970 --> 02:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
um the energy that we're using
 
02:09:08.270 --> 02:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
especially through winter Peak but I I
 
02:09:10.729 --> 02:09:10.739 align:start position:0%
I'd like you to say a little more in
 
02:09:12.790 --> 02:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
your intro Mr Elms you talked about
 
02:09:16.070 --> 02:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
choosing technology neutral over
 
02:09:18.169 --> 02:09:18.179 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
02:09:19.970 --> 02:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
the general support for competitive
 
02:09:21.890 --> 02:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
markets and I guess my my concern is
 
02:09:23.450 --> 02:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
what we've been hearing from many of the
 
02:09:24.410 --> 02:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
people that have been submitting
 
02:09:26.810 --> 02:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
testimonies concern around the effect on
 
02:09:29.330 --> 02:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
the wholesale markets the effect on the
 
02:09:31.609 --> 02:09:31.619 align:start position:0%
competitive markets which help us to
 
02:09:33.890 --> 02:09:33.900 align:start position:0%
hedge and push downward pressure on
 
02:09:36.290 --> 02:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
costs so could you talk a little bit
 
02:09:39.470 --> 02:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
about uh what what locking in does with
 
02:09:41.209 --> 02:09:41.219 align:start position:0%
the advantages the built-in advantages
 
02:09:44.209 --> 02:09:44.219 align:start position:0%
that that the utilities have in order to
 
02:09:46.070 --> 02:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
roll in their costs like interconnection
 
02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
and other things that other players in
 
02:09:50.930 --> 02:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
the market would not if you could
 
02:09:50.940 --> 02:09:52.310 align:start position:0%
the market would not if you could
um

02:09:52.310 --> 02:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:54.649 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:09:54.649 --> 02:09:54.659 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:54.659 --> 02:09:57.109 align:start position:0%
so
the

02:09:57.109 --> 02:09:57.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:10:01.129 --> 02:10:01.139 align:start position:0%
the bill would allow essentially the the
 
02:10:02.830 --> 02:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
price to
 
02:10:05.570 --> 02:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
be part of the utilities rates over the
 
02:10:07.370 --> 02:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
course of the agreement
 
02:10:11.629 --> 02:10:11.639 align:start position:0%
um that you know takes 20 out of play
 
02:10:13.910 --> 02:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
out of out of the year to year
 
02:10:16.790 --> 02:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
day-to-day energy markets so the
 
02:10:19.930 --> 02:10:19.940 align:start position:0%
remaining 80 is still uh
 
02:10:23.570 --> 02:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
exposed to the markets and what may come
 
02:10:26.870 --> 02:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
of that but this stabilizes prices by
 
02:10:28.910 --> 02:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
removing that demand from
 
02:10:32.450 --> 02:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:36.290 --> 02:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
follow up so I guess my thought or my
 
02:10:39.109 --> 02:10:39.119 align:start position:0%
question or concern is around what it
 
02:10:40.850 --> 02:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
does to the price signals in the market
 
02:10:45.290 --> 02:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
it don't let Dan speak more technically
 
02:10:49.490 --> 02:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
about it but yet you know look those
 
02:10:50.750 --> 02:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
those are sort of where we've had
 
02:10:52.250 --> 02:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
historical concerns with government
 
02:10:53.930 --> 02:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
interventions in this way you know our
 
02:10:55.629 --> 02:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
state energy strategy does talk about it
 
02:10:58.010 --> 02:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
goal six of the state energy strategy
 
02:10:59.390 --> 02:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
says that government interventions in
 
02:11:02.030 --> 02:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
the market should be limited justifiable
 
02:11:04.370 --> 02:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
and Technology neutral so you know
 
02:11:06.530 --> 02:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
looking at the the bigger problem right
 
02:11:08.930 --> 02:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
you know the you're right there are
 
02:11:11.149 --> 02:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
impacts on on the market with with any
 
02:11:11.159 --> 02:11:12.770 align:start position:0%
impacts on on the market with with any
intervention

02:11:12.770 --> 02:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
um but that bigger problem of that we're
 
02:11:16.850 --> 02:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
facing with be it price be it winter
 
02:11:19.609 --> 02:11:19.619 align:start position:0%
reliability you know says to us we need
 
02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
to build something we need to show that
 
02:11:23.990 --> 02:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
we can build something and and incent
 
02:11:25.550 --> 02:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
that and
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
um you know that's something that you
 
02:11:29.209 --> 02:11:29.219 align:start position:0%
know this committee has to balance when
 
02:11:31.070 --> 02:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
when making that policy decision I don't
 
02:11:32.330 --> 02:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
know if you have anything you want to
 
02:11:36.490 --> 02:11:36.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:40.129 --> 02:11:40.139 align:start position:0%
okay representative Doug Thomas has a
 
02:11:41.450 --> 02:11:41.460 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:11:46.490 --> 02:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:48.169 --> 02:11:48.179 align:start position:0%
is this
 
02:11:51.470 --> 02:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
this is a kind of a large-scale policy
 
02:11:55.129 --> 02:11:55.139 align:start position:0%
change is this intended to be permanent
 
02:11:58.070 --> 02:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
or just during the period of of what
 
02:12:00.890 --> 02:12:00.900 align:start position:0%
we're facing right now and how does this
 
02:12:02.629 --> 02:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
um how does this fit into your 10-year
 
02:12:03.830 --> 02:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
energy plan
 
02:12:06.229 --> 02:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
yeah sure um it's a good question thank
 
02:12:10.129 --> 02:12:10.139 align:start position:0%
you for it um so so this bill does allow
 
02:12:13.010 --> 02:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
up to 20-year contracts so that is uh
 
02:12:14.689 --> 02:12:14.699 align:start position:0%
you know the term that we we could be
 
02:12:17.149 --> 02:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
looking at here uh there are given the
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
timelines in in the legislation it's not
 
02:12:21.109 --> 02:12:21.119 align:start position:0%
an open-ended ability for folks to come
 
02:12:23.930 --> 02:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
before the puc uh it's only the next a
 
02:12:26.270 --> 02:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
couple couple years several years
 
02:12:27.169 --> 02:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
um where they can bring those forward
 
02:12:28.970 --> 02:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
but yeah there would be potentially
 
02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
long-term you know
 
02:12:33.470 --> 02:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
um effects should the puc approve a
 
02:12:36.830 --> 02:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
contract of uh 20 years you know as I
 
02:12:38.930 --> 02:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
said before I think in terms of the
 
02:12:40.189 --> 02:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
relationship with the state energy
 
02:12:42.830 --> 02:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
strategy you know um in looking at the
 
02:12:46.010 --> 02:12:46.020 align:start position:0%
goals of reliability price uh you know
 
02:12:48.770 --> 02:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
just cost Effectiveness and sort of that
 
02:12:51.169 --> 02:12:51.179 align:start position:0%
idea that that whatever our intervention
 
02:12:54.890 --> 02:12:54.900 align:start position:0%
is as sort of policy makers
 
02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
um it should be limited it should have
 
02:12:59.870 --> 02:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
you know an actual defined goal and it
 
02:13:01.609 --> 02:13:01.619 align:start position:0%
should be technology neutral we think
 
02:13:02.689 --> 02:13:02.699 align:start position:0%
this fits in with the state energy
 
02:13:02.699 --> 02:13:04.010 align:start position:0%
this fits in with the state energy
strategy

02:13:04.010 --> 02:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
strategy
 
02:13:06.290 --> 02:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
um and and it's up to the legislature to
 
02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not this is a
 
02:13:09.950 --> 02:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
policy change that you want to make
 
02:13:12.530 --> 02:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you thank you for the
 
02:13:17.030 --> 02:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up so uh do you feel do we have a
 
02:13:19.069 --> 02:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
way if we guess wrong
 
02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
like we often do
 
02:13:23.750 --> 02:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
if we guess wrong and find out that it
 
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
has the opposite effect is there a way
 
02:13:27.770 --> 02:13:27.780 align:start position:0%
that we can
 
02:13:30.050 --> 02:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
get out of this if if we if with the
 
02:13:34.129 --> 02:13:34.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:37.129 --> 02:13:37.139 align:start position:0%
I believe the answer is no this this is
 
02:13:39.229 --> 02:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
a inherent part of the risk of long-term
 
02:13:43.250 --> 02:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
contracts and I I mentioned earlier that
 
02:13:46.550 --> 02:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
sort of any above Market piece is is
 
02:13:49.550 --> 02:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
essentially the cost of the Hedge
 
02:13:52.850 --> 02:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
um so if if there's a scenario where
 
02:13:55.490 --> 02:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
this contract becomes uh a bad deal
 
02:13:58.069 --> 02:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
we've paid that money for Price
 
02:13:58.079 --> 02:13:59.149 align:start position:0%
we've paid that money for Price
stability

02:13:59.149 --> 02:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
stability
 
02:14:01.850 --> 02:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
and can I can I also just move back to
 
02:14:03.649 --> 02:14:03.659 align:start position:0%
your first question
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
um where if I'll point you to page two
 
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
line 29 that sets an end date for the
 
02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
ability of the utilities to enter into
 
02:14:13.609 --> 02:14:13.619 align:start position:0%
these rfps
 
02:14:17.149 --> 02:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
um there is an energy transition going
 
02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
on in the region and we don't want this
 
02:14:23.209 --> 02:14:23.219 align:start position:0%
to be our permanent solution but there
 
02:14:27.229 --> 02:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
is a a acute need for something to be
 
02:14:29.390 --> 02:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
done to stabilize prices and and move
 
02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:30.950 align:start position:0%
done to stabilize prices and and move
forward

02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:14:33.709 --> 02:14:33.719 align:start position:0%
and and if I may um you know obviously
 
02:14:35.089 --> 02:14:35.099 align:start position:0%
there is a risk that this is a bad deal
 
02:14:37.069 --> 02:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
there's also a potential opportunity and
 
02:14:38.390 --> 02:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
there have been contracts that we've
 
02:14:40.430 --> 02:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
seen where where if you look at the last
 
02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
year folks were able to you know find
 
02:14:45.169 --> 02:14:45.179 align:start position:0%
savings for their ratepayers by having
 
02:14:46.910 --> 02:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
entered into a long-term deal so that's
 
02:14:51.290 --> 02:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:52.910 --> 02:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
okay represent
 
02:14:54.530 --> 02:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
representative Munns has a question
 
02:14:57.050 --> 02:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for uh
 
02:14:58.910 --> 02:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
taking our questions
 
02:15:01.250 --> 02:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm I'm struggling with the fact
 
02:15:04.910 --> 02:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
that as I understand it we have a
 
02:15:08.270 --> 02:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
um a system where the utilities the
 
02:15:11.810 --> 02:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
three utilities are the providers of of
 
02:15:14.209 --> 02:15:14.219 align:start position:0%
Last Resort for power
 
02:15:16.729 --> 02:15:16.739 align:start position:0%
they're really only there in in the
 
02:15:19.069 --> 02:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
event that someone decides that they
 
02:15:21.290 --> 02:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
don't want to enter into an agreement
 
02:15:22.970 --> 02:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
with a with an independent power
 
02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:24.770 align:start position:0%
with a with an independent power
producer

02:15:24.770 --> 02:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
producer
 
02:15:24.780 --> 02:15:25.729 align:start position:0%
producer
um

02:15:25.729 --> 02:15:25.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:31.490 --> 02:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:35.450 --> 02:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
um why not ins instead of putting this
 
02:15:39.649 --> 02:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
or instead of giving this this uh this
 
02:15:39.659 --> 02:15:40.270 align:start position:0%
or instead of giving this this uh this
um

02:15:40.270 --> 02:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:44.209 --> 02:15:44.219 align:start position:0%
option to the utilities why aren't we
 
02:15:46.990 --> 02:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
trying to do more to encourage
 
02:15:50.750 --> 02:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
the power producers for the independent
 
02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:52.250 align:start position:0%
the power producers for the independent
suppliers

02:15:52.250 --> 02:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
suppliers
 
02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:03.119 --> 02:16:05.149 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:16:05.149 --> 02:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
this is this is one piece of of the
 
02:16:12.410 --> 02:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
puzzle uh we
 
02:16:16.790 --> 02:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
have limited ability to direct those
 
02:16:18.649 --> 02:16:18.659 align:start position:0%
suppliers to to do
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
much of anything it's their their idea
 
02:16:23.209 --> 02:16:23.219 align:start position:0%
of if they want to play ball if they
 
02:16:25.609 --> 02:16:25.619 align:start position:0%
want to walk away from their resources
 
02:16:27.669 --> 02:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
that's their prerogative
 
02:16:31.129 --> 02:16:31.139 align:start position:0%
this is a way that the state can direct
 
02:16:33.169 --> 02:16:33.179 align:start position:0%
this investment
 
02:16:33.179 --> 02:16:34.490 align:start position:0%
this investment
um

02:16:34.490 --> 02:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:36.049 --> 02:16:36.059 align:start position:0%
and that's through through this function
 
02:16:40.849 --> 02:16:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:42.709 --> 02:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
02:16:44.750 --> 02:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:16:46.310 --> 02:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm actually going to
 
02:16:48.290 --> 02:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
rephrase a question I asked earlier to
 
02:16:51.049 --> 02:16:51.059 align:start position:0%
the senator and that is on the uh
 
02:16:53.750 --> 02:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
contract and Contra if a contract
 
02:16:56.089 --> 02:16:56.099 align:start position:0%
becomes unfeasible for a power generator
 
02:16:58.490 --> 02:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
where they can't afford it to ensure
 
02:17:00.110 --> 02:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
that the state doesn't fall on the hook
 
02:17:03.110 --> 02:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
of for it is there is there guidelines
 
02:17:05.690 --> 02:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
in this current bill to foreign exit
 
02:17:07.730 --> 02:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
strategy for them to actually cancel or
 
02:17:10.129 --> 02:17:10.139 align:start position:0%
get out of the bill and if not should
 
02:17:11.929 --> 02:17:11.939 align:start position:0%
there be guidelines added to this bill
 
02:17:14.089 --> 02:17:14.099 align:start position:0%
to make to ensure that the state doesn't
 
02:17:16.969 --> 02:17:16.979 align:start position:0%
fall to pay for that
 
02:17:16.979 --> 02:17:17.929 align:start position:0%
fall to pay for that
um

02:17:17.929 --> 02:17:17.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:17.939 --> 02:17:19.549 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:17:19.549 --> 02:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:17:19.559 --> 02:17:21.410 align:start position:0%
so
the

02:17:21.410 --> 02:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:17:24.410 --> 02:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
the bill as written I believe would not
 
02:17:26.750 --> 02:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
afford the opportunity for a developer
 
02:17:29.629 --> 02:17:29.639 align:start position:0%
to back out and this is something that
 
02:17:32.650 --> 02:17:32.660 align:start position:0%
we're seeing currently legis um
 
02:17:35.450 --> 02:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
adjudicated adjudicated uh in
 
02:17:36.709 --> 02:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts with some of their
 
02:17:39.049 --> 02:17:39.059 align:start position:0%
offshore wind developments uh the the
 
02:17:42.169 --> 02:17:42.179 align:start position:0%
due to the pandemic a lot of labor costs
 
02:17:44.270 --> 02:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
Rose over the course from what the
 
02:17:46.490 --> 02:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
utilities originally bid in they've
 
02:17:49.070 --> 02:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
tried to get out of the contracts and
 
02:17:51.110 --> 02:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
actually them getting out of the
 
02:17:53.389 --> 02:17:53.399 align:start position:0%
contracts represents a bad deal for rate
 
02:17:58.129 --> 02:17:58.139 align:start position:0%
payers because it's it's them leaving an
 
02:18:01.730 --> 02:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
agreement that is now worse than market
 
02:18:04.969 --> 02:18:04.979 align:start position:0%
value the therefore the utilities the
 
02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
rate payers are set to receive below
 
02:18:10.129 --> 02:18:10.139 align:start position:0%
Market power and that's that's actually
 
02:18:13.190 --> 02:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
a good outcome for rate payers
 
02:18:16.190 --> 02:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
okay lots of other folks to hear from
 
02:18:17.589 --> 02:18:17.599 align:start position:0%
seeing no
 
02:18:20.690 --> 02:18:20.700 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
02:18:22.190 --> 02:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
yeah sort of a follow-up from
 
02:18:24.169 --> 02:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
representative Munn's question there we
 
02:18:27.349 --> 02:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
if the way I understand this there's
 
02:18:28.790 --> 02:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
nothing that prevents the competitive
 
02:18:31.370 --> 02:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
suppliers and a good deal of residential
 
02:18:34.429 --> 02:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
and Commercial uh electric uses use
 
02:18:36.830 --> 02:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers if this is such a
 
02:18:39.290 --> 02:18:39.300 align:start position:0%
good idea to sign 20-year contracts
 
02:18:41.570 --> 02:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
why aren't they doing it and if they are
 
02:18:43.549 --> 02:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
why do we need the why do we need to
 
02:18:45.650 --> 02:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
mandate that or or say that the
 
02:18:47.990 --> 02:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
utilities can do it without any risk at
 
02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.570 align:start position:0%
utilities can do it without any risk at
all

02:18:50.570 --> 02:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:53.389 --> 02:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
I I am not familiar with the procurement
 
02:18:55.730 --> 02:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
practices of the various defaults
 
02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers so I can't answer
 
02:19:00.169 --> 02:19:00.179 align:start position:0%
that question quick follow-up follow-up
 
02:19:02.570 --> 02:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
uh did in the discussions of this bill
 
02:19:03.950 --> 02:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
you obviously did a lot of negotiations
 
02:19:06.709 --> 02:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
you said uh one other thing that is
 
02:19:08.570 --> 02:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
blatantly different between a
 
02:19:10.310 --> 02:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
competitive supplier and a util a
 
02:19:12.589 --> 02:19:12.599 align:start position:0%
utilities default service rate is they
 
02:19:14.509 --> 02:19:14.519 align:start position:0%
sign a contract whatever the costs are
 
02:19:16.370 --> 02:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
they pass on directly to the rate payers
 
02:19:19.490 --> 02:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
if this contract is a good deal the rate
 
02:19:20.990 --> 02:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
payers will save money if it's a bad
 
02:19:23.089 --> 02:19:23.099 align:start position:0%
deal the rate payers will lose money was
 
02:19:25.429 --> 02:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
there any uh discussion of the utility
 
02:19:27.469 --> 02:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
taking some risk like competitive
 
02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
suppliers have to do so if they were
 
02:19:31.969 --> 02:19:31.979 align:start position:0%
saving the rate payers money they would
 
02:19:33.830 --> 02:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
get they would make more profit but if
 
02:19:35.810 --> 02:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
they were losing the costing the rate
 
02:19:37.370 --> 02:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
pay as additional charges they would
 
02:19:39.230 --> 02:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
make less money that would cost was
 
02:19:41.089 --> 02:19:41.099 align:start position:0%
there any discussion on risk sharing
 
02:19:43.370 --> 02:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
with the utilities yeah it's a it's a
 
02:19:45.469 --> 02:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
sensible idea it's not one that we've
 
02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
had time to work through and and it's
 
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
not one that's currently in the the
 
02:19:51.429 --> 02:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
legislative station
 
02:19:54.650 --> 02:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
if if it were the committee's desire to
 
02:19:56.030 --> 02:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
see something like that I would I would
 
02:19:56.040 --> 02:19:58.130 align:start position:0%
see something like that I would I would
suggest

02:19:58.130 --> 02:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
02:20:01.070 --> 02:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
making that a consideration that the puc
 
02:20:03.830 --> 02:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
would would need to take into account
 
02:20:09.889 --> 02:20:09.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:12.590 --> 02:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
did you have another uh no it came out
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
on it no that's okay thanks
 
02:20:15.950 --> 02:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:20:17.750 --> 02:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions for these
 
02:20:19.790 --> 02:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
gentlemen who I'm sure will hang around
 
02:20:22.370 --> 02:20:22.380 align:start position:0%
in case other questions surface let's
 
02:20:23.990 --> 02:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
get another point of view now and call
 
02:20:25.730 --> 02:20:25.740 align:start position:0%
Dan Dolan from the New England power
 
02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
generators Association to tell us about
 
02:20:31.490 --> 02:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
why the
 
02:20:35.510 --> 02:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
any PGA opposes this bill
 
02:20:38.750 --> 02:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:41.450 --> 02:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
good morning again uh and I'm also here
 
02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
with my colleague Molly Connors I'm Dan
 
02:20:45.770 --> 02:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
Dolan president of the New England power
 
02:20:48.230 --> 02:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
generator Association uh what I should
 
02:20:49.730 --> 02:20:49.740 align:start position:0%
have said the first time I was in front
 
02:20:52.969 --> 02:20:52.979 align:start position:0%
of you this morning is uh who we are so
 
02:20:54.710 --> 02:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
New England power generator Association
 
02:20:57.770 --> 02:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
represents a little over 90 percent of
 
02:21:00.170 --> 02:21:00.180 align:start position:0%
the install generating capacity in New
 
02:21:02.570 --> 02:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
England and a comparable app amount here
 
02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh to boil that all the
 
02:21:07.490 --> 02:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
way down we effectively represent the
 
02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the existing power
 
02:21:11.870 --> 02:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
generation sources
 
02:21:13.929 --> 02:21:13.939 align:start position:0%
as has been
 
02:21:17.090 --> 02:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
noted several times in the descriptions
 
02:21:20.630 --> 02:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
of this legislation uh this bill is
 
02:21:23.389 --> 02:21:23.399 align:start position:0%
explicitly about new sources of of
 
02:21:26.690 --> 02:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
generation and incremental uh Supply
 
02:21:29.090 --> 02:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
um we have a much more extensive uh
 
02:21:30.530 --> 02:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
written testimony that I'm going to do
 
02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
my best to summarize uh rather quickly
 
02:21:37.490 --> 02:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
here but the the the core of of that is
 
02:21:39.770 --> 02:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
that our members live and die on their
 
02:21:41.990 --> 02:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
capability to be economic in the market
 
02:21:44.570 --> 02:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
that they offer uh every single day to
 
02:21:46.309 --> 02:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
provide the actual energy to keep the
 
02:21:50.090 --> 02:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
lights on here and then uh one time in
 
02:21:53.570 --> 02:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
an auction three years out every year to
 
02:21:55.849 --> 02:21:55.859 align:start position:0%
provide the the capacity the commitment
 
02:21:58.849 --> 02:21:58.859 align:start position:0%
to be available to provide all that
 
02:22:01.849 --> 02:22:01.859 align:start position:0%
electricity because they live and die on
 
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
that competitive market any carve out
 
02:22:08.349 --> 02:22:08.359 align:start position:0%
any uh subsidy for a particular resource
 
02:22:11.150 --> 02:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
undermines the economics of those
 
02:22:14.030 --> 02:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
resources that provide today's most
 
02:22:15.889 --> 02:22:15.899 align:start position:0%
economic power and the reliability
 
02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
Services associated with that and it is
 
02:22:20.929 --> 02:22:20.939 align:start position:0%
why we are so consistently in front of
 
02:22:24.410 --> 02:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
you all opposing those types of
 
02:22:26.389 --> 02:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
proposals and why we are here today
 
02:22:29.870 --> 02:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
opposing this legislation uh as I heard
 
02:22:31.490 --> 02:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
the description
 
02:22:34.309 --> 02:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
um uh this bill is primarily designed
 
02:22:37.730 --> 02:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
around trying to stabilize and create
 
02:22:41.590 --> 02:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
more affordable default Energy Service
 
02:22:43.910 --> 02:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
following the the extreme volatility
 
02:22:47.030 --> 02:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
that we did see last year as well as to
 
02:22:49.969 --> 02:22:49.979 align:start position:0%
support winter reliability I do not
 
02:22:51.230 --> 02:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
believe that this is the right
 
02:22:51.240 --> 02:22:52.670 align:start position:0%
believe that this is the right
prescription

02:22:52.670 --> 02:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
02:22:55.130 --> 02:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
um for for any of those things in this
 
02:22:56.830 --> 02:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
this current market
 
02:23:00.590 --> 02:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
this would carve out roughly 20 percent
 
02:23:04.389 --> 02:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
of of the market on these multi-decade
 
02:23:07.849 --> 02:23:07.859 align:start position:0%
contracts and realistically given the
 
02:23:09.469 --> 02:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
the current constraints that we do see
 
02:23:12.770 --> 02:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
from a a sighting a few fuel delivery
 
02:23:15.170 --> 02:23:15.180 align:start position:0%
and and other opportunities within the
 
02:23:17.990 --> 02:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
market we look at this as as largely
 
02:23:21.429 --> 02:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
about some combination of offshore wind
 
02:23:25.670 --> 02:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
Canadian Hydro Imports or some small
 
02:23:28.190 --> 02:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
scale solar Plus Storage maybe around
 
02:23:32.210 --> 02:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
the edges again as we look at issues
 
02:23:35.150 --> 02:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
around winter reliability I would argue
 
02:23:38.929 --> 02:23:38.939 align:start position:0%
that those resources do not meaningfully
 
02:23:41.389 --> 02:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
impact the the peak periods that we have
 
02:23:44.210 --> 02:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
seen within New England we need to only
 
02:23:47.630 --> 02:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
look this past winter where for despite
 
02:23:49.610 --> 02:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
it being a relatively mild winter
 
02:23:52.070 --> 02:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
overall we did see two peak extreme
 
02:23:54.950 --> 02:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
situations during the winter one on
 
02:23:58.429 --> 02:23:58.439 align:start position:0%
Christmas weekend in which we saw
 
02:24:02.809 --> 02:24:02.819 align:start position:0%
roughly 1700 megawatts of Canadian Hydro
 
02:24:05.570 --> 02:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
pullback during that event which then
 
02:24:08.510 --> 02:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
triggered New England going into a
 
02:24:10.490 --> 02:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
reserve deficiency which means not that
 
02:24:12.230 --> 02:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
the lights were going out from a supply
 
02:24:14.750 --> 02:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
side but that all the resources we hold
 
02:24:17.090 --> 02:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
in reserves we had to dip far more into
 
02:24:20.090 --> 02:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
into those Reserve capabilities than
 
02:24:21.530 --> 02:24:21.540 align:start position:0%
it's frankly comfortable and then
 
02:24:24.530 --> 02:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
triggers a a pay for performance and
 
02:24:26.090 --> 02:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
event which means any facility that
 
02:24:28.910 --> 02:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't online at that time has to pay a
 
02:24:28.920 --> 02:24:29.929 align:start position:0%
wasn't online at that time has to pay a
penalty

02:24:29.929 --> 02:24:29.939 align:start position:0%
penalty
 
02:24:32.389 --> 02:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
which then goes to any facility that
 
02:24:34.910 --> 02:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
overperformed helped ensure that we were
 
02:24:36.830 --> 02:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
able to keep the lights on and and the
 
02:24:40.010 --> 02:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
reserves capable a second one is on
 
02:24:42.110 --> 02:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
February 3rd and 4th which was the
 
02:24:44.809 --> 02:24:44.819 align:start position:0%
coldest day we've seen in decades across
 
02:24:46.370 --> 02:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
particularly Northern New England but
 
02:24:48.950 --> 02:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
really across the region on that day
 
02:24:52.010 --> 02:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
February 4th Saturday morning for the
 
02:24:54.469 --> 02:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
entire morning ramp so roughly six to
 
02:24:56.750 --> 02:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
eight hours that day
 
02:24:58.910 --> 02:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
we were actually sending a thousand
 
02:25:00.830 --> 02:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
megawatts from New England North to
 
02:25:03.050 --> 02:25:03.060 align:start position:0%
Quebec to help keep the lights on there
 
02:25:05.570 --> 02:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
at the very moment that Hydro Quebec was
 
02:25:07.610 --> 02:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
going on the radio and on television
 
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
stations asking for all consumers in
 
02:25:12.290 --> 02:25:12.300 align:start position:0%
Quebec to conserve electricity because
 
02:25:13.969 --> 02:25:13.979 align:start position:0%
not only did they have to import a
 
02:25:15.349 --> 02:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
thousand megawatts from New England they
 
02:25:17.510 --> 02:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
had to import a thousand megawatts from
 
02:25:19.550 --> 02:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
Ontario and another thousand megawatts
 
02:25:21.469 --> 02:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
from from New York they hit an all-time
 
02:25:24.830 --> 02:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
Peak uh on that Saturday morning of 40
 
02:25:26.210 --> 02:25:26.220 align:start position:0%
000 megawatts
 
02:25:28.610 --> 02:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
and look that's the way neighboring
 
02:25:30.950 --> 02:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
regions should work in the same way that
 
02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
we import from Hydro Quebec throughout
 
02:25:36.490 --> 02:25:36.500 align:start position:0%
most of of the year we do it today
 
02:25:40.070 --> 02:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
during that period of peak winter Demand
 
02:25:42.590 --> 02:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
on those two occasions when we need it
 
02:25:45.770 --> 02:25:45.780 align:start position:0%
most it is not providing some of that
 
02:25:48.590 --> 02:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
those core reliability services and
 
02:25:51.170 --> 02:25:51.180 align:start position:0%
certainly as we look at price reduction
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
based on uh default energy rates my
 
02:25:56.090 --> 02:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
argument is that as we do see the
 
02:25:58.610 --> 02:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
existing contracts on some of those
 
02:26:01.309 --> 02:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
other resources noted it does not
 
02:26:04.070 --> 02:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
provide that and then where I I'd like
 
02:26:06.170 --> 02:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
to end here is is touch on what has been
 
02:26:08.510 --> 02:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
brought up several times which is our
 
02:26:11.330 --> 02:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
history with some of these long-term
 
02:26:13.070 --> 02:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
obligations trying to gaze into our
 
02:26:15.110 --> 02:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
crystal ball and predict what the market
 
02:26:17.210 --> 02:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
is going to do just a few years into the
 
02:26:20.030 --> 02:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
future let alone uh decades we have the
 
02:26:22.190 --> 02:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
example of the Berlin biomass facility
 
02:26:23.990 --> 02:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
we have the example of some of the
 
02:26:25.910 --> 02:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
stranded costs in other areas we also
 
02:26:28.490 --> 02:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
have the example of the the scrubber on
 
02:26:31.250 --> 02:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
the Merrimack station and and the cost
 
02:26:32.990 --> 02:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
explosions that that came out of that
 
02:26:34.910 --> 02:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
and then certainly on the other side of
 
02:26:37.309 --> 02:26:37.319 align:start position:0%
the equation uh you see some of the
 
02:26:39.110 --> 02:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
seller's remorse that is being litigated
 
02:26:40.790 --> 02:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
today in Massachusetts and Connecticut
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
on offshore wind on contracts that are
 
02:26:45.950 --> 02:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
less than a year old in which those
 
02:26:48.410 --> 02:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
suppliers are trying to get out of that
 
02:26:50.870 --> 02:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
um at its core I think there's a very
 
02:26:52.910 --> 02:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
good reason that New Hampshire for a
 
02:26:54.590 --> 02:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
long time has had a policy of being
 
02:26:57.349 --> 02:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
enormously skeptical if not downright
 
02:26:59.570 --> 02:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
opposed to the policies that are being
 
02:27:02.389 --> 02:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
put forward here and certainly any state
 
02:27:05.630 --> 02:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
has an uh has an opportunity has the
 
02:27:08.750 --> 02:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
right to to change its policy but that
 
02:27:11.030 --> 02:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
last 10-year energy plan was based on
 
02:27:14.450 --> 02:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
rigorous analysis done over several
 
02:27:16.910 --> 02:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
months speaking to dozens of
 
02:27:18.469 --> 02:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and creating a
 
02:27:20.450 --> 02:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
comprehensive analysis and report that
 
02:27:22.910 --> 02:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
was then further considered by this body
 
02:27:25.309 --> 02:27:25.319 align:start position:0%
I think a similar deliberative process
 
02:27:26.809 --> 02:27:26.819 align:start position:0%
would be necessary if we're going to
 
02:27:31.250 --> 02:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
make a sea change of this scale to uh to
 
02:27:33.590 --> 02:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
be able to to justify carving out twenty
 
02:27:35.450 --> 02:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
percent one-fifth of the electricity
 
02:27:37.370 --> 02:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
Market in New Hampshire and it is for
 
02:27:40.250 --> 02:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
all those reasons that our organization
 
02:27:44.330 --> 02:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
strongly urges that uh this bill be
 
02:27:46.849 --> 02:27:46.859 align:start position:0%
deemed in expedient to legislate and
 
02:27:48.590 --> 02:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
that we maintain some of the policies
 
02:27:49.790 --> 02:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
and allow
 
02:27:52.849 --> 02:27:52.859 align:start position:0%
um also the puc to conduct the analysis
 
02:27:55.010 --> 02:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
that is ongoing on how to better
 
02:27:57.050 --> 02:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
structure the default energy rates with
 
02:27:58.730 --> 02:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
that thank you Mr chairman and members
 
02:28:00.590 --> 02:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
02:28:02.389 --> 02:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Ms Connors do you have
 
02:28:04.070 --> 02:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
anything to add or you're just here to
 
02:28:05.690 --> 02:28:05.700 align:start position:0%
answer questions no I'm sensitive to the
 
02:28:07.969 --> 02:28:07.979 align:start position:0%
committee's time okay thank you all
 
02:28:10.010 --> 02:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
right questions from the committee for
 
02:28:11.690 --> 02:28:11.700 align:start position:0%
the New England power generators
 
02:28:11.700 --> 02:28:13.610 align:start position:0%
the New England power generators
Association

02:28:13.610 --> 02:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
Association
 
02:28:16.070 --> 02:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has one thank
 
02:28:17.510 --> 02:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and then taking the
 
02:28:19.010 --> 02:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
question there's been a lot of
 
02:28:21.650 --> 02:28:21.660 align:start position:0%
discussion here today about uh and
 
02:28:23.870 --> 02:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
almost a panic over what happened this
 
02:28:25.969 --> 02:28:25.979 align:start position:0%
past winter electric rates exploded it
 
02:28:28.010 --> 02:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
was the end of the world and uh actually
 
02:28:30.050 --> 02:28:30.060 align:start position:0%
there were no blackouts but just looking
 
02:28:33.290 --> 02:28:33.300 align:start position:0%
at ISO New England's output there the
 
02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
actual gas prices with 38 percent lower
 
02:28:37.910 --> 02:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
this winter than they were a year ago
 
02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
and the real-time electric rates were 25
 
02:28:44.090 --> 02:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
percent lower so we were sort of like
 
02:28:45.710 --> 02:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
reacting would you agree we're reacting
 
02:28:48.110 --> 02:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
to last Winter's higher prices where a
 
02:28:49.610 --> 02:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
lot of people didn't capture the money
 
02:28:52.130 --> 02:28:52.140 align:start position:0%
that they thought and this and this the
 
02:28:54.830 --> 02:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
market settling out now and maybe it's
 
02:28:58.070 --> 02:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
just not time to completely panic
 
02:28:59.510 --> 02:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
so we're very good at fighting
 
02:29:02.750 --> 02:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday's Wars uh and and and look
 
02:29:05.150 --> 02:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
last year was extraordinary
 
02:29:07.370 --> 02:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
um uh I think it was commissioner alums
 
02:29:10.010 --> 02:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
noted this was an extraordinary moment
 
02:29:11.809 --> 02:29:11.819 align:start position:0%
in in the energy markets and there's no
 
02:29:12.889 --> 02:29:12.899 align:start position:0%
question about it I saw the most
 
02:29:15.290 --> 02:29:15.300 align:start position:0%
volatility I've seen in my career uh
 
02:29:17.090 --> 02:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
last year coming into the that market
 
02:29:19.610 --> 02:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
coming out of uh the Russian invasion of
 
02:29:22.490 --> 02:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
Ukraine and then uh the the Dual issues
 
02:29:24.830 --> 02:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
of Europe on the one hand cutting
 
02:29:26.270 --> 02:29:26.280 align:start position:0%
cutting off
 
02:29:27.950 --> 02:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
um many of its energy purchases in
 
02:29:29.630 --> 02:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
Russia then cutting off many of its
 
02:29:32.389 --> 02:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
energy exports that then created a level
 
02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
of uncertainty we've never seen in the
 
02:29:36.590 --> 02:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
energy markets and because of the way
 
02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
the default energy rates are set
 
02:29:42.230 --> 02:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh they are snapshots and
 
02:29:44.570 --> 02:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
um uh in time and expectations about
 
02:29:47.210 --> 02:29:47.220 align:start position:0%
what those next six and actually longer
 
02:29:48.830 --> 02:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
months are are going to be because you
 
02:29:51.469 --> 02:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
have as a supplier you have to offer in
 
02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
to that that six-month commitment
 
02:29:56.389 --> 02:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
actually a couple months earlier so it's
 
02:29:59.270 --> 02:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty long dated uh view overall
 
02:30:01.370 --> 02:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
and certainly you're on the hook based
 
02:30:03.290 --> 02:30:03.300 align:start position:0%
on how the market moves and because of
 
02:30:05.270 --> 02:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
the volatility you saw a very healthy
 
02:30:07.550 --> 02:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
premium offered into into those rates
 
02:30:10.370 --> 02:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
the reality was that going into the
 
02:30:12.590 --> 02:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
winter even before we saw the more mild
 
02:30:14.929 --> 02:30:14.939 align:start position:0%
temperatures we saw inventory storage
 
02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
levels up
 
02:30:19.010 --> 02:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
um in Europe which then helped stabilize
 
02:30:21.710 --> 02:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
the global LNG Market which then helped
 
02:30:23.929 --> 02:30:23.939 align:start position:0%
stabilize some of the domestic natural
 
02:30:25.730 --> 02:30:25.740 align:start position:0%
gas market particularly in the
 
02:30:27.590 --> 02:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
Mid-Atlantic and we did see a more
 
02:30:29.050 --> 02:30:29.060 align:start position:0%
healthy flow
 
02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
in this region what that now means is we
 
02:30:35.210 --> 02:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
look forward is that we are already
 
02:30:36.830 --> 02:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
starting to see in some of the other
 
02:30:40.370 --> 02:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
utility standard offer rates uh uh a
 
02:30:42.710 --> 02:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
significant drop off from uh the the
 
02:30:45.290 --> 02:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
high Winters and as we already now turn
 
02:30:48.889 --> 02:30:48.899 align:start position:0%
the calendar into uh next winter we also
 
02:30:51.710 --> 02:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
are seeing a a much more stable lower
 
02:30:54.349 --> 02:30:54.359 align:start position:0%
price level uh as expected moving
 
02:30:54.359 --> 02:30:55.309 align:start position:0%
price level uh as expected moving
forward

02:30:55.309 --> 02:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
um and so yes the the reality of what we
 
02:30:59.510 --> 02:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
saw this winter
 
02:31:01.010 --> 02:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
um was actually a much more stable
 
02:31:03.469 --> 02:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
system than frankly many of us were
 
02:31:05.510 --> 02:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
concerned we were going to see last
 
02:31:07.910 --> 02:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
summer and and last fall and that goes
 
02:31:09.650 --> 02:31:09.660 align:start position:0%
again to some of the humility I think we
 
02:31:11.870 --> 02:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
all have to have about uh what actually
 
02:31:13.190 --> 02:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
happens in the market what the
 
02:31:14.929 --> 02:31:14.939 align:start position:0%
expectations are and what the reality
 
02:31:16.610 --> 02:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
Bears out
 
02:31:19.130 --> 02:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up so what you're
 
02:31:20.929 --> 02:31:20.939 align:start position:0%
basically saying is that we have trouble
 
02:31:23.570 --> 02:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
predicting Energy prices six months in
 
02:31:26.210 --> 02:31:26.220 align:start position:0%
advance and trying to do it 20 years in
 
02:31:29.690 --> 02:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
advance is probably just a pipe dream
 
02:31:29.700 --> 02:31:33.050 align:start position:0%
advance is probably just a pipe dream
yes

02:31:33.050 --> 02:31:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:34.849 --> 02:31:34.859 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
02:31:36.650 --> 02:31:36.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
02:31:38.570 --> 02:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
Dolan for taking my question it's along
 
02:31:41.389 --> 02:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
the same lines as I listened to my
 
02:31:43.990 --> 02:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
colleague representative Harrington
 
02:31:47.330 --> 02:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
asking about whether this is the correct
 
02:31:49.929 --> 02:31:49.939 align:start position:0%
response to what we're trying to solve
 
02:31:53.270 --> 02:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot about the six-month
 
02:31:55.250 --> 02:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
lock-in of rates being you know the
 
02:31:57.530 --> 02:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
contributor to the problem that they
 
02:31:59.150 --> 02:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
were being passed along even though they
 
02:32:01.070 --> 02:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
might not have been staying in place
 
02:32:03.230 --> 02:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
that long so
 
02:32:05.630 --> 02:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
um we've talked a little bit here about
 
02:32:08.030 --> 02:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
laddering some folks do laddering all
 
02:32:09.650 --> 02:32:09.660 align:start position:0%
right none of us are really experts on
 
02:32:12.889 --> 02:32:12.899 align:start position:0%
all of the how all that works but could
 
02:32:15.010 --> 02:32:15.020 align:start position:0%
you comment on whether you think the
 
02:32:17.990 --> 02:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
20-year Contracting is actually
 
02:32:19.790 --> 02:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
something that would address that
 
02:32:21.170 --> 02:32:21.180 align:start position:0%
particular concern because it seems like
 
02:32:23.330 --> 02:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
that's what this is in response to sure
 
02:32:25.309 --> 02:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
so um you sign into one of your contract
 
02:32:26.330 --> 02:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
you're certainly going to get price
 
02:32:26.340 --> 02:32:27.410 align:start position:0%
you're certainly going to get price
stability

02:32:27.410 --> 02:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
stability
 
02:32:30.170 --> 02:32:30.180 align:start position:0%
the question is at what level right
 
02:32:32.030 --> 02:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
because particularly given the
 
02:32:33.710 --> 02:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
experience that we are seeing in some of
 
02:32:36.410 --> 02:32:36.420 align:start position:0%
the Southern New England states around
 
02:32:37.849 --> 02:32:37.859 align:start position:0%
um some of those contracts now being out
 
02:32:40.370 --> 02:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
of the money for for the supplier
 
02:32:43.790 --> 02:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
well if I were them uh I would then be
 
02:32:46.730 --> 02:32:46.740 align:start position:0%
building in a higher uh a risk premium
 
02:32:48.889 --> 02:32:48.899 align:start position:0%
within those contracts for for that
 
02:32:51.650 --> 02:32:51.660 align:start position:0%
similar situation moving forward
 
02:32:55.130 --> 02:32:55.140 align:start position:0%
um there is certainly a uh a level at a
 
02:32:56.870 --> 02:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
supplier is going to be willing to to
 
02:32:59.870 --> 02:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
lock and give a fixed price but the the
 
02:33:03.410 --> 02:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
buyer is going to to Bear a a healthy
 
02:33:04.670 --> 02:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
risk premium
 
02:33:06.250 --> 02:33:06.260 align:start position:0%
um within that
 
02:33:10.309 --> 02:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
I also think part of this is
 
02:33:12.830 --> 02:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
um uh the the way that the market is set
 
02:33:15.950 --> 02:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
up in in New Hampshire is to provide the
 
02:33:18.349 --> 02:33:18.359 align:start position:0%
option for the consumer particularly
 
02:33:19.849 --> 02:33:19.859 align:start position:0%
some of the the larger business
 
02:33:22.429 --> 02:33:22.439 align:start position:0%
consumers and the larger users the
 
02:33:25.370 --> 02:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
capability to go out and and negotiate
 
02:33:27.469 --> 02:33:27.479 align:start position:0%
whatever term of a deal that they they
 
02:33:29.929 --> 02:33:29.939 align:start position:0%
want if they do want a longer term
 
02:33:33.050 --> 02:33:33.060 align:start position:0%
contract in the retail Market there are
 
02:33:35.090 --> 02:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
much longer terms than just a a
 
02:33:37.250 --> 02:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
six-month strip available
 
02:33:37.260 --> 02:33:37.870 align:start position:0%
six-month strip available
um

02:33:37.870 --> 02:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:40.870 --> 02:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
these types of decades-long
 
02:33:42.770 --> 02:33:42.780 align:start position:0%
non-by-passable charge types of
 
02:33:45.710 --> 02:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
contracts I I I think are very very
 
02:33:45.720 --> 02:33:46.910 align:start position:0%
contracts I I I think are very very
risky

02:33:46.910 --> 02:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
risky
 
02:33:49.730 --> 02:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
um overall
 
02:33:49.740 --> 02:33:51.889 align:start position:0%
um overall
follow-up

02:33:51.889 --> 02:33:51.899 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:33:54.110 --> 02:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
speaks to that as well
 
02:33:56.570 --> 02:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
um as you were speaking the other uh
 
02:33:58.490 --> 02:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
thought that I had was from looking at
 
02:34:00.290 --> 02:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
the letters that yourself and Miss
 
02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
Connors had submitted to us in terms of
 
02:34:05.570 --> 02:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
an effect on the wholesale Market which
 
02:34:07.550 --> 02:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
I would like to better understand so if
 
02:34:10.370 --> 02:34:10.380 align:start position:0%
you could maybe segue and well
 
02:34:12.469 --> 02:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to follow up on what um Dan
 
02:34:14.030 --> 02:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
said in response to your first question
 
02:34:15.770 --> 02:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
and then I'll pass that over um back to
 
02:34:18.830 --> 02:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
Dan so yes you yes regarding price
 
02:34:21.290 --> 02:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
stability you can by taking that much of
 
02:34:23.510 --> 02:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
the of the supply or demand out of the
 
02:34:25.610 --> 02:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
market you do lock people in and that
 
02:34:26.750 --> 02:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
gives you
 
02:34:28.610 --> 02:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
um the stability but to Dan's point you
 
02:34:28.620 --> 02:34:29.450 align:start position:0%
um the stability but to Dan's point you
know

02:34:29.450 --> 02:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:34:31.309 --> 02:34:31.319 align:start position:0%
um you're liking yourself usually into a
 
02:34:32.809 --> 02:34:32.819 align:start position:0%
higher you're almost always locking
 
02:34:34.309 --> 02:34:34.319 align:start position:0%
yourself into a higher cost for the
 
02:34:36.710 --> 02:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
consumers and just as a point of example
 
02:34:38.750 --> 02:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
Avon grid signed a contract in
 
02:34:41.570 --> 02:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in Spring of 2022 that was
 
02:34:43.969 --> 02:34:43.979 align:start position:0%
a 20-year contract with a 2.5 percent
 
02:34:46.730 --> 02:34:46.740 align:start position:0%
increase every year so that in year 20
 
02:34:49.550 --> 02:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
they were going to be receiving 95.28
 
02:34:51.770 --> 02:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
per megawatt hour and even under those
 
02:34:53.330 --> 02:34:53.340 align:start position:0%
circumstances Avon grid is trying to
 
02:34:54.889 --> 02:34:54.899 align:start position:0%
reopen that contract
 
02:34:56.750 --> 02:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
saying it's not enough to bring to the
 
02:34:56.760 --> 02:34:58.969 align:start position:0%
saying it's not enough to bring to the
markets

02:34:58.969 --> 02:34:58.979 align:start position:0%
markets
 
02:35:01.670 --> 02:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
and on the the wholesale Market impact
 
02:35:04.190 --> 02:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
um it's pretty straightforward so
 
02:35:07.490 --> 02:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
um by let's say it's 20 to use round
 
02:35:09.230 --> 02:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
numbers one-fifth of the market is under
 
02:35:11.030 --> 02:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
these contracts
 
02:35:13.610 --> 02:35:13.620 align:start position:0%
um functionally speaking those resources
 
02:35:15.710 --> 02:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
still have to get dispatched by ISO
 
02:35:17.570 --> 02:35:17.580 align:start position:0%
newing on ISO New England is the air
 
02:35:20.990 --> 02:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
traffic controller of the grid overall
 
02:35:24.170 --> 02:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
to do that those resources then get
 
02:35:25.969 --> 02:35:25.979 align:start position:0%
entered into that energy Market that
 
02:35:28.550 --> 02:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
clears every day in 15-minute increments
 
02:35:30.889 --> 02:35:30.899 align:start position:0%
as a price taker so they they have to
 
02:35:34.610 --> 02:35:34.620 align:start position:0%
offer in at effectively zero dollars and
 
02:35:37.670 --> 02:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
what that then means is that portion of
 
02:35:39.530 --> 02:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
the electricity Market is
 
02:35:42.950 --> 02:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
carved out and then means that the the
 
02:35:44.510 --> 02:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
clearing price the price any other
 
02:35:47.870 --> 02:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
resources would get would get reduced
 
02:35:49.790 --> 02:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
because now you have
 
02:35:52.130 --> 02:35:52.140 align:start position:0%
um a substantial portion of of that
 
02:35:53.929 --> 02:35:53.939 align:start position:0%
market that that has disappeared and it
 
02:35:56.929 --> 02:35:56.939 align:start position:0%
just moves back the supply stack
 
02:35:59.389 --> 02:35:59.399 align:start position:0%
um what strikes me is that one of the
 
02:36:01.790 --> 02:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
other justifications for for this type
 
02:36:03.590 --> 02:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
of a policy shift is concern about
 
02:36:06.349 --> 02:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
retirement of some of the the larger
 
02:36:08.750 --> 02:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
scale resources it is those very
 
02:36:10.849 --> 02:36:10.859 align:start position:0%
resources that are also then going to
 
02:36:13.130 --> 02:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
see their economics further undermined
 
02:36:15.770 --> 02:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
by this and we just kind of perpetuate
 
02:36:18.469 --> 02:36:18.479 align:start position:0%
this this cycle moving forward and have
 
02:36:20.750 --> 02:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
the perverse outcome of actually further
 
02:36:24.530 --> 02:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
accelerating the revenue degradation for
 
02:36:26.809 --> 02:36:26.819 align:start position:0%
a number of those facilities with the
 
02:36:29.090 --> 02:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
very real potential of driving more
 
02:36:31.190 --> 02:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
retirements and at a certain point than
 
02:36:34.790 --> 02:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
it's the subsidy beget subsidy now this
 
02:36:36.830 --> 02:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
person needs a bailout and and so on and
 
02:36:38.210 --> 02:36:38.220 align:start position:0%
so forth
 
02:36:40.849 --> 02:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
thank you okay additional questions from
 
02:36:42.889 --> 02:36:42.899 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:36:44.990 --> 02:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
seeing that let's move on thank you I'd
 
02:36:46.849 --> 02:36:46.859 align:start position:0%
like to call on Sam Evans Brown of clean
 
02:36:48.590 --> 02:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
energy New Hampshire to give us his
 
02:37:00.410 --> 02:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:02.150 --> 02:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
02:37:02.160 --> 02:37:03.410 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
committee

02:37:03.410 --> 02:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:37:03.420 --> 02:37:04.730 align:start position:0%
committee
um

02:37:04.730 --> 02:37:04.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:06.830 --> 02:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
I think maybe I would just like to take
 
02:37:10.550 --> 02:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
a beat uh and talk about what uh how we
 
02:37:12.830 --> 02:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
got the markets that we have today and
 
02:37:15.230 --> 02:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
and how markets generally are changing
 
02:37:17.450 --> 02:37:17.460 align:start position:0%
all around the world
 
02:37:17.460 --> 02:37:19.690 align:start position:0%
all around the world
um

02:37:19.690 --> 02:37:19.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:22.190 --> 02:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
Seabrook station was mentioned earlier
 
02:37:23.870 --> 02:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
and I think Seabrook station is a
 
02:37:25.490 --> 02:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
perfect example of how we wound up in
 
02:37:27.889 --> 02:37:27.899 align:start position:0%
the situation where we are now utilities
 
02:37:30.469 --> 02:37:30.479 align:start position:0%
when they were tasked with building and
 
02:37:32.990 --> 02:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
operating the Our Generation Fleet had
 
02:37:35.870 --> 02:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
very very little incentive to exert cost
 
02:37:37.610 --> 02:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
discipline when it came to developing
 
02:37:39.110 --> 02:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
new projects because they knew that they
 
02:37:40.730 --> 02:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
were going to be able to get their
 
02:37:42.590 --> 02:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
regulated rate of return on any Capital
 
02:37:47.090 --> 02:37:47.100 align:start position:0%
that expended this uh has a a documented
 
02:37:49.309 --> 02:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
a very well documented history of
 
02:37:51.710 --> 02:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
leading to cost overruns that then rate
 
02:37:54.290 --> 02:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
payers are saddled with that is what led
 
02:37:56.030 --> 02:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
to deregulation I mean that was that was
 
02:37:57.830 --> 02:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
really the the
 
02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
um the the problem that we were solving
 
02:38:02.389 --> 02:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
for is how to exert cost discipline when
 
02:38:05.210 --> 02:38:05.220 align:start position:0%
it comes to regulated utilities
 
02:38:07.130 --> 02:38:07.140 align:start position:0%
um it started with Margaret Thatcher in
 
02:38:09.770 --> 02:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
the UK 1990 was the first country to to
 
02:38:12.650 --> 02:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
engage in deregulation and that in that
 
02:38:14.510 --> 02:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
regard our markets have worked extremely
 
02:38:17.630 --> 02:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
well and I think that they're a model of
 
02:38:20.389 --> 02:38:20.399 align:start position:0%
of how you can use Market forces to to
 
02:38:22.730 --> 02:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
even in an area that we thought was a
 
02:38:24.889 --> 02:38:24.899 align:start position:0%
natural monopoly to exert cost
 
02:38:24.899 --> 02:38:26.510 align:start position:0%
natural monopoly to exert cost
discipline

02:38:26.510 --> 02:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
discipline
 
02:38:28.070 --> 02:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
um however I think we have to recognize
 
02:38:30.590 --> 02:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
that our electricity markets are not a
 
02:38:34.190 --> 02:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
you know perfect uh uh you know
 
02:38:36.170 --> 02:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
frictionless Market of the type that
 
02:38:37.849 --> 02:38:37.859 align:start position:0%
Frederick Hayek would recognize right
 
02:38:40.490 --> 02:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
these are highly regulated they are
 
02:38:43.190 --> 02:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
highly intervened upon they they are
 
02:38:45.230 --> 02:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
they're a a they're meant to be sort of
 
02:38:48.469 --> 02:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
a financial replica of a physical system
 
02:38:50.750 --> 02:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
um and that is ensuring you know
 
02:38:53.030 --> 02:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
economically efficient dispatch of of
 
02:38:54.950 --> 02:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
whatever the lowest cost resource at the
 
02:38:56.389 --> 02:38:56.399 align:start position:0%
moment is
 
02:38:59.090 --> 02:38:59.100 align:start position:0%
they they have while they have done a
 
02:39:01.190 --> 02:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
good job of Shifting risk from uh rate
 
02:39:03.230 --> 02:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
payers to developers what they don't
 
02:39:05.809 --> 02:39:05.819 align:start position:0%
necessarily contemplate is what are the
 
02:39:07.490 --> 02:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
drivers of cost on the electric grid
 
02:39:09.770 --> 02:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
apart from the cost overruns that that
 
02:39:11.630 --> 02:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
we experienced through the 70s 80s and
 
02:39:14.330 --> 02:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
90s and one of the drivers of cost on
 
02:39:16.610 --> 02:39:16.620 align:start position:0%
the electric system is cost of capital
 
02:39:18.410 --> 02:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
cost of capital especially when it comes
 
02:39:20.450 --> 02:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
to any Capital intensive generation
 
02:39:22.010 --> 02:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
asset which will include renewable
 
02:39:24.889 --> 02:39:24.899 align:start position:0%
assets but also assets like nuclear can
 
02:39:27.070 --> 02:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
be a substantial
 
02:39:27.080 --> 02:39:28.610 align:start position:0%
be a substantial
substantial

02:39:28.610 --> 02:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
02:39:30.950 --> 02:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
element of the cost of the energy that
 
02:39:33.050 --> 02:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
you ultimately receive when it comes to
 
02:39:34.670 --> 02:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
renewable energy plants that can be as
 
02:39:36.410 --> 02:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
much as 50 percent of the cost of energy
 
02:39:38.870 --> 02:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
is just what is the interest rate on the
 
02:39:40.550 --> 02:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
on you the the you know the package of
 
02:39:42.830 --> 02:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
equity and and debt that is paying for
 
02:39:44.330 --> 02:39:44.340 align:start position:0%
the project
 
02:39:46.370 --> 02:39:46.380 align:start position:0%
um and it is because of that recognition
 
02:39:49.730 --> 02:39:49.740 align:start position:0%
that many countries have have all around
 
02:39:52.010 --> 02:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
the world moved towards competitive
 
02:39:55.370 --> 02:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
solicitations of new resources as a new
 
02:39:57.770 --> 02:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
market design and there's been a lot of
 
02:39:59.389 --> 02:39:59.399 align:start position:0%
talk about this as a sort of government
 
02:40:01.849 --> 02:40:01.859 align:start position:0%
intervention as if we're not already
 
02:40:03.530 --> 02:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
creating and designing the markets that
 
02:40:05.210 --> 02:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
are are supplying our electricity today
 
02:40:08.389 --> 02:40:08.399 align:start position:0%
this is simply a different Market design
 
02:40:10.550 --> 02:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's a competitive auction a competitive
 
02:40:12.530 --> 02:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
process by which we select the lowest
 
02:40:15.050 --> 02:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
cost resource for new construction
 
02:40:17.030 --> 02:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
um and I will note that you know we
 
02:40:18.469 --> 02:40:18.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned Margaret Thatcher the United
 
02:40:19.849 --> 02:40:19.859 align:start position:0%
Kingdom is doing these types of
 
02:40:21.590 --> 02:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
competitive solicitations
 
02:40:25.550 --> 02:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
so while I understand that this is new
 
02:40:27.530 --> 02:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of discomfort with
 
02:40:29.809 --> 02:40:29.819 align:start position:0%
with doing new things it's also worth
 
02:40:31.969 --> 02:40:31.979 align:start position:0%
pointing out that
 
02:40:34.490 --> 02:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
uh we are in the midst of a dramatic
 
02:40:36.110 --> 02:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
transformation of the Energy System writ
 
02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
large with new technologies that have
 
02:40:40.670 --> 02:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
new capital structures and and notably
 
02:40:42.950 --> 02:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
zero fuel costs and they're bidding into
 
02:40:44.929 --> 02:40:44.939 align:start position:0%
markets that are designed with for
 
02:40:47.090 --> 02:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
entities that had fuel costs and had
 
02:40:49.429 --> 02:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
much lower Capital requirements and
 
02:40:51.590 --> 02:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps it is it is worth taking a look
 
02:40:54.349 --> 02:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
at the idea that that we do need new
 
02:40:56.750 --> 02:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
market designs in order to confront that
 
02:40:58.849 --> 02:40:58.859 align:start position:0%
that reality
 
02:41:01.969 --> 02:41:01.979 align:start position:0%
um I I would point out the two ppas that
 
02:41:03.469 --> 02:41:03.479 align:start position:0%
were mentioned well excuse me the two
 
02:41:04.969 --> 02:41:04.979 align:start position:0%
generation assets that were mentioned
 
02:41:08.389 --> 02:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
Burgess and Seabrook both were projects
 
02:41:11.450 --> 02:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
that yes we were signed into a long-term
 
02:41:13.370 --> 02:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
contract but there was no competitive
 
02:41:15.349 --> 02:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
process to determine which power plant
 
02:41:16.969 --> 02:41:16.979 align:start position:0%
was going to get built in either in
 
02:41:19.010 --> 02:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
either instance there was a single
 
02:41:20.809 --> 02:41:20.819 align:start position:0%
project that was considered we locked
 
02:41:22.849 --> 02:41:22.859 align:start position:0%
into a long-term uh well in the case of
 
02:41:25.429 --> 02:41:25.439 align:start position:0%
Seabrook locked into paying that as a
 
02:41:28.370 --> 02:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
stranded cost under a previous regime of
 
02:41:30.770 --> 02:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
regulation in the case of Burgess it was
 
02:41:32.330 --> 02:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
just the plant that we were offer word
 
02:41:33.770 --> 02:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're talking about here
 
02:41:34.849 --> 02:41:34.859 align:start position:0%
we're talking about running a
 
02:41:36.590 --> 02:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
competitive process and selecting the
 
02:41:38.510 --> 02:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
lowest cost Resource as a way of
 
02:41:41.929 --> 02:41:41.939 align:start position:0%
incentivizing new generation so I'll
 
02:41:44.690 --> 02:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
leave it there but I I thought I just we
 
02:41:48.050 --> 02:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
could bring the camera out a little bit
 
02:41:54.290 --> 02:41:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:57.230 --> 02:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki has one thank you
 
02:41:59.389 --> 02:41:59.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Mr Brown
 
02:42:02.510 --> 02:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
um having been through the ice storm and
 
02:42:04.250 --> 02:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
numerous other things living in a rural
 
02:42:06.770 --> 02:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
area it does seem like our default as
 
02:42:06.780 --> 02:42:08.170 align:start position:0%
area it does seem like our default as
gasoline

02:42:08.170 --> 02:42:08.180 align:start position:0%
gasoline
 
02:42:12.770 --> 02:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
and other than nuclear and fossil fuel
 
02:42:15.830 --> 02:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
what can what technologies can possibly
 
02:42:18.170 --> 02:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
take us through a serious winter outage
 
02:42:20.270 --> 02:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to last for days
 
02:42:22.010 --> 02:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
uh well so if we're talking about
 
02:42:23.929 --> 02:42:23.939 align:start position:0%
outages I'm not sure that this bill is
 
02:42:26.270 --> 02:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
is speaking to how we ensure ensure that
 
02:42:27.950 --> 02:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
the poles and wires stay up in an ice
 
02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:28.790 align:start position:0%
the poles and wires stay up in an ice
storm

02:42:28.790 --> 02:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
storm
 
02:42:31.070 --> 02:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
um I I would argue you know when we look
 
02:42:33.170 --> 02:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
at what happened on Christmas Eve and
 
02:42:36.410 --> 02:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
why and why prices went uh wild the way
 
02:42:38.030 --> 02:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
that they did it was it was a number of
 
02:42:39.530 --> 02:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
generators that were tripping offline
 
02:42:41.809 --> 02:42:41.819 align:start position:0%
because of operational issues associated
 
02:42:44.090 --> 02:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
with with the storm and with the with
 
02:42:47.270 --> 02:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
the cold but that said uh I don't think
 
02:42:50.150 --> 02:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
that this bill would would uh ensure
 
02:42:52.070 --> 02:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
that we have backup power at our homes
 
02:42:55.849 --> 02:42:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:58.370 --> 02:42:58.380 align:start position:0%
you need a follow-up
 
02:43:01.010 --> 02:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
well it the same thing goes for backup
 
02:43:04.250 --> 02:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
power for the grid if
 
02:43:07.610 --> 02:43:07.620 align:start position:0%
um you know right generating capacity is
 
02:43:10.730 --> 02:43:10.740 align:start position:0%
not there you know extended out a time
 
02:43:12.950 --> 02:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
frame in the winter then where does the
 
02:43:14.929 --> 02:43:14.939 align:start position:0%
power come from yeah no so so I think
 
02:43:16.550 --> 02:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
the question maybe maybe I'll try to
 
02:43:17.809 --> 02:43:17.819 align:start position:0%
reframe the question you can tell me if
 
02:43:19.250 --> 02:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
I'm getting to what you're asking which
 
02:43:21.410 --> 02:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
is that what is a resource that would
 
02:43:23.090 --> 02:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
help deal with our winter reliability
 
02:43:25.309 --> 02:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
problem right and I and Mr Dolan
 
02:43:27.110 --> 02:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
addressed that a bit and I I guess I
 
02:43:29.330 --> 02:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
would disagree slightly in that
 
02:43:30.889 --> 02:43:30.899 align:start position:0%
um when you look at what's in the iso
 
02:43:33.230 --> 02:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
New England interconnection queue the
 
02:43:34.730 --> 02:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
resource that is at most heavily
 
02:43:37.370 --> 02:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
represented is storage and and I would
 
02:43:39.830 --> 02:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
anticipate that that some combination of
 
02:43:42.170 --> 02:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
of new renewable resources and storage
 
02:43:44.750 --> 02:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
likely are the way that we that we start
 
02:43:46.969 --> 02:43:46.979 align:start position:0%
to nibble at this at this problem but
 
02:43:49.490 --> 02:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
but you know just to again return to
 
02:43:50.809 --> 02:43:50.819 align:start position:0%
First principles the reason we have a
 
02:43:52.010 --> 02:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
winter reliability problem in New
 
02:43:54.050 --> 02:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
England is a very hard problem to solve
 
02:43:57.050 --> 02:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
uh and and the profile of our region is
 
02:43:59.750 --> 02:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
such that that there are very few
 
02:44:01.969 --> 02:44:01.979 align:start position:0%
resources that can be that can be relied
 
02:44:04.130 --> 02:44:04.140 align:start position:0%
upon and why we really need to think
 
02:44:07.070 --> 02:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
about building new things
 
02:44:09.830 --> 02:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
02:44:11.630 --> 02:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you again
 
02:44:15.230 --> 02:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
for being here I'm going to rephrase a
 
02:44:16.490 --> 02:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
question I had asked to the
 
02:44:17.809 --> 02:44:17.819 align:start position:0%
representatives from the Department of
 
02:44:20.870 --> 02:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
energy earlier in this in this new
 
02:44:23.030 --> 02:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
energy Market that you that you've
 
02:44:23.040 --> 02:44:24.830 align:start position:0%
energy Market that you that you've
described

02:44:24.830 --> 02:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
described
 
02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:25.730 align:start position:0%
described
um

02:44:25.730 --> 02:44:25.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:28.370 --> 02:44:28.380 align:start position:0%
where we clearly need more we need more
 
02:44:30.250 --> 02:44:30.260 align:start position:0%
more energy
 
02:44:34.730 --> 02:44:34.740 align:start position:0%
is or are what are essentially Legacy
 
02:44:37.250 --> 02:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
distribution companies the right place
 
02:44:38.889 --> 02:44:38.899 align:start position:0%
where we should be
 
02:44:41.750 --> 02:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
encouraging this kind of new development
 
02:44:44.450 --> 02:44:44.460 align:start position:0%
or are there other entities that
 
02:44:46.790 --> 02:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
are more appropriate this is a great
 
02:44:46.800 --> 02:44:47.929 align:start position:0%
are more appropriate this is a great
question

02:44:47.929 --> 02:44:47.939 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:44:50.570 --> 02:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
um and and uh it may indeed be the case
 
02:44:53.090 --> 02:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
that other entities are should be the
 
02:44:55.429 --> 02:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
the ones that serve as the anchor
 
02:44:57.410 --> 02:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
contract that gets the low-cost
 
02:44:59.450 --> 02:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
financing that I was referring to in
 
02:45:01.730 --> 02:45:01.740 align:start position:0%
particular I think uh Community power is
 
02:45:03.410 --> 02:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
is something that's on the horizon that
 
02:45:05.630 --> 02:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
could very well serve that purpose it's
 
02:45:07.730 --> 02:45:07.740 align:start position:0%
really a question of of sort of risk and
 
02:45:09.710 --> 02:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
credit rating is is what it really comes
 
02:45:12.650 --> 02:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
down to and and the the trouble I see
 
02:45:15.170 --> 02:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
right now is that when you look around
 
02:45:17.870 --> 02:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
for who is a credit worthy counterparty
 
02:45:20.090 --> 02:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
that would that a that a financer would
 
02:45:22.610 --> 02:45:22.620 align:start position:0%
see as very low risk
 
02:45:24.830 --> 02:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
um there's there aren't a ton of options
 
02:45:26.809 --> 02:45:26.819 align:start position:0%
and the utilities the utilities are the
 
02:45:29.270 --> 02:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
option that we have right now
 
02:45:31.190 --> 02:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
um and you know I will note that there's
 
02:45:32.570 --> 02:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
an enormous amount of renewable energy
 
02:45:33.950 --> 02:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
being developed in the region right now
 
02:45:36.950 --> 02:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
where the the credit worthy counterparty
 
02:45:38.990 --> 02:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
are large corporations um you know
 
02:45:40.670 --> 02:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
Comcast just announced that they're
 
02:45:43.910 --> 02:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
they're taking a long-term PPA from a
 
02:45:46.610 --> 02:45:46.620 align:start position:0%
solar project being developed I believe
 
02:45:47.870 --> 02:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire I might be
 
02:45:49.969 --> 02:45:49.979 align:start position:0%
speaking out a turn there but but that
 
02:45:52.250 --> 02:45:52.260 align:start position:0%
that is that is a an Avenue for
 
02:45:54.590 --> 02:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
developing renewable energy as we speak
 
02:45:56.630 --> 02:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
um that is being accessed as we speak I
 
02:45:58.429 --> 02:45:58.439 align:start position:0%
would just say that uh the bill that you
 
02:46:00.650 --> 02:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
have it before you is a is a way to
 
02:46:02.870 --> 02:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
ensure that not only large businesses
 
02:46:05.150 --> 02:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
are able to capitalize on those on that
 
02:46:07.610 --> 02:46:07.620 align:start position:0%
that hedge and potentially those rate
 
02:46:10.130 --> 02:46:10.140 align:start position:0%
savings that uh those types of companies
 
02:46:13.730 --> 02:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:16.010 --> 02:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
okay representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
02:46:18.889 --> 02:46:18.899 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:46:20.510 --> 02:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
you for being here and taking my
 
02:46:20.520 --> 02:46:21.670 align:start position:0%
you for being here and taking my
question

02:46:21.670 --> 02:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:46:24.410 --> 02:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
your point three on your your written
 
02:46:26.170 --> 02:46:26.180 align:start position:0%
testimony about
 
02:46:29.450 --> 02:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
prioritizing New Hampshire jobs that's a
 
02:46:31.309 --> 02:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
that's a really good point that I hadn't
 
02:46:34.070 --> 02:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
even considered is it possible that we
 
02:46:36.050 --> 02:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
could partner with an out-of-state
 
02:46:38.389 --> 02:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
company and then all of our resources
 
02:46:39.410 --> 02:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
could go
 
02:46:42.110 --> 02:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
to their jobs which is why you you put
 
02:46:44.510 --> 02:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
that in there yeah so so I guess the the
 
02:46:46.490 --> 02:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
reason that I suggested that that is a
 
02:46:47.510 --> 02:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
change that clean energy New Hampshire
 
02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
would be very supportive of is because
 
02:46:51.410 --> 02:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
if you can imagine that we issue an RFP
 
02:46:53.950 --> 02:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
that says we want the lowest cost energy
 
02:46:56.210 --> 02:46:56.220 align:start position:0%
and we want it to benefit winter
 
02:46:58.190 --> 02:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
reliability and those essentially are
 
02:46:59.750 --> 02:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
the two main criteria that we're
 
02:47:01.610 --> 02:47:01.620 align:start position:0%
evaluating the proposals on what happens
 
02:47:04.550 --> 02:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
if you get one proposal from say a
 
02:47:07.550 --> 02:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
project in northern Maine that is in a
 
02:47:08.630 --> 02:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
really you know it's a really great
 
02:47:10.130 --> 02:47:10.140 align:start position:0%
resource and it's very competitive in
 
02:47:11.570 --> 02:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
that regard but has a lot of
 
02:47:13.309 --> 02:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
transmission to get it down to get it
 
02:47:14.270 --> 02:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
down to New Hampshire and you have to
 
02:47:16.010 --> 02:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
pay those transmission fees versus
 
02:47:17.750 --> 02:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
something in New Hampshire that's ever
 
02:47:20.330 --> 02:47:20.340 align:start position:0%
so slightly more expensive but there's
 
02:47:22.130 --> 02:47:22.140 align:start position:0%
all of the economic development benefit
 
02:47:24.710 --> 02:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
of having chosen that contract under the
 
02:47:27.349 --> 02:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
existing language I'm not certain that
 
02:47:29.210 --> 02:47:29.220 align:start position:0%
that folks putting in their proposals
 
02:47:30.770 --> 02:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
would be able to make the argument that
 
02:47:32.630 --> 02:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
their project should be chosen based on
 
02:47:34.670 --> 02:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
that economic Economic Development
 
02:47:38.270 --> 02:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:41.270 --> 02:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
02:47:43.190 --> 02:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:47:46.190 --> 02:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
um Sam I I liked this bill a lot better
 
02:47:49.730 --> 02:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
when it was in the Senate and it was
 
02:47:53.170 --> 02:47:53.180 align:start position:0%
aimed you know laser focused on
 
02:47:56.090 --> 02:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
incentivizing renewable development and
 
02:47:58.490 --> 02:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
you know because it recognized the
 
02:48:00.650 --> 02:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
conundrum or you know the situation you
 
02:48:01.910 --> 02:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
point out in your testimony about
 
02:48:04.370 --> 02:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
Capital costs being a much higher
 
02:48:08.150 --> 02:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
fraction of overall cost do you
 
02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:09.110 align:start position:0%
fraction of overall cost do you
um

02:48:09.110 --> 02:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:13.250 --> 02:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
do you see danger in in the fact that
 
02:48:15.230 --> 02:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
you know I understand the principles of
 
02:48:19.250 --> 02:48:19.260 align:start position:0%
fuel neutrality but do you think it's
 
02:48:22.969 --> 02:48:22.979 align:start position:0%
dangerous that in sort of leveling the
 
02:48:25.550 --> 02:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
playing field so to speak in this
 
02:48:27.530 --> 02:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
um version of the bill
 
02:48:29.690 --> 02:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
that we are
 
02:48:32.690 --> 02:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
um risking the kind of dangers that the
 
02:48:34.910 --> 02:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
the power generators Association spoke
 
02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:37.670 align:start position:0%
the power generators Association spoke
to

02:48:37.670 --> 02:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:41.270 --> 02:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
so uh for the record I did not write the
 
02:48:42.469 --> 02:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
amendment that you have in front of you
 
02:48:44.389 --> 02:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
and and if if I had written it it would
 
02:48:46.910 --> 02:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
it would likely be somewhat different
 
02:48:48.230 --> 02:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
um the reason that clean energy hamster
 
02:48:49.370 --> 02:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
is comfortable supporting this
 
02:48:51.349 --> 02:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
legislation is is that again if you look
 
02:48:52.969 --> 02:48:52.979 align:start position:0%
at the iso New England interconnection
 
02:48:52.979 --> 02:48:54.050 align:start position:0%
at the iso New England interconnection
queue

02:48:54.050 --> 02:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
queue
 
02:48:55.490 --> 02:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
um I used to say that it was 95
 
02:48:58.130 --> 02:48:58.140 align:start position:0%
renewable energy and batteries uh but
 
02:48:59.690 --> 02:48:59.700 align:start position:0%
then we got an update at the iso New
 
02:49:01.130 --> 02:49:01.140 align:start position:0%
England consumer liaison group and we're
 
02:49:04.010 --> 02:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
now up to 98 uh renewable energy and
 
02:49:05.270 --> 02:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
batteries that are that are the projects
 
02:49:07.130 --> 02:49:07.140 align:start position:0%
that are being proposed on the Queue my
 
02:49:08.270 --> 02:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is that there's a single
 
02:49:10.190 --> 02:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
natural gas plant being proposed in in
 
02:49:12.050 --> 02:49:12.060 align:start position:0%
Peabody Massachusetts and that's the
 
02:49:13.490 --> 02:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
only fossil resource that folks have put
 
02:49:15.830 --> 02:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
in uh so as such the fact that this is
 
02:49:17.929 --> 02:49:17.939 align:start position:0%
for new resources only
 
02:49:19.429 --> 02:49:19.439 align:start position:0%
um you know again it's not the bill that
 
02:49:22.010 --> 02:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
I would have written but but it's it it
 
02:49:23.570 --> 02:49:23.580 align:start position:0%
makes me substantially more comfortable
 
02:49:26.090 --> 02:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
with with supporting it
 
02:49:28.910 --> 02:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
um now that said uh there's a number
 
02:49:30.830 --> 02:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
there's a number of like who knows how
 
02:49:33.349 --> 02:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
this will go uh so so everything that's
 
02:49:35.990 --> 02:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
in this bill is is sort of
 
02:49:38.630 --> 02:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
um voluntary right so the the contracts
 
02:49:41.030 --> 02:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
can be up to 20 years
 
02:49:43.730 --> 02:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
um and and that so that it may be that
 
02:49:47.330 --> 02:49:47.340 align:start position:0%
that uh that I will be surprised
 
02:49:49.610 --> 02:49:49.620 align:start position:0%
um and and that that we will see fossil
 
02:49:51.290 --> 02:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
resources bidding into this
 
02:49:53.210 --> 02:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
um in a very competitive way I I guess
 
02:49:55.670 --> 02:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
I'm I just struggle to understand how a
 
02:49:57.950 --> 02:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
resource that has a variable fuel cost
 
02:50:02.870 --> 02:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
can uh can put in a a price that is that
 
02:50:05.450 --> 02:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
is stable and and know that they'll make
 
02:50:06.710 --> 02:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
their money back
 
02:50:09.230 --> 02:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
um and and so again that's that's where
 
02:50:10.550 --> 02:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
a modicum of my comfort with this bill
 
02:50:12.530 --> 02:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
02:50:15.230 --> 02:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
02:50:16.969 --> 02:50:16.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Ling for taking my
 
02:50:17.990 --> 02:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
question I have a question and a
 
02:50:19.130 --> 02:50:19.140 align:start position:0%
clarification let's start with the
 
02:50:21.530 --> 02:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
clarification you gave an example of a
 
02:50:23.389 --> 02:50:23.399 align:start position:0%
project up in Maine and it would be
 
02:50:25.130 --> 02:50:25.140 align:start position:0%
transmission costs associated with that
 
02:50:28.610 --> 02:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
but looking on page uh I guess it's one
 
02:50:30.889 --> 02:50:30.899 align:start position:0%
of the bill it says any costs associated
 
02:50:32.330 --> 02:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
with transmission system upgrades
 
02:50:33.889 --> 02:50:33.899 align:start position:0%
required for interconnecting new or
 
02:50:35.389 --> 02:50:35.399 align:start position:0%
incremental electric sources shall be
 
02:50:37.309 --> 02:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
included in responses to the proposals
 
02:50:39.050 --> 02:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
so there would be no addition that would
 
02:50:41.270 --> 02:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
be part of the price already included
 
02:50:43.429 --> 02:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
right and and so so I was simply
 
02:50:44.690 --> 02:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
throwing it out there because maybe
 
02:50:46.130 --> 02:50:46.140 align:start position:0%
you've got something that's got a better
 
02:50:48.170 --> 02:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
resource but a longer transmission path
 
02:50:49.969 --> 02:50:49.979 align:start position:0%
and you know as perhaps giving too many
 
02:50:51.950 --> 02:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
details now my question if I follow up
 
02:50:55.010 --> 02:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
uh in your letter on the last it's the
 
02:50:57.830 --> 02:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
last page uh in your bullet two I'm
 
02:50:59.270 --> 02:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
trying to figure this out a little bit
 
02:51:02.150 --> 02:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
you say you talk about how this could
 
02:51:02.160 --> 02:51:03.170 align:start position:0%
you say you talk about how this could
affect

02:51:03.170 --> 02:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
affect
 
02:51:03.180 --> 02:51:04.070 align:start position:0%
affect
um

02:51:04.070 --> 02:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:05.750 --> 02:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
Community power Market which I
 
02:51:07.670 --> 02:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
understand because there's a
 
02:51:09.349 --> 02:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
non-bypassable charge that they could
 
02:51:11.870 --> 02:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
face if the electricity was sold into
 
02:51:14.750 --> 02:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
the market but then you say uh we
 
02:51:16.130 --> 02:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
believe it's best by addressing this by
 
02:51:18.110 --> 02:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
assisting the utility shall reconcile
 
02:51:19.670 --> 02:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
the cost of these contracts through
 
02:51:23.690 --> 02:51:23.700 align:start position:0%
distribution rates which is on page 313
 
02:51:26.630 --> 02:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
and I don't I just don't understand how
 
02:51:28.670 --> 02:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
that's going to solve the problem if
 
02:51:30.710 --> 02:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
they still can do a non-bypassable
 
02:51:32.870 --> 02:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
charge where someone that has Community
 
02:51:35.150 --> 02:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
power or competitive power supply is
 
02:51:37.429 --> 02:51:37.439 align:start position:0%
going to pay for electricity that they
 
02:51:39.110 --> 02:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
don't have anything to do with
 
02:51:39.120 --> 02:51:40.490 align:start position:0%
don't have anything to do with
so

02:51:40.490 --> 02:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:51:42.590 --> 02:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
um Community power I believe Community
 
02:51:44.330 --> 02:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
power is here and has put in a pink card
 
02:51:46.010 --> 02:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
to testify so so they could speak to
 
02:51:47.929 --> 02:51:47.939 align:start position:0%
this but but my my sort of top level
 
02:51:49.910 --> 02:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
understanding of this is that uh there's
 
02:51:51.710 --> 02:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
a concern that the utilities would be
 
02:51:53.690 --> 02:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
able to sort of Arbitrage back and forth
 
02:51:56.030 --> 02:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
between default recovering the these
 
02:51:57.650 --> 02:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
contracts through default service or
 
02:51:59.450 --> 02:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
non-by-passable charge depending on what
 
02:52:01.550 --> 02:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
the market conditions are unless that
 
02:52:03.769 --> 02:52:03.779 align:start position:0%
that may becomes a show
 
02:52:06.050 --> 02:52:06.060 align:start position:0%
um if that may becomes a shell it this
 
02:52:08.150 --> 02:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
just becomes a policy decision that the
 
02:52:10.190 --> 02:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
state has made that all rate payers are
 
02:52:10.200 --> 02:52:11.450 align:start position:0%
state has made that all rate payers are
are

02:52:11.450 --> 02:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:52:13.969 --> 02:52:13.979 align:start position:0%
um you know stuck with more or less be
 
02:52:16.309 --> 02:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
it in the money or out of the money
 
02:52:19.550 --> 02:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
um and uh and there's not a concern that
 
02:52:21.830 --> 02:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
the utilities would use it sort of
 
02:52:23.870 --> 02:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
preferentially to to compete against
 
02:52:29.809 --> 02:52:29.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:31.309 --> 02:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
um since you already asked a couple of
 
02:52:33.950 --> 02:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
questions is it okay if we move on or is
 
02:52:37.010 --> 02:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:37.020 --> 02:52:38.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:52:38.510 --> 02:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:52:40.790 --> 02:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
see no more questions for Mr Sam Evans
 
02:52:44.330 --> 02:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
Brown I will move on next to
 
02:52:47.330 --> 02:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
Mr Henry Herndon from the community
 
02:52:50.090 --> 02:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
power Coalition of New Hampshire
 
02:52:56.349 --> 02:52:56.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:58.809 --> 02:52:58.819 align:start position:0%
and the community power Coalition
 
02:53:02.030 --> 02:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
opposes this bill so we'll be interested
 
02:53:04.309 --> 02:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
to understand why thank you
 
02:53:07.190 --> 02:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you committee
 
02:53:07.200 --> 02:53:07.849 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you committee
um

02:53:07.849 --> 02:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:09.950 --> 02:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
I'm Henry Herndon I'm here on behalf of
 
02:53:11.269 --> 02:53:11.279 align:start position:0%
the community power Coalition of New
 
02:53:13.790 --> 02:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh board chair of the
 
02:53:15.349 --> 02:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
Coalition Clifton below sends his
 
02:53:18.290 --> 02:53:18.300 align:start position:0%
regrets but he has a written two paid
 
02:53:20.630 --> 02:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
more one page front and back
 
02:53:22.429 --> 02:53:22.439 align:start position:0%
um testimony that has been circulated to
 
02:53:24.769 --> 02:53:24.779 align:start position:0%
the committee so I'll keep my comments
 
02:53:26.990 --> 02:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
brief I think many of the the points
 
02:53:28.610 --> 02:53:28.620 align:start position:0%
that I hopes to raise have already been
 
02:53:30.230 --> 02:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
addressed I know it's a long day for the
 
02:53:30.240 --> 02:53:31.610 align:start position:0%
addressed I know it's a long day for the
committee

02:53:31.610 --> 02:53:31.620 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:53:33.950 --> 02:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
um but yes the the community power
 
02:53:36.230 --> 02:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
Coalition of New Hampshire opposes this
 
02:53:38.809 --> 02:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
bill this is a joint Powers agency of uh
 
02:53:41.510 --> 02:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
34 cities towns and counties that have
 
02:53:43.790 --> 02:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
joined together to make use of the
 
02:53:45.290 --> 02:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
community power legislation and access
 
02:53:47.570 --> 02:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
the competitive market to achieve I
 
02:53:49.370 --> 02:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
think many of the objectives that are
 
02:53:51.950 --> 02:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
put forth uh in this bill
 
02:53:53.269 --> 02:53:53.279 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think there's necessarily
 
02:53:55.309 --> 02:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
a disagreement on we want to effectively
 
02:53:57.650 --> 02:53:57.660 align:start position:0%
lower electricity costs but there's a
 
02:53:59.389 --> 02:53:59.399 align:start position:0%
disagreement on what is the the best way
 
02:54:01.190 --> 02:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
02:54:03.230 --> 02:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:54:04.910 --> 02:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll just reiterate really quickly
 
02:54:06.170 --> 02:54:06.180 align:start position:0%
and then take committee's question the
 
02:54:08.150 --> 02:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
committee's questions but um
 
02:54:10.190 --> 02:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
you know this really is a coin flip for
 
02:54:11.809 --> 02:54:11.819 align:start position:0%
the next 20 years of whether or not
 
02:54:12.950 --> 02:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
there will be benefits and there's
 
02:54:15.230 --> 02:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
uncertainty to the degree to what those
 
02:54:18.590 --> 02:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
benefits would be they are unknowable
 
02:54:20.809 --> 02:54:20.819 align:start position:0%
um and there is potential for a massive
 
02:54:22.849 --> 02:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
cost shift onto competitive market
 
02:54:25.070 --> 02:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
actors so folks who shop for competitive
 
02:54:26.630 --> 02:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
Supply and this was addressed by
 
02:54:28.670 --> 02:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington and others and
 
02:54:29.870 --> 02:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
folks who are on the community power
 
02:54:31.610 --> 02:54:31.620 align:start position:0%
would pay for the cost of these assets
 
02:54:33.530 --> 02:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
through a non-by-passable charge in the
 
02:54:35.090 --> 02:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
increase in distribution rates to the
 
02:54:36.410 --> 02:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
extent that they're
 
02:54:38.630 --> 02:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
um they are charged as described in the
 
02:54:40.429 --> 02:54:40.439 align:start position:0%
legislation and that is the primary
 
02:54:42.889 --> 02:54:42.899 align:start position:0%
reason for the coalition's objection to
 
02:54:45.050 --> 02:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
02:54:45.060 --> 02:54:45.590 align:start position:0%
this legislation
um

02:54:45.590 --> 02:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:45.600 --> 02:54:47.269 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:54:47.269 --> 02:54:47.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:54:49.250 --> 02:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
I'll just sort of note
 
02:54:51.530 --> 02:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
um you know the the concerns are valid
 
02:54:53.150 --> 02:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
but again the gentleman from the New
 
02:54:55.969 --> 02:54:55.979 align:start position:0%
England power generators Association uh
 
02:54:58.490 --> 02:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
really articulated this well
 
02:54:58.500 --> 02:54:59.630 align:start position:0%
really articulated this well
um

02:54:59.630 --> 02:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:03.230 --> 02:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
we are at this uh particular moment in
 
02:55:05.570 --> 02:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
the market where we were coming out of a
 
02:55:07.910 --> 02:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
particularly high cost event uh for
 
02:55:10.250 --> 02:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
utility default Supply and I would
 
02:55:12.110 --> 02:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee not to sort of
 
02:55:14.750 --> 02:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
lose our lose our heads and because of
 
02:55:17.809 --> 02:55:17.819 align:start position:0%
that brief uh event uh make a change it
 
02:55:19.309 --> 02:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
would dramatically affect the New
 
02:55:21.230 --> 02:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's competitive Electric market
 
02:55:23.570 --> 02:55:23.580 align:start position:0%
for 20 years to come
 
02:55:25.849 --> 02:55:25.859 align:start position:0%
um and I think that there are ways that
 
02:55:28.429 --> 02:55:28.439 align:start position:0%
we can as the gentleman over here
 
02:55:31.490 --> 02:55:31.500 align:start position:0%
actually suggested incentivize Market
 
02:55:34.370 --> 02:55:34.380 align:start position:0%
actors to do this exact thing uh the
 
02:55:35.269 --> 02:55:35.279 align:start position:0%
gentleman from clean energy New
 
02:55:37.490 --> 02:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire alluded to this as well we can
 
02:55:40.370 --> 02:55:40.380 align:start position:0%
create Market mechanisms to incentivize
 
02:55:42.769 --> 02:55:42.779 align:start position:0%
the development of new generation
 
02:55:44.510 --> 02:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
resources in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:55:47.450 --> 02:55:47.460 align:start position:0%
that achieve this purpose Without Really
 
02:55:49.670 --> 02:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know giving a blank check to
 
02:55:51.290 --> 02:55:51.300 align:start position:0%
Monopoly utilities to to enter into
 
02:55:54.469 --> 02:55:54.479 align:start position:0%
these long-term contracts so I would I
 
02:55:55.670 --> 02:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
would encourage the committee to really
 
02:55:58.190 --> 02:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
look hard at how do we find market-based
 
02:55:59.990 --> 02:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
solutions to do this exact thing to
 
02:56:01.690 --> 02:56:01.700 align:start position:0%
achieve this exact thing
 
02:56:05.269 --> 02:56:05.279 align:start position:0%
without sort of reintroducing the the
 
02:56:07.190 --> 02:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
monopolization of the con the supply
 
02:56:07.200 --> 02:56:08.990 align:start position:0%
monopolization of the con the supply
Marketplace

02:56:08.990 --> 02:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
Marketplace
 
02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:10.070 align:start position:0%
Marketplace
um

02:56:10.070 --> 02:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:12.050 --> 02:56:12.060 align:start position:0%
and yeah with that I'll close my
 
02:56:13.250 --> 02:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
comments and I'll take any questions if
 
02:56:15.290 --> 02:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
there are any thank you
 
02:56:17.510 --> 02:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you questions for the
 
02:56:19.910 --> 02:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee representative munz has one
 
02:56:22.070 --> 02:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for coming
 
02:56:23.389 --> 02:56:23.399 align:start position:0%
in here
 
02:56:25.969 --> 02:56:25.979 align:start position:0%
um can you can you share any thoughts
 
02:56:27.230 --> 02:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
you might have about some of those
 
02:56:28.790 --> 02:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
market-based solutions that would
 
02:56:31.070 --> 02:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
encourage development
 
02:56:31.080 --> 02:56:32.570 align:start position:0%
encourage development
yes

02:56:32.570 --> 02:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:56:34.690 --> 02:56:34.700 align:start position:0%
um I think there's a particular
 
02:56:38.570 --> 02:56:38.580 align:start position:0%
opportunity at the sort of intrastate
 
02:56:40.969 --> 02:56:40.979 align:start position:0%
wholesale level the one to five megawatt
 
02:56:40.979 --> 02:56:42.290 align:start position:0%
wholesale level the one to five megawatt
level

02:56:42.290 --> 02:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:56:43.790 --> 02:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
um and I know this isn't a hearing on
 
02:56:45.769 --> 02:56:45.779 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 166 but that was discussed
 
02:56:47.150 --> 02:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
last week I understand there's a work
 
02:56:49.849 --> 02:56:49.859 align:start position:0%
session this afternoon uh and there may
 
02:56:51.950 --> 02:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
be some amendments or creative ways to
 
02:56:54.889 --> 02:56:54.899 align:start position:0%
improve that bill uh that could achieve
 
02:56:57.230 --> 02:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
exactly this to basically allow Market
 
02:57:00.710 --> 02:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
actors to develop projects that reduce
 
02:57:02.870 --> 02:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
certain elements of the cost stack
 
02:57:04.910 --> 02:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
transmission costs capacity costs other
 
02:57:07.309 --> 02:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
wholesale costs and you allow the Public
 
02:57:09.550 --> 02:57:09.560 align:start position:0%
Utility Commission to
 
02:57:12.950 --> 02:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
calculate that value and then create a
 
02:57:15.230 --> 02:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
fair Level Playing Field where utilities
 
02:57:17.030 --> 02:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
could propose projects that lower those
 
02:57:19.250 --> 02:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
costs Market actors could propose
 
02:57:21.349 --> 02:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
projects that lower those costs and now
 
02:57:23.630 --> 02:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
we have sort of robust local marketplace
 
02:57:25.610 --> 02:57:25.620 align:start position:0%
where folks are developing new resources
 
02:57:27.230 --> 02:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
which I think is the intent of this bill
 
02:57:28.790 --> 02:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
but they're doing it under a market
 
02:57:30.830 --> 02:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
structure as opposed to
 
02:57:33.290 --> 02:57:33.300 align:start position:0%
um the this approach
 
02:57:35.690 --> 02:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
02:57:38.570 --> 02:57:38.580 align:start position:0%
are there are there any do you have it
 
02:57:40.309 --> 02:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
do you are there any
 
02:57:42.650 --> 02:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
um limitations that you have right now
 
02:57:45.769 --> 02:57:45.779 align:start position:0%
that are preventing your organization
 
02:57:47.870 --> 02:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
and other community power organizations
 
02:57:47.880 --> 02:57:49.309 align:start position:0%
and other community power organizations
from

02:57:49.309 --> 02:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:57:51.950 --> 02:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
encouraging new development and is there
 
02:57:54.410 --> 02:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
anything that we should be doing to
 
02:57:57.590 --> 02:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
enable you to to do that let's keep our
 
02:57:59.750 --> 02:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
questions confined to the subject of the
 
02:58:03.230 --> 02:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
bill okay fine thank you
 
02:58:05.389 --> 02:58:05.399 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
02:58:07.429 --> 02:58:07.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
02:58:09.710 --> 02:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
Herndon for taking my question
 
02:58:12.110 --> 02:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
um my thoughts are were along the line
 
02:58:12.120 --> 02:58:13.790 align:start position:0%
um my thoughts are were along the line
of

02:58:13.790 --> 02:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:58:15.710 --> 02:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
the recent testimony yours and the one
 
02:58:18.290 --> 02:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
that preceded you bring to mind growing
 
02:58:21.050 --> 02:58:21.060 align:start position:0%
pains right the the point was brought up
 
02:58:22.790 --> 02:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
that we're in a transition and so people
 
02:58:24.650 --> 02:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
are trying to figure out do we do things
 
02:58:26.269 --> 02:58:26.279 align:start position:0%
the way we've always done them do we
 
02:58:28.730 --> 02:58:28.740 align:start position:0%
borrow things from other states
 
02:58:31.130 --> 02:58:31.140 align:start position:0%
um and so I I wonder if you could
 
02:58:34.070 --> 02:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
comment on the fact uh of maybe where
 
02:58:36.650 --> 02:58:36.660 align:start position:0%
the community power Coalition is at this
 
02:58:37.969 --> 02:58:37.979 align:start position:0%
point in time because I think we just
 
02:58:40.910 --> 02:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
enabled that and I feel like maybe in
 
02:58:42.650 --> 02:58:42.660 align:start position:0%
some ways this would be pulling the rug
 
02:58:44.389 --> 02:58:44.399 align:start position:0%
out from under
 
02:58:46.309 --> 02:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
um the point that they're at in terms of
 
02:58:47.929 --> 02:58:47.939 align:start position:0%
moving forward to figure out what the
 
02:58:50.150 --> 02:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
price signals are in the market
 
02:58:52.250 --> 02:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
in a sense yes it would be it would be
 
02:58:55.309 --> 02:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
at least introducing an unfairness or an
 
02:58:56.870 --> 02:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
imbalance in the market
 
02:58:59.870 --> 02:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
um that would limit the the ability of
 
02:59:01.910 --> 02:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
competitive actors like the coalition to
 
02:59:04.550 --> 02:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
to fully deliver benefits and you know
 
02:59:07.370 --> 02:59:07.380 align:start position:0%
we talk about who has the the uh
 
02:59:09.530 --> 02:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
the ability to finance these types of
 
02:59:11.389 --> 02:59:11.399 align:start position:0%
projects and today Community power
 
02:59:12.830 --> 02:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
Coalition may not be able to do that
 
02:59:14.690 --> 02:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
today but
 
02:59:17.750 --> 02:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
um you know we have the policies in the
 
02:59:21.230 --> 02:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
business uh structure in place to very
 
02:59:22.790 --> 02:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
quickly over the next few years develop
 
02:59:24.650 --> 02:59:24.660 align:start position:0%
our financial reserves register as a
 
02:59:27.110 --> 02:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
market participant with ISO New England
 
02:59:30.010 --> 02:59:30.020 align:start position:0%
um and then be be sort of financially
 
02:59:32.809 --> 02:59:32.819 align:start position:0%
sufficient to finance those at low cost
 
02:59:35.269 --> 02:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
ourselves so we this is one example of
 
02:59:37.250 --> 02:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
them of a market actor that could do
 
02:59:40.790 --> 02:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
that in a few short years and um so I
 
02:59:44.050 --> 02:59:44.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:46.130 --> 02:59:46.140 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question
 
02:59:48.110 --> 02:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and uh thank you for
 
02:59:50.630 --> 02:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
coming in today and taking my question
 
02:59:50.640 --> 02:59:51.590 align:start position:0%
coming in today and taking my question
um

02:59:51.590 --> 02:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:54.590 --> 02:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
we've had discussion about the the shift
 
02:59:56.389 --> 02:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
in the marketplace and the transition to
 
02:59:58.670 --> 02:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
a new uh Market design and
 
03:00:02.330 --> 03:00:02.340 align:start position:0%
the need to decarbonize our electricity
 
03:00:05.570 --> 03:00:05.580 align:start position:0%
system and so the bill that we have in
 
03:00:07.309 --> 03:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
front of us is contemplating a fairly
 
03:00:09.769 --> 03:00:09.779 align:start position:0%
ambitious shift to you know one-fifth of
 
03:00:11.870 --> 03:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
the entire load
 
03:00:14.150 --> 03:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
um and I understand that that has
 
03:00:16.429 --> 03:00:16.439 align:start position:0%
impacts obviously on all the players in
 
03:00:19.309 --> 03:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
the market uh including your your type
 
03:00:22.250 --> 03:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
of organization but um do you excuse me
 
03:00:25.010 --> 03:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
could you move a little closer yeah do
 
03:00:28.370 --> 03:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
you have any idea what uh percentage you
 
03:00:30.050 --> 03:00:30.060 align:start position:0%
know going out 10 years from now what
 
03:00:31.389 --> 03:00:31.399 align:start position:0%
percentage of
 
03:00:33.710 --> 03:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
generating capacity Community power
 
03:00:36.349 --> 03:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
structures could provide and would that
 
03:00:38.450 --> 03:00:38.460 align:start position:0%
be anything akin to what we're looking
 
03:00:40.250 --> 03:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
at here which is you know one-fifth of
 
03:00:42.830 --> 03:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
the load I cannot say that for a
 
03:00:45.050 --> 03:00:45.060 align:start position:0%
certainty um and that is in part because
 
03:00:46.969 --> 03:00:46.979 align:start position:0%
the objective of the Coalition is not
 
03:00:48.710 --> 03:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
explicitly to develop a certain kind of
 
03:00:51.050 --> 03:00:51.060 align:start position:0%
resource it is to serve the objectives
 
03:00:53.210 --> 03:00:53.220 align:start position:0%
of its member cities and towns some of
 
03:00:54.889 --> 03:00:54.899 align:start position:0%
those cities and towns have very strong
 
03:00:57.290 --> 03:00:57.300 align:start position:0%
renewable energy goals
 
03:00:59.510 --> 03:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of them that do so
 
03:01:01.250 --> 03:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
for those towns the Coalition can meet
 
03:01:02.870 --> 03:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
those needs by Contracting with
 
03:01:04.790 --> 03:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
renewable sources and to this extent
 
03:01:06.290 --> 03:01:06.300 align:start position:0%
that it is cost effective we'll do that
 
03:01:08.269 --> 03:01:08.279 align:start position:0%
for the portfolio as a whole so we are
 
03:01:10.490 --> 03:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
looking at that holistically I can't say
 
03:01:12.650 --> 03:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
specifically right now at what point the
 
03:01:14.870 --> 03:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
coalition's portfolio will be what
 
03:01:19.610 --> 03:01:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:22.010 --> 03:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
okay see no further questions from the
 
03:01:24.410 --> 03:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
committee we'll move along only five
 
03:01:27.230 --> 03:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
speakers stand between us and lunch and
 
03:01:28.790 --> 03:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
the next of those speakers will be
 
03:01:31.309 --> 03:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
Kristen Koch from the business and
 
03:01:47.929 --> 03:01:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:50.510 --> 03:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
good morning and welcome
 
03:01:52.550 --> 03:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and members of the
 
03:01:55.070 --> 03:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
committee is it still morning it's a
 
03:01:56.630 --> 03:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be here today
 
03:01:58.429 --> 03:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
um Kirsten Koch representing the
 
03:02:00.290 --> 03:02:00.300 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association also
 
03:02:01.790 --> 03:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
known as Bia
 
03:02:04.550 --> 03:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
we are here today in support of Senate
 
03:02:07.550 --> 03:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
Bill 54 Granite State businesses
 
03:02:09.769 --> 03:02:09.779 align:start position:0%
desperately need relief from high energy
 
03:02:11.929 --> 03:02:11.939 align:start position:0%
costs and we believe that at this time
 
03:02:13.670 --> 03:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should be using every tool
 
03:02:15.710 --> 03:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
in its toolbox to lower the cost of
 
03:02:15.720 --> 03:02:16.630 align:start position:0%
in its toolbox to lower the cost of
energy

03:02:16.630 --> 03:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
energy
 
03:02:19.670 --> 03:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 54 is a market-driven energy
 
03:02:21.830 --> 03:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
procurement process that prioritizes
 
03:02:24.110 --> 03:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
cost savings and reliability in an
 
03:02:26.210 --> 03:02:26.220 align:start position:0%
Innovative way to increase in-state
 
03:02:28.190 --> 03:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
energy production in a manner that would
 
03:02:31.969 --> 03:02:31.979 align:start position:0%
lower energy costs for rate pairs we
 
03:02:33.469 --> 03:02:33.479 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill is perhaps the
 
03:02:35.090 --> 03:02:35.100 align:start position:0%
only Bill remaining this session that
 
03:02:37.130 --> 03:02:37.140 align:start position:0%
proactively seeks to lower energy costs
 
03:02:39.110 --> 03:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
for ratepayers so we think it's
 
03:02:41.170 --> 03:02:41.180 align:start position:0%
significant for the legislation
 
03:02:44.330 --> 03:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
legislature to take action on this bill
 
03:02:47.030 --> 03:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
I want to note that Senate Bill 54 as
 
03:02:49.910 --> 03:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
amended has bipartisan support and is
 
03:02:52.550 --> 03:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
the product of input from a variety of
 
03:02:55.150 --> 03:02:55.160 align:start position:0%
key stakeholders we've worked
 
03:02:58.190 --> 03:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
pain-sakenly to get input from a variety
 
03:03:00.469 --> 03:03:00.479 align:start position:0%
of folks working together on this
 
03:03:03.950 --> 03:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
compromise and we're really proud of of
 
03:03:05.690 --> 03:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
the variety of stakeholders that have
 
03:03:07.610 --> 03:03:07.620 align:start position:0%
come together to make this work and who
 
03:03:09.230 --> 03:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
are looking for a solution for New
 
03:03:09.240 --> 03:03:11.030 align:start position:0%
are looking for a solution for New
Hampshire

03:03:11.030 --> 03:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:03:13.070 --> 03:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
um it's essential to us that the primary
 
03:03:14.929 --> 03:03:14.939 align:start position:0%
benefit and outcome achieved here
 
03:03:17.870 --> 03:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
through this process is lowering energy
 
03:03:19.730 --> 03:03:19.740 align:start position:0%
costs and providing benefits for rate
 
03:03:21.769 --> 03:03:21.779 align:start position:0%
Pairs and although it comes with a
 
03:03:23.750 --> 03:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
multitude of benefits including Economic
 
03:03:25.790 --> 03:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
Development potential local tax revenue
 
03:03:28.429 --> 03:03:28.439 align:start position:0%
and environmental benefits we see this
 
03:03:31.610 --> 03:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
bill as having the proper safeguards to
 
03:03:35.510 --> 03:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:37.790 --> 03:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
um I do want to comment on some of the
 
03:03:40.570 --> 03:03:40.580 align:start position:0%
changes that Sam Evans Brown proposed
 
03:03:42.950 --> 03:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
were in support of those we we think
 
03:03:44.090 --> 03:03:44.100 align:start position:0%
it's important to have that local
 
03:03:45.590 --> 03:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
benefit Edition
 
03:03:47.150 --> 03:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
um to to keep those projects and jobs
 
03:03:49.969 --> 03:03:49.979 align:start position:0%
here we're also supportive of changes
 
03:03:53.290 --> 03:03:53.300 align:start position:0%
that would require that the utilities
 
03:03:56.389 --> 03:03:56.399 align:start position:0%
instead of May it should say Xiao on
 
03:03:58.450 --> 03:03:58.460 align:start position:0%
page 3 line 13
 
03:04:00.769 --> 03:04:00.779 align:start position:0%
which would require that the utilities
 
03:04:03.110 --> 03:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
shall sell purchase energy and
 
03:04:04.670 --> 03:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
environmental attributes into the
 
03:04:07.010 --> 03:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
wholesale Market in a manner to minimize
 
03:04:09.590 --> 03:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
cost and maximize benefits to rate pairs
 
03:04:12.889 --> 03:04:12.899 align:start position:0%
we see this change as addressing some of
 
03:04:14.389 --> 03:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
the concerns of the competitive
 
03:04:15.889 --> 03:04:15.899 align:start position:0%
generators or the community power
 
03:04:18.530 --> 03:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
Coalition because this would ensure that
 
03:04:20.389 --> 03:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
the manner in which the utilities can
 
03:04:22.370 --> 03:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
sell energy and environmental attributes
 
03:04:24.469 --> 03:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
gained from these projects and contracts
 
03:04:27.230 --> 03:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
will not negatively impact these folks
 
03:04:29.630 --> 03:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
so we do find that that change is
 
03:04:31.550 --> 03:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
important to addressing those concerns
 
03:04:33.429 --> 03:04:33.439 align:start position:0%
but ultimately
 
03:04:36.050 --> 03:04:36.060 align:start position:0%
we were effectively also this committee
 
03:04:38.690 --> 03:04:38.700 align:start position:0%
passed Senate bill 54. it's an
 
03:04:40.730 --> 03:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
Innovative way to lower energy costs and
 
03:04:43.250 --> 03:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
you know there's ample evidence that the
 
03:04:45.410 --> 03:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
current market is not operating and
 
03:04:47.150 --> 03:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
producing outcomes that are cost
 
03:04:49.969 --> 03:04:49.979 align:start position:0%
effective are reliable for ratepayers so
 
03:04:51.230 --> 03:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration I'm
 
03:04:52.969 --> 03:04:52.979 align:start position:0%
happy to try to answer any questions the
 
03:04:54.469 --> 03:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
committee may have
 
03:04:56.690 --> 03:04:56.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions from the
 
03:04:58.670 --> 03:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
committee representative Harrington has
 
03:04:58.680 --> 03:05:00.230 align:start position:0%
committee representative Harrington has
one

03:05:00.230 --> 03:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:05:01.610 --> 03:05:01.620 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:05:03.650 --> 03:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm a little
 
03:05:05.809 --> 03:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
confused because I believe I'm correct
 
03:05:07.910 --> 03:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
in saying that the overwhelming majority
 
03:05:11.210 --> 03:05:11.220 align:start position:0%
of the Bia members buy their power on
 
03:05:12.950 --> 03:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
the competitive market they don't take
 
03:05:15.410 --> 03:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
the fault Service rates so since this
 
03:05:18.410 --> 03:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
would have no effect or extremely little
 
03:05:20.750 --> 03:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
effect on any rates other than default
 
03:05:22.490 --> 03:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
service other than the fact of that
 
03:05:25.010 --> 03:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
non-bypassable charge that people take
 
03:05:27.050 --> 03:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
competitive rates would now have to
 
03:05:30.590 --> 03:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
could pay why you think it's going to
 
03:05:33.170 --> 03:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
lower rates for people that don't take
 
03:05:34.490 --> 03:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
the fault service
 
03:05:35.809 --> 03:05:35.819 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
 
03:05:37.790 --> 03:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
representative and I think maybe there's
 
03:05:40.250 --> 03:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
a misunderstanding some of our large
 
03:05:42.410 --> 03:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
manufacturers do use competitive Supply
 
03:05:44.929 --> 03:05:44.939 align:start position:0%
but not entirely and we have a variety
 
03:05:47.530 --> 03:05:47.540 align:start position:0%
of members of large and small businesses
 
03:05:50.510 --> 03:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
who this does affect I mean it's not a
 
03:05:51.830 --> 03:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
majority of our members are not on
 
03:05:53.510 --> 03:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
competitive Supply and it is important
 
03:05:55.550 --> 03:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
to them to lower energy costs we hear
 
03:05:57.290 --> 03:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
from you know members who are small
 
03:05:58.429 --> 03:05:58.439 align:start position:0%
businesses members who have
 
03:06:00.290 --> 03:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
manufacturing just in New Hampshire
 
03:06:02.630 --> 03:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
those smaller businesses this is really
 
03:06:05.110 --> 03:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
important to change for them
 
03:06:07.849 --> 03:06:07.859 align:start position:0%
follow up but there's nothing for those
 
03:06:09.650 --> 03:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
members that choose to take default
 
03:06:11.929 --> 03:06:11.939 align:start position:0%
Service rates from switching to a
 
03:06:13.490 --> 03:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
competitive supplier and is there
 
03:06:15.469 --> 03:06:15.479 align:start position:0%
anything that you know of because some
 
03:06:18.910 --> 03:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
of these uh business uh members of your
 
03:06:21.650 --> 03:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
organization may be power suppliers that
 
03:06:23.450 --> 03:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
nothing prevents these power suppliers
 
03:06:25.070 --> 03:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
from entering in long-term contracts
 
03:06:29.150 --> 03:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
with competitive suppliers is there
 
03:06:30.590 --> 03:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
I don't believe there's anything
 
03:06:32.269 --> 03:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
stopping them from doing competitive
 
03:06:33.710 --> 03:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
Supply but this just provides an
 
03:06:33.720 --> 03:06:36.230 align:start position:0%
Supply but this just provides an
alternative

03:06:36.230 --> 03:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:37.969 --> 03:06:37.979 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative
 
03:06:39.950 --> 03:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
Reynolds has one
 
03:06:41.929 --> 03:06:41.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh thank you
 
03:06:43.910 --> 03:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
Miss Koch for being here I'm intrigued
 
03:06:47.210 --> 03:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
by your suggestion that uh if I heard
 
03:06:49.130 --> 03:06:49.140 align:start position:0%
you correctly you
 
03:06:51.889 --> 03:06:51.899 align:start position:0%
suggested that in on the very last page
 
03:06:54.530 --> 03:06:54.540 align:start position:0%
of the bill section four that rather
 
03:06:54.540 --> 03:06:56.630 align:start position:0%
of the bill section four that rather
than

03:06:56.630 --> 03:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
than
 
03:06:58.490 --> 03:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
um allowing
 
03:07:01.130 --> 03:07:01.140 align:start position:0%
the inve the utilities
 
03:07:03.769 --> 03:07:03.779 align:start position:0%
to sell
 
03:07:06.110 --> 03:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
the purchase energy sell the the product
 
03:07:08.630 --> 03:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
of these pbas rather than just allowing
 
03:07:09.889 --> 03:07:09.899 align:start position:0%
them to sell it into the wholesale
 
03:07:11.990 --> 03:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
Market that they shall sell it into the
 
03:07:13.490 --> 03:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
whole team Market which seems like it
 
03:07:16.630 --> 03:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
would sort of radically change what this
 
03:07:19.490 --> 03:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
what the
 
03:07:21.230 --> 03:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
well how the bill would work it would it
 
03:07:23.450 --> 03:07:23.460 align:start position:0%
would make the investor own utilities
 
03:07:25.210 --> 03:07:25.220 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
03:07:27.469 --> 03:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
agents of
 
03:07:29.809 --> 03:07:29.819 align:start position:0%
Contracting for a lot for new new
 
03:07:31.910 --> 03:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
long-term energy resources
 
03:07:33.349 --> 03:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
and I guess
 
03:07:35.809 --> 03:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
um can you expound a little bit more on
 
03:07:38.750 --> 03:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
that recommendation the rationale uh
 
03:07:41.990 --> 03:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
yeah sure and I think that
 
03:07:43.490 --> 03:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question I think
 
03:07:45.230 --> 03:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
there's some folks who are who are
 
03:07:46.910 --> 03:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
better experts who can go into detail on
 
03:07:48.889 --> 03:07:48.899 align:start position:0%
that but our thoughts is that that would
 
03:07:50.570 --> 03:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
alleviate some of the community power
 
03:07:53.690 --> 03:07:53.700 align:start position:0%
Coalition concerns about you know the
 
03:07:55.610 --> 03:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
costs and taking away from their efforts
 
03:07:56.809 --> 03:07:56.819 align:start position:0%
you know we don't want to undermine
 
03:07:58.250 --> 03:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
their efforts that's not the point of
 
03:08:00.170 --> 03:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:08:01.490 --> 03:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:08:04.849 --> 03:08:04.859 align:start position:0%
further questions for Miss Koch
 
03:08:06.830 --> 03:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none we want to thank you for
 
03:08:08.809 --> 03:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
being here to testify and we'll call
 
03:08:11.150 --> 03:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
next on Meredith Hatfield of The Nature
 
03:08:17.030 --> 03:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:22.190 --> 03:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:23.870 --> 03:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Vos members of the
 
03:08:25.309 --> 03:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
committee Meredith Hatfield for the
 
03:08:27.530 --> 03:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
nature conservancy and we unfortunately
 
03:08:30.290 --> 03:08:30.300 align:start position:0%
do oppose this bill as amended by the
 
03:08:32.210 --> 03:08:32.220 align:start position:0%
Senate as much as we very much would
 
03:08:35.269 --> 03:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
like to support it we did support it as
 
03:08:39.290 --> 03:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
introduced for three reasons at that
 
03:08:40.969 --> 03:08:40.979 align:start position:0%
time it was for
 
03:08:44.150 --> 03:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
um clean energy resources only
 
03:08:48.170 --> 03:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
secondly it was very targeted at solving
 
03:08:50.330 --> 03:08:50.340 align:start position:0%
part of the default service price
 
03:08:52.610 --> 03:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
increases that we've seen unfortunately
 
03:08:54.469 --> 03:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
we don't think this version does that
 
03:08:56.809 --> 03:08:56.819 align:start position:0%
and then thirdly
 
03:08:58.790 --> 03:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
um actually very related to the
 
03:09:00.410 --> 03:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
conversation that representative
 
03:09:02.450 --> 03:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
Reynolds was just having about the
 
03:09:04.550 --> 03:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
non-by-passable charge
 
03:09:08.570 --> 03:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
um we're concerned that the utilities
 
03:09:10.670 --> 03:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
would take advantage of that language on
 
03:09:13.610 --> 03:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
page three that's currently May
 
03:09:13.620 --> 03:09:14.269 align:start position:0%
page three that's currently May
um

03:09:14.269 --> 03:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:16.610 --> 03:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
to resell the power which is exactly
 
03:09:18.650 --> 03:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
what's happening with Berlin biomass
 
03:09:20.510 --> 03:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
plant right now which is going to strain
 
03:09:24.410 --> 03:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
at costs for customers so we don't
 
03:09:27.110 --> 03:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
support the bill as amended and we think
 
03:09:30.050 --> 03:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
that if as some prior speakers have
 
03:09:30.060 --> 03:09:31.790 align:start position:0%
that if as some prior speakers have
testified

03:09:31.790 --> 03:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
testified
 
03:09:34.670 --> 03:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
that you want this to absolutely result
 
03:09:37.790 --> 03:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
in the lowest cost and to result in
 
03:09:39.889 --> 03:09:39.899 align:start position:0%
price suppression then those words
 
03:09:42.769 --> 03:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
should be in the bill so in this section
 
03:09:47.330 --> 03:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
of the bill that directs the puc what it
 
03:09:49.429 --> 03:09:49.439 align:start position:0%
should look at in its review so this is
 
03:09:49.439 --> 03:09:50.450 align:start position:0%
should look at in its review so this is
um

03:09:50.450 --> 03:09:50.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:52.730 --> 03:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
starting right on line one on page three
 
03:09:57.170 --> 03:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
we do have the words cost effective
 
03:10:00.410 --> 03:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
but if you want lowest price and you
 
03:10:02.570 --> 03:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
want price oppression it probably would
 
03:10:04.730 --> 03:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
be more clear direction to the puc to
 
03:10:05.870 --> 03:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
put those
 
03:10:08.990 --> 03:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
um those actual words right in the bill
 
03:10:11.349 --> 03:10:11.359 align:start position:0%
and then I would just I also wanted to
 
03:10:13.550 --> 03:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
remind you which I'm sure you remember
 
03:10:16.969 --> 03:10:16.979 align:start position:0%
that you retained House Bill 159 which
 
03:10:19.429 --> 03:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
is a much more targeted Bill looking at
 
03:10:21.849 --> 03:10:21.859 align:start position:0%
how to address the default service
 
03:10:25.370 --> 03:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
prices that we've been seeing and I also
 
03:10:27.290 --> 03:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
just wanted to mention the puc does have
 
03:10:29.389 --> 03:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
an open docket looking at that and you
 
03:10:30.830 --> 03:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
all have mentioned you know how
 
03:10:33.590 --> 03:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
complicated this is and that laddering
 
03:10:36.469 --> 03:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
or other approaches might be better
 
03:10:38.990 --> 03:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
um to reduce rates in the short term and
 
03:10:41.210 --> 03:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
and we think those are better that the
 
03:10:43.849 --> 03:10:43.859 align:start position:0%
puc and a bill very targeted on default
 
03:10:46.250 --> 03:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
service might be better ways to address
 
03:10:48.950 --> 03:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
costs uh in the short term
 
03:10:51.410 --> 03:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:10:54.050 --> 03:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Meredith for your
 
03:10:57.710 --> 03:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
testimony do I have any questions here
 
03:10:57.720 --> 03:10:59.030 align:start position:0%
testimony do I have any questions here
representative

03:10:59.030 --> 03:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:11:00.889 --> 03:11:00.899 align:start position:0%
Kaplan your question
 
03:11:04.550 --> 03:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and uh
 
03:11:08.090 --> 03:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
does your organization uh not support
 
03:11:11.150 --> 03:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
the aim of trying to increase the amount
 
03:11:12.889 --> 03:11:12.899 align:start position:0%
of Renewable Power in our generation
 
03:11:16.010 --> 03:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
load and and would you you know would
 
03:11:18.230 --> 03:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
you agree that this bill might go some
 
03:11:19.790 --> 03:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
way towards doing that
 
03:11:21.590 --> 03:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question and and
 
03:11:23.330 --> 03:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
that's actually why we supported the
 
03:11:27.230 --> 03:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
original version which was an amendment
 
03:11:30.410 --> 03:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
um to the RPS law itself so that it was
 
03:11:33.410 --> 03:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
very targeted to try to increase the
 
03:11:35.630 --> 03:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
amount of renewable energy that would be
 
03:11:37.670 --> 03:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
cited in New Hampshire and would be used
 
03:11:39.650 --> 03:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
by New Hampshire customers
 
03:11:43.370 --> 03:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
um this bill could result in
 
03:11:46.550 --> 03:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
um us benefiting from new Renewables and
 
03:11:48.950 --> 03:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
as Sam Evans Brown pointed out most of
 
03:11:52.309 --> 03:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
the iso Q is Renewables but
 
03:11:54.530 --> 03:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
um because of the way it's structured it
 
03:11:57.889 --> 03:11:57.899 align:start position:0%
it quite likely won't reduce costs and
 
03:12:00.050 --> 03:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
could increase stranded costs so we we
 
03:12:07.190 --> 03:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:09.590 --> 03:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you so
 
03:12:11.750 --> 03:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony always a
 
03:12:12.950 --> 03:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
pleasure to see you
 
03:12:15.650 --> 03:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to call on Lindsay
 
03:12:15.660 --> 03:12:18.830 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to call on Lindsay
burgnoring

03:12:18.830 --> 03:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:26.450 --> 03:12:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:27.769 --> 03:12:27.779 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:12:29.330 --> 03:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
thank you chair Thomas again Lindsey
 
03:12:31.670 --> 03:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
Bruin from revision energy
 
03:12:32.990 --> 03:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
um as members of clean energy New
 
03:12:34.790 --> 03:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we Echo their testimony and we
 
03:12:37.130 --> 03:12:37.140 align:start position:0%
are here today in support of the bill
 
03:12:39.950 --> 03:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
um we would respectfully like to add um
 
03:12:41.690 --> 03:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
just a note and a caution that given the
 
03:12:44.150 --> 03:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
size of the aggregate annual cap
 
03:12:45.590 --> 03:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
um within this bill utilities will
 
03:12:47.330 --> 03:12:47.340 align:start position:0%
likely be encouraged to favor sizable
 
03:12:49.130 --> 03:12:49.140 align:start position:0%
resources that may not deliver the
 
03:12:51.889 --> 03:12:51.899 align:start position:0%
benefits of added clean energy or local
 
03:12:53.330 --> 03:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
investment rate here in New Hampshire as
 
03:12:55.130 --> 03:12:55.140 align:start position:0%
you've heard a few speakers
 
03:12:58.010 --> 03:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
um speak to procuring large-scale hydro
 
03:13:00.170 --> 03:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
or offshore wind would surely have both
 
03:13:01.790 --> 03:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
public health and climate mitigation
 
03:13:03.950 --> 03:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
impacts but does little for direct
 
03:13:06.530 --> 03:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
impact on New Hampshire's economy and
 
03:13:08.389 --> 03:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
the creation of local jobs so for that
 
03:13:10.670 --> 03:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
reason we recommend amending the bill to
 
03:13:13.309 --> 03:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
expand criteria to prioritize in-state
 
03:13:14.870 --> 03:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
generation and we would be happy to
 
03:13:17.690 --> 03:13:17.700 align:start position:0%
share sample language in this regard
 
03:13:18.889 --> 03:13:18.899 align:start position:0%
with the committee that could be
 
03:13:21.490 --> 03:13:21.500 align:start position:0%
included in section one and section two
 
03:13:23.690 --> 03:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
and with that I know I'm standing in
 
03:13:25.910 --> 03:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
between you all and sandwiches so I'll
 
03:13:28.370 --> 03:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
leave it there
 
03:13:30.530 --> 03:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
thank you do you have written testimony
 
03:13:32.450 --> 03:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
that you could give us to to summarize
 
03:13:34.429 --> 03:13:34.439 align:start position:0%
that position because I'm like not
 
03:13:35.929 --> 03:13:35.939 align:start position:0%
likely to remember what you said
 
03:13:38.630 --> 03:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh questions from the
 
03:13:40.309 --> 03:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
committee representative Harrington has
 
03:13:42.710 --> 03:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
one uh thank you thank you for taking my
 
03:13:44.690 --> 03:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
question I'm so if I understand what
 
03:13:46.910 --> 03:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
you're saying correctly you think that
 
03:13:49.929 --> 03:13:49.939 align:start position:0%
the rate payers should pay a higher rate
 
03:13:53.389 --> 03:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
uh in order to keep the uh procurement
 
03:13:55.190 --> 03:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh from a plant that's in New Hampshire
 
03:13:57.889 --> 03:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
as compared to being in Maine
 
03:13:59.570 --> 03:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
I think there should be an opportunity
 
03:14:01.790 --> 03:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
for for everything to compete
 
03:14:03.670 --> 03:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
so I would freeze it okay follow-up
 
03:14:05.750 --> 03:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah I'm a little confused
 
03:14:08.210 --> 03:14:08.220 align:start position:0%
okay so I have a plant in in New
 
03:14:10.010 --> 03:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and a proposed plant New
 
03:14:11.750 --> 03:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire proposed plant in Maine they
 
03:14:13.550 --> 03:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
both put in contracts the one in Maine
 
03:14:15.590 --> 03:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
comes in lower you're saying we should
 
03:14:16.790 --> 03:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
give preference to the one in New
 
03:14:19.190 --> 03:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire anyways because it's in New
 
03:14:20.510 --> 03:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire even though it'll cost rate
 
03:14:22.070 --> 03:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
payers more I think there should be
 
03:14:23.750 --> 03:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
consideration language in the bill so
 
03:14:25.550 --> 03:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
that the direct um investment in New
 
03:14:27.230 --> 03:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy could be considered
 
03:14:30.410 --> 03:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
alongside the additional criteria
 
03:14:32.210 --> 03:14:32.220 align:start position:0%
I'd love to see how that would be
 
03:14:34.790 --> 03:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
written out thank you
 
03:14:36.290 --> 03:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
okay further questions from the
 
03:14:36.300 --> 03:14:38.750 align:start position:0%
okay further questions from the
committee

03:14:38.750 --> 03:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:40.190 --> 03:14:40.200 align:start position:0%
seeing that I want to thank you Miss
 
03:14:42.110 --> 03:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
Burgoyne for being here and call next on
 
03:14:43.969 --> 03:14:43.979 align:start position:0%
Michael Licata from eversource to give
 
03:14:46.610 --> 03:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
us his perspective on this proposed
 
03:14:46.620 --> 03:14:49.910 align:start position:0%
us his perspective on this proposed
legislation

03:14:49.910 --> 03:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:53.750 --> 03:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
after Mr locata tells us uh gives us his
 
03:14:55.309 --> 03:14:55.319 align:start position:0%
perspective then we'll have one more
 
03:14:58.429 --> 03:14:58.439 align:start position:0%
speaker and then we'll be done for
 
03:14:58.439 --> 03:14:59.090 align:start position:0%
speaker and then we'll be done for
um

03:14:59.090 --> 03:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:02.210 --> 03:15:02.220 align:start position:0%
the day hopefully on this bill
 
03:15:04.250 --> 03:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
uh for the record Michael Licata
 
03:15:07.070 --> 03:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
eversource energy uh I was worried I was
 
03:15:08.690 --> 03:15:08.700 align:start position:0%
gonna be the last person between you and
 
03:15:09.830 --> 03:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
lunch so
 
03:15:12.050 --> 03:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
happy to hear that there's one more
 
03:15:12.060 --> 03:15:13.250 align:start position:0%
happy to hear that there's one more
um

03:15:13.250 --> 03:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:17.210 --> 03:15:17.220 align:start position:0%
eversource is uh supportive of uh Senate
 
03:15:19.910 --> 03:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 54. I just want to say that we
 
03:15:21.590 --> 03:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
really do appreciate the hard work of
 
03:15:23.570 --> 03:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
the bill sponsor Senator avard Senator
 
03:15:26.570 --> 03:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
Waters uh the Bia and other stakeholders
 
03:15:29.030 --> 03:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
to try to come together and as you can
 
03:15:30.170 --> 03:15:30.180 align:start position:0%
see there's a lot of different
 
03:15:32.990 --> 03:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
perspectives and competing interests to
 
03:15:35.510 --> 03:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
try to thread that needle and present
 
03:15:38.929 --> 03:15:38.939 align:start position:0%
you with a good bill that advances an
 
03:15:42.110 --> 03:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
important public policy priority I just
 
03:15:43.969 --> 03:15:43.979 align:start position:0%
want to walk through just a couple of
 
03:15:47.030 --> 03:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
numbers that I think might be helpful
 
03:15:50.809 --> 03:15:50.819 align:start position:0%
for why this bill is in front of you
 
03:15:52.550 --> 03:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
um and I'll start with a topic that's
 
03:15:56.150 --> 03:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
come up a few times which is uh the
 
03:15:57.530 --> 03:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
issues that were experienced on
 
03:16:00.490 --> 03:16:00.500 align:start position:0%
Christmas Eve uh
 
03:16:02.690 --> 03:16:02.700 align:start position:0%
2816 dollars
 
03:16:06.769 --> 03:16:06.779 align:start position:0%
that was the locational marginal price
 
03:16:10.969 --> 03:16:10.979 align:start position:0%
Peak on Christmas Eve uh per megawatt to
 
03:16:12.889 --> 03:16:12.899 align:start position:0%
put that in perspective right now it's
 
03:16:16.370 --> 03:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
kind of a cool rainy day the LMP for New
 
03:16:19.250 --> 03:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
England is around 35 dollars
 
03:16:21.950 --> 03:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
that was the price that uh the market
 
03:16:24.590 --> 03:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
was producing on Christmas Eve because
 
03:16:27.050 --> 03:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
we did not have enough adequate supply
 
03:16:32.110 --> 03:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
of low-cost reliable sources of energy
 
03:16:34.490 --> 03:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
5000 megawatts
 
03:16:36.950 --> 03:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
that is the number that ISO New England
 
03:16:40.370 --> 03:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
has stated is at risk of retirement in
 
03:16:42.590 --> 03:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
the next year or two
 
03:16:45.349 --> 03:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
five thousand megawatts of Base load
 
03:16:47.570 --> 03:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
power that needs to be replaced in order
 
03:16:50.990 --> 03:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
to continue a reliable Regional energy
 
03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:52.070 align:start position:0%
to continue a reliable Regional energy
grid

03:16:52.070 --> 03:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
grid
 
03:16:54.590 --> 03:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
and I ask you all to consider where that
 
03:16:57.490 --> 03:16:57.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:00.590 --> 03:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
1413. that's the number of megawatts
 
03:17:02.210 --> 03:17:02.220 align:start position:0%
that Mystic station in Everett
 
03:17:04.190 --> 03:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts produces it's a natural
 
03:17:07.670 --> 03:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
gas plant that is only operating because
 
03:17:10.010 --> 03:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
of an out of Market contract a
 
03:17:12.710 --> 03:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
reliability must run contract that is
 
03:17:15.469 --> 03:17:15.479 align:start position:0%
keeping it in business only until May of
 
03:17:18.530 --> 03:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
2024 and again I asked the committee to
 
03:17:21.050 --> 03:17:21.060 align:start position:0%
consider where the megawatts will come
 
03:17:25.790 --> 03:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:28.610 --> 03:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
we have a demand problem in New England
 
03:17:30.830 --> 03:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
and we have a supply problem in New
 
03:17:32.210 --> 03:17:32.220 align:start position:0%
England and I apologize if that's
 
03:17:34.010 --> 03:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
repetitive because I have testified to
 
03:17:37.010 --> 03:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
it a number of times we do not have
 
03:17:40.010 --> 03:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
enough reliable low-cost sources of
 
03:17:42.650 --> 03:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
electricity to meet the demand
 
03:17:45.290 --> 03:17:45.300 align:start position:0%
the very best public policy is that this
 
03:17:48.650 --> 03:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
committee can pursue is reducing demand
 
03:17:51.110 --> 03:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
and increasing Supply
 
03:17:53.269 --> 03:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
as it stands today before that
 
03:17:55.849 --> 03:17:55.859 align:start position:0%
additional 5 000 megawatts of retirement
 
03:17:58.969 --> 03:17:58.979 align:start position:0%
as evidenced by Christmas Eve we are
 
03:18:01.130 --> 03:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
having a very difficult time
 
03:18:03.950 --> 03:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
meeting demand and keeping the lights on
 
03:18:07.490 --> 03:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:10.550 --> 03:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
the bill before you is a reasonable and
 
03:18:13.190 --> 03:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
I would actually say modest step to
 
03:18:15.590 --> 03:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
address this issue
 
03:18:18.050 --> 03:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
2 million megawatt hours may sound like
 
03:18:21.290 --> 03:18:21.300 align:start position:0%
a lot it is not 20 percent that grows
 
03:18:24.950 --> 03:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
each year it is a fixed number
 
03:18:26.870 --> 03:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
you have heard from
 
03:18:30.230 --> 03:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh renewable developers who have told
 
03:18:33.170 --> 03:18:33.180 align:start position:0%
you that in order to get financing to
 
03:18:35.230 --> 03:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
build new projects they require
 
03:18:37.550 --> 03:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
long-term certainty
 
03:18:41.330 --> 03:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
this bill enables utilities to offer
 
03:18:44.150 --> 03:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
that long-term certainty in order to
 
03:18:48.250 --> 03:18:48.260 align:start position:0%
build new resources to replace retiring
 
03:18:51.110 --> 03:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
existing resources
 
03:18:53.650 --> 03:18:53.660 align:start position:0%
it is a technology
 
03:18:56.630 --> 03:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
neutral procurement that is focused on
 
03:18:59.030 --> 03:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
cost and reliability
 
03:19:01.370 --> 03:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
there has been much discussion of other
 
03:19:04.070 --> 03:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
procurements in other states and the
 
03:19:06.230 --> 03:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
outcomes that they have produced
 
03:19:08.570 --> 03:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
I would submit to you those other
 
03:19:11.870 --> 03:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
procurements in all five other New
 
03:19:14.090 --> 03:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
England states that have occurred
 
03:19:16.670 --> 03:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
have been focused on very specific
 
03:19:16.680 --> 03:19:19.309 align:start position:0%
have been focused on very specific
Technologies

03:19:19.309 --> 03:19:19.319 align:start position:0%
Technologies
 
03:19:21.950 --> 03:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
procure offshore wind
 
03:19:24.650 --> 03:19:24.660 align:start position:0%
support existing nuclear
 
03:19:27.050 --> 03:19:27.060 align:start position:0%
the utilities that ran those
 
03:19:27.060 --> 03:19:30.410 align:start position:0%
the utilities that ran those
procurements

03:19:30.410 --> 03:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:32.809 --> 03:19:32.819 align:start position:0%
are not debating whether or not they
 
03:19:35.889 --> 03:19:35.899 align:start position:0%
would lower cost when entering into
 
03:19:38.389 --> 03:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
those contracts and submitting them for
 
03:19:41.150 --> 03:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
approval they were determining which is
 
03:19:43.370 --> 03:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
the lowest cost offshore wind contract
 
03:19:46.250 --> 03:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
available because that state and many of
 
03:19:48.410 --> 03:19:48.420 align:start position:0%
them have done this have had a public
 
03:19:51.769 --> 03:19:51.779 align:start position:0%
policy directive to enter into contracts
 
03:19:53.269 --> 03:19:53.279 align:start position:0%
for long-term wind
 
03:19:56.030 --> 03:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
I submit that is not what this bill does
 
03:19:58.910 --> 03:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
this bill is enabling the utilities to
 
03:20:01.130 --> 03:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
issue a competitive
 
03:20:05.590 --> 03:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh solicitation to get back low-cost
 
03:20:10.070 --> 03:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
reliable sources of energy
 
03:20:12.349 --> 03:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
it is a different approach I would
 
03:20:14.990 --> 03:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
submit is a New Hampshire approach to
 
03:20:17.750 --> 03:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
try to address this issue and as the
 
03:20:20.269 --> 03:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
department of energy said try to build
 
03:20:24.050 --> 03:20:24.060 align:start position:0%
new things new sources of supply
 
03:20:26.990 --> 03:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of talk about risk
 
03:20:29.210 --> 03:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
associated with the bill and there is
 
03:20:32.150 --> 03:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
risk there is no doubt no one has a
 
03:20:35.150 --> 03:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
crystal ball six months two years 20
 
03:20:37.790 --> 03:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
years however I would submit to you
 
03:20:41.150 --> 03:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
there is a risk in inaction
 
03:20:43.910 --> 03:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
your customer our customers your
 
03:20:46.670 --> 03:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
constituents are paying that risk today
 
03:20:48.590 --> 03:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
in their electric rates
 
03:20:52.370 --> 03:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
it is very clear and appropriate that
 
03:20:54.769 --> 03:20:54.779 align:start position:0%
these suppliers that bid back for
 
03:20:57.889 --> 03:20:57.899 align:start position:0%
default service are building in Risk
 
03:21:01.130 --> 03:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
they are not taking that risk they are
 
03:21:03.590 --> 03:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
building that risk into the bids that
 
03:21:06.290 --> 03:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
they offer back to utilities customers
 
03:21:08.750 --> 03:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
are paying that risk today
 
03:21:11.389 --> 03:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
they will continue to pay that risk
 
03:21:15.830 --> 03:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
until we solve this issue of wintertime
 
03:21:18.410 --> 03:21:18.420 align:start position:0%
pricing which is reliant on natural gas
 
03:21:24.650 --> 03:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:26.330 --> 03:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of discussion about
 
03:21:29.210 --> 03:21:29.220 align:start position:0%
the Burgess biomass contract I think Mr
 
03:21:31.250 --> 03:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
Evans Brown did a good job describing
 
03:21:33.730 --> 03:21:33.740 align:start position:0%
the differences between
 
03:21:36.889 --> 03:21:36.899 align:start position:0%
this approach and that power purchase
 
03:21:38.950 --> 03:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
agreement which was quite frankly
 
03:21:41.630 --> 03:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
specifically targeted to support a
 
03:21:44.510 --> 03:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
biomass plant in Berlin New Hampshire to
 
03:21:47.750 --> 03:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
address issues of economic development
 
03:21:50.690 --> 03:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
that occurred when a paper mill closed
 
03:21:53.929 --> 03:21:53.939 align:start position:0%
this is a very different approach
 
03:21:57.170 --> 03:21:57.180 align:start position:0%
I would submit to you that uh I think Mr
 
03:21:59.750 --> 03:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
Reynolds representative Reynolds uh
 
03:22:03.010 --> 03:22:03.020 align:start position:0%
described this well that the utilities
 
03:22:06.130 --> 03:22:06.140 align:start position:0%
are facilitating the financial
 
03:22:08.929 --> 03:22:08.939 align:start position:0%
transaction under this bill
 
03:22:10.849 --> 03:22:10.859 align:start position:0%
it is not as you heard previously
 
03:22:14.269 --> 03:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
rolling back restructuring allowing
 
03:22:16.190 --> 03:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
vertically integrated utilities the
 
03:22:19.130 --> 03:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
utilities own nothing under this bill we
 
03:22:21.590 --> 03:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
will competitively procure the best
 
03:22:24.710 --> 03:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
lowest cost responses back third parties
 
03:22:27.410 --> 03:22:27.420 align:start position:0%
will enter into agreements they will
 
03:22:30.349 --> 03:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
secure financing they will take risk if
 
03:22:33.170 --> 03:22:33.180 align:start position:0%
they cannot meet the requirements and
 
03:22:37.010 --> 03:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
the the terms of those contracts and the
 
03:22:41.030 --> 03:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
utility uh will not be constructing uh
 
03:22:43.910 --> 03:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:45.410 --> 03:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
I know you've had a lot of information
 
03:22:47.570 --> 03:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
thrown at you I would be very happy to
 
03:22:50.150 --> 03:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that I can
 
03:22:52.429 --> 03:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd be curious to know how a
 
03:22:54.349 --> 03:22:54.359 align:start position:0%
utility would respond to a question that
 
03:22:58.370 --> 03:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
was asked earlier about whether
 
03:23:02.389 --> 03:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
utility investors should share some of
 
03:23:03.590 --> 03:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
the risk
 
03:23:06.469 --> 03:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
rather than placing it all on the back
 
03:23:09.349 --> 03:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
of utility rate payers
 
03:23:11.150 --> 03:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
what's your what's your take on that
 
03:23:13.550 --> 03:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
question so so there have been
 
03:23:16.550 --> 03:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
regulatory mechanisms uh in other
 
03:23:19.670 --> 03:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions that uh as representative
 
03:23:22.910 --> 03:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
Harrington said reward the utility when
 
03:23:25.610 --> 03:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
they save money and charge the utility
 
03:23:29.269 --> 03:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
when they uh if if they miss the Mark I
 
03:23:31.130 --> 03:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
would suggest to you those were
 
03:23:34.610 --> 03:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
um uh regulatory mechanisms that were
 
03:23:37.190 --> 03:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
around the construction of projects
 
03:23:39.769 --> 03:23:39.779 align:start position:0%
where the utilities have some control
 
03:23:42.349 --> 03:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
over the costs associated with those
 
03:23:46.010 --> 03:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
projects here it is a third party that
 
03:23:48.950 --> 03:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
is is doing the project we are going to
 
03:23:51.550 --> 03:23:51.560 align:start position:0%
enter into uh we are going to solicit
 
03:23:54.950 --> 03:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
the lowest cost we're going to to do an
 
03:23:58.790 --> 03:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
analysis uh that will be submitted to
 
03:24:01.130 --> 03:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission and at
 
03:24:03.830 --> 03:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
that point in time be deemed in the
 
03:24:05.090 --> 03:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
public interest
 
03:24:07.309 --> 03:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
because the utility does not have
 
03:24:09.650 --> 03:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
control over the responses it receives
 
03:24:12.469 --> 03:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
or control over the costs associated
 
03:24:14.030 --> 03:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
with the the construction of that
 
03:24:14.040 --> 03:24:15.170 align:start position:0%
with the the construction of that
project

03:24:15.170 --> 03:24:15.180 align:start position:0%
project
 
03:24:17.330 --> 03:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
it would put the utility in an untenable
 
03:24:19.130 --> 03:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
position where we're taking on risk that
 
03:24:23.630 --> 03:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:26.510 --> 03:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
So you're satisfied that utility rate
 
03:24:28.309 --> 03:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
payers who have no way to mitigate those
 
03:24:30.889 --> 03:24:30.899 align:start position:0%
costs take on all those risks I I think
 
03:24:33.950 --> 03:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
that utility rate payers uh and this is
 
03:24:37.190 --> 03:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
true of of all states benefit from the
 
03:24:39.229 --> 03:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
development of additional resources
 
03:24:40.910 --> 03:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
whether they take utility default
 
03:24:42.530 --> 03:24:42.540 align:start position:0%
service or not
 
03:24:45.110 --> 03:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
competitive customers who take
 
03:24:48.769 --> 03:24:48.779 align:start position:0%
competitive Supply customers who are on
 
03:24:51.349 --> 03:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
Community power aggregation
 
03:24:54.110 --> 03:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
all benefit from the development of
 
03:24:56.330 --> 03:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
additional low-cost resources in fact Mr
 
03:24:59.630 --> 03:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
Dolan on behalf of nepka stated that in
 
03:25:01.729 --> 03:25:01.739 align:start position:0%
his testimony their concern with the
 
03:25:01.739 --> 03:25:02.570 align:start position:0%
his testimony their concern with the
bill

03:25:02.570 --> 03:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:25:07.849 --> 03:25:07.859 align:start position:0%
is that lower cost uh generation will be
 
03:25:10.490 --> 03:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
bid into the iso Market pushing out
 
03:25:13.130 --> 03:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
higher cost generation that simply can't
 
03:25:13.140 --> 03:25:14.570 align:start position:0%
higher cost generation that simply can't
compete

03:25:14.570 --> 03:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
compete
 
03:25:17.570 --> 03:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
resulting in lower costs which obviously
 
03:25:19.370 --> 03:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
is bad for incumbent generators I
 
03:25:22.010 --> 03:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
recognize that but is in fact good for
 
03:25:24.410 --> 03:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
consumers everyone benefits from that
 
03:25:25.969 --> 03:25:25.979 align:start position:0%
whether they're on default service or
 
03:25:25.979 --> 03:25:27.950 align:start position:0%
whether they're on default service or
not

03:25:27.950 --> 03:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:25:29.750 --> 03:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions from the
 
03:25:31.429 --> 03:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
committee representative Harrington has
 
03:25:33.290 --> 03:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
one thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:25:36.050 --> 03:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I'm just trying to
 
03:25:38.090 --> 03:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
get a feel for the market on this I mean
 
03:25:40.610 --> 03:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
everyone's talking about that no one's
 
03:25:42.769 --> 03:25:42.779 align:start position:0%
going to build without a PPA which I
 
03:25:44.690 --> 03:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
think everyone agrees with you simply
 
03:25:46.070 --> 03:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't get done
 
03:25:49.729 --> 03:25:49.739 align:start position:0%
but there are many other sources of ppas
 
03:25:52.309 --> 03:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
other than a regulated utility there's a
 
03:25:54.170 --> 03:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
lot of private contractors I know for
 
03:25:56.809 --> 03:25:56.819 align:start position:0%
example uh Starbucks or one of those
 
03:25:58.849 --> 03:25:58.859 align:start position:0%
other coffee places does it Whole Foods
 
03:26:01.130 --> 03:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
does it there's billions of dollars of
 
03:26:03.110 --> 03:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
federal subsidies out there and huge
 
03:26:04.729 --> 03:26:04.739 align:start position:0%
amounts of tax credits that these
 
03:26:07.370 --> 03:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
companies get yet it appears even though
 
03:26:09.710 --> 03:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
we're building wind utility scale wind
 
03:26:11.809 --> 03:26:11.819 align:start position:0%
and solar all over the country no one's
 
03:26:13.790 --> 03:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
doing it in New England and specifically
 
03:26:16.130 --> 03:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
no one's doing it in New Hampshire what
 
03:26:18.889 --> 03:26:18.899 align:start position:0%
is it about our markets here that make
 
03:26:22.309 --> 03:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
it so unpopular for people to willingly
 
03:26:26.030 --> 03:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
invest their money in power plants here
 
03:26:29.030 --> 03:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
so I I would suggest that uh utility
 
03:26:30.889 --> 03:26:30.899 align:start position:0%
scale solar is being built in New
 
03:26:33.229 --> 03:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
England and it is being built because
 
03:26:34.969 --> 03:26:34.979 align:start position:0%
other states have done competitive
 
03:26:37.429 --> 03:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
solicitations to enter into Power
 
03:26:39.769 --> 03:26:39.779 align:start position:0%
purchase agreements for for those
 
03:26:43.070 --> 03:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
resources that Contracting is going on I
 
03:26:45.710 --> 03:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
I think the question you're asking me is
 
03:26:48.830 --> 03:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
you know why aren't corporations uh
 
03:26:51.530 --> 03:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
investing in in this although I I guess
 
03:26:53.090 --> 03:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
if the question is why isn't that
 
03:26:55.130 --> 03:26:55.140 align:start position:0%
happening in New Hampshire
 
03:26:57.110 --> 03:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
because we aren't doing competitive
 
03:27:01.030 --> 03:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
solicitations for for uh projects
 
03:27:04.010 --> 03:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
we don't have this Authority in law
 
03:27:07.729 --> 03:27:07.739 align:start position:0%
today or it is unclear that utilities
 
03:27:09.650 --> 03:27:09.660 align:start position:0%
could could provide that long-term
 
03:27:11.510 --> 03:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
certainty to make those projects happen
 
03:27:13.790 --> 03:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
what we do see is in New Hampshire is
 
03:27:17.990 --> 03:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
much smaller projects usually uh uh
 
03:27:19.429 --> 03:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
purchase power agreements with
 
03:27:22.610 --> 03:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
municipalities that end up getting very
 
03:27:25.550 --> 03:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
small uh or smaller solar installations
 
03:27:27.769 --> 03:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
and Mr Herndon talked about the the one
 
03:27:30.650 --> 03:27:30.660 align:start position:0%
to five megawatts
 
03:27:33.410 --> 03:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
if you have 5 000 uh megawatts of
 
03:27:35.290 --> 03:27:35.300 align:start position:0%
generation that's going to be retiring
 
03:27:38.150 --> 03:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of solar projects that are
 
03:27:41.809 --> 03:27:41.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:44.330 --> 03:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
uh additional questions representative
 
03:27:46.849 --> 03:27:46.859 align:start position:0%
uh Wendy Thomas
 
03:27:48.710 --> 03:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you for
 
03:27:51.590 --> 03:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
being here and and giving some um good
 
03:27:54.170 --> 03:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
information uh would you be okay we've
 
03:27:55.849 --> 03:27:55.859 align:start position:0%
had a lot of discussion about May and
 
03:27:58.490 --> 03:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
Chao uh are you comfortable with
 
03:28:01.130 --> 03:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
changing uh the May to a shell for
 
03:28:03.229 --> 03:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
public comment and the May to a shell
 
03:28:04.849 --> 03:28:04.859 align:start position:0%
for reconciling the cost of the
 
03:28:07.309 --> 03:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
contracts through uh distribution rates
 
03:28:11.769 --> 03:28:11.779 align:start position:0%
yes okay to both thank you
 
03:28:14.570 --> 03:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
represent representative Summers has a
 
03:28:14.580 --> 03:28:15.290 align:start position:0%
represent representative Summers has a
question

03:28:15.290 --> 03:28:15.300 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:28:16.729 --> 03:28:16.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:28:18.229 --> 03:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question this is actually
 
03:28:19.729 --> 03:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
going to tie back to a question I asked
 
03:28:22.190 --> 03:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
earlier an earlier testimony about would
 
03:28:24.410 --> 03:28:24.420 align:start position:0%
this bill as written give the utilities
 
03:28:24.420 --> 03:28:25.849 align:start position:0%
this bill as written give the utilities
capability

03:28:25.849 --> 03:28:25.859 align:start position:0%
capability
 
03:28:28.309 --> 03:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
or the opportunity and capability to let
 
03:28:30.290 --> 03:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
not only ladder but also to be able to
 
03:28:32.510 --> 03:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
go back to the market more often than
 
03:28:34.309 --> 03:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
just once every six months
 
03:28:36.769 --> 03:28:36.779 align:start position:0%
this bill would not that that is not the
 
03:28:38.530 --> 03:28:38.540 align:start position:0%
focus of this this legislation
 
03:28:41.450 --> 03:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
03:28:42.889 --> 03:28:42.899 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you again for
 
03:28:44.030 --> 03:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
being here
 
03:28:45.590 --> 03:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for
 
03:28:45.600 --> 03:28:46.389 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for
um

03:28:46.389 --> 03:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:48.530 --> 03:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
characterizing I think correctly the
 
03:28:51.229 --> 03:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
role of the utility is basically a a
 
03:28:54.650 --> 03:28:54.660 align:start position:0%
financing facilitator and if I'm
 
03:28:57.889 --> 03:28:57.899 align:start position:0%
incorrect then please correct me and if
 
03:28:59.809 --> 03:28:59.819 align:start position:0%
if that is in fact the case which I
 
03:29:02.210 --> 03:29:02.220 align:start position:0%
think it is then
 
03:29:05.210 --> 03:29:05.220 align:start position:0%
um I I think it does make sense that the
 
03:29:07.070 --> 03:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
utility should be protected from risk
 
03:29:08.690 --> 03:29:08.700 align:start position:0%
because you're just providing a service
 
03:29:11.030 --> 03:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
but isn't it true that there would be
 
03:29:12.889 --> 03:29:12.899 align:start position:0%
another alternative
 
03:29:15.410 --> 03:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm not saying that it's something
 
03:29:16.969 --> 03:29:16.979 align:start position:0%
that we would want to pursue but the
 
03:29:19.070 --> 03:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
other alternative would be for the state
 
03:29:23.510 --> 03:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
to just be that credit worthy party
 
03:29:27.050 --> 03:29:27.060 align:start position:0%
um and and then if if that happened the
 
03:29:28.849 --> 03:29:28.859 align:start position:0%
state would be assuming the risk and the
 
03:29:30.349 --> 03:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayers would be assuming the risk
 
03:29:30.359 --> 03:29:31.190 align:start position:0%
taxpayers would be assuming the risk
correct

03:29:31.190 --> 03:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:29:33.170 --> 03:29:33.180 align:start position:0%
that is correct and other states have
 
03:29:36.710 --> 03:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
done procurements that were run by the
 
03:29:39.830 --> 03:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
state I think that is correct thank you
 
03:29:41.630 --> 03:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative
 
03:29:44.510 --> 03:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
Reynolds has one thank you Mr chairman
 
03:29:46.670 --> 03:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah I just wanted to clarify you you
 
03:29:49.309 --> 03:29:49.319 align:start position:0%
may have answered this already from
 
03:29:51.050 --> 03:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas question but I I
 
03:29:53.450 --> 03:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
want to be sure did you mean I was going
 
03:29:55.550 --> 03:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
to ask you about the
 
03:29:58.250 --> 03:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
how you felt about the bia's suggestion
 
03:29:58.260 --> 03:29:59.410 align:start position:0%
how you felt about the bia's suggestion
that

03:29:59.410 --> 03:29:59.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:30:03.530 --> 03:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
changing that may to shall which would
 
03:30:06.110 --> 03:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
essentially make the utility a facility
 
03:30:08.050 --> 03:30:08.060 align:start position:0%
a pass-through
 
03:30:10.790 --> 03:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
and and not allow the utility to sort of
 
03:30:14.269 --> 03:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
straddle the the market and and compete
 
03:30:16.370 --> 03:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
against the competitive suppliers
 
03:30:18.590 --> 03:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
is that is that what you meant that that
 
03:30:20.990 --> 03:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
is correct and I would say that that is
 
03:30:24.530 --> 03:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh the treatment of uh
 
03:30:26.690 --> 03:30:26.700 align:start position:0%
the law energy procured through
 
03:30:28.130 --> 03:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
long-term contracts and other
 
03:30:30.170 --> 03:30:30.180 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions some that eversource
 
03:30:31.929 --> 03:30:31.939 align:start position:0%
operates in and others that we do not
 
03:30:35.450 --> 03:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
that is consistent uh it is not to
 
03:30:38.030 --> 03:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
disrupt the competitive Marketplace the
 
03:30:40.429 --> 03:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
competitive uh you know folks are free
 
03:30:40.439 --> 03:30:41.870 align:start position:0%
competitive uh you know folks are free
to

03:30:41.870 --> 03:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:30:44.269 --> 03:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
um uh enter into agreements with
 
03:30:47.269 --> 03:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers uh and it is a a
 
03:30:51.530 --> 03:30:51.540 align:start position:0%
flow through uh that customers ideally
 
03:30:55.670 --> 03:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh and we do have uh uh you know
 
03:30:57.110 --> 03:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
examples of this received the benefit
 
03:30:59.150 --> 03:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
from not only from the development of
 
03:31:00.950 --> 03:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
new resources but receive the benefit
 
03:31:04.610 --> 03:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
from of a reduction a credit uh because
 
03:31:08.450 --> 03:31:08.460 align:start position:0%
the the uh the market price is higher
 
03:31:11.030 --> 03:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
than what the utility is selling into
 
03:31:13.550 --> 03:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
the the market so that that Delta ends
 
03:31:18.769 --> 03:31:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:21.050 --> 03:31:21.060 align:start position:0%
okay representative McGee has a question
 
03:31:23.750 --> 03:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I was hedging back
 
03:31:26.090 --> 03:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
and forth whether I'd ask this or not
 
03:31:30.710 --> 03:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
um so uh what I'm hearing is that
 
03:31:32.990 --> 03:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
um we're trying to solve
 
03:31:34.910 --> 03:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
several issues have come up that it
 
03:31:36.710 --> 03:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
appears we're trying to solve several
 
03:31:38.750 --> 03:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
bites at the Apple here
 
03:31:38.760 --> 03:31:39.469 align:start position:0%
bites at the Apple here
um

03:31:39.469 --> 03:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:42.410 --> 03:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
this bill is is looking to bring price
 
03:31:42.420 --> 03:31:44.269 align:start position:0%
this bill is is looking to bring price
stability

03:31:44.269 --> 03:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
stability
 
03:31:46.429 --> 03:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
um looking to be agnostic in terms of
 
03:31:47.750 --> 03:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
what type of fuel
 
03:31:50.450 --> 03:31:50.460 align:start position:0%
but you also brought up the numbers at
 
03:31:52.250 --> 03:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
the beginning of your testimony stating
 
03:31:55.309 --> 03:31:55.319 align:start position:0%
that part of the problem is that base
 
03:31:58.610 --> 03:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
load sources are rolling Off the Grid
 
03:32:01.670 --> 03:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
and although that is a something we
 
03:32:03.469 --> 03:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
should have a plan around in terms of
 
03:32:05.510 --> 03:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
how we're going to deal with it it also
 
03:32:08.030 --> 03:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
makes it seem like we're going to solve
 
03:32:10.309 --> 03:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
for that when in reality isn't it the
 
03:32:12.170 --> 03:32:12.180 align:start position:0%
grid operator's responsibility to make
 
03:32:13.910 --> 03:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
sure that there's adequate
 
03:32:16.250 --> 03:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
dispatchable Supply
 
03:32:20.330 --> 03:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
the iso New England's role is to to
 
03:32:24.170 --> 03:32:24.180 align:start position:0%
manage uh the wholesale
 
03:32:26.210 --> 03:32:26.220 align:start position:0%
generation system and transmission
 
03:32:26.220 --> 03:32:27.530 align:start position:0%
generation system and transmission
system

03:32:27.530 --> 03:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:32:29.750 --> 03:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
they can't
 
03:32:32.170 --> 03:32:32.180 align:start position:0%
make people build things
 
03:32:35.170 --> 03:32:35.180 align:start position:0%
they can as they are with Mystic station
 
03:32:39.469 --> 03:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
keeping a at-risk facility online for a
 
03:32:42.769 --> 03:32:42.779 align:start position:0%
limited amount of time does this bill
 
03:32:45.769 --> 03:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
solve all of the Region's reliability
 
03:32:50.389 --> 03:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
Pro problems absolutely not as I said 2
 
03:32:53.870 --> 03:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
million megawatts uh is is a relatively
 
03:32:55.929 --> 03:32:55.939 align:start position:0%
small amount
 
03:32:58.130 --> 03:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
but it is a step
 
03:33:00.170 --> 03:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
it is an important step
 
03:33:03.050 --> 03:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
it gives the utilities another tool in
 
03:33:05.809 --> 03:33:05.819 align:start position:0%
the toolbox as you heard previously it
 
03:33:08.870 --> 03:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
is enabling this is not a mandate and so
 
03:33:13.429 --> 03:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
yes it is the iso's job to quote unquote
 
03:33:15.229 --> 03:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
keep the lights on
 
03:33:16.610 --> 03:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
um however
 
03:33:19.010 --> 03:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
they're Limited in in what they can do
 
03:33:22.429 --> 03:33:22.439 align:start position:0%
and so I think a a you know this was
 
03:33:24.349 --> 03:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
described as one piece of the puzzle I
 
03:33:26.929 --> 03:33:26.939 align:start position:0%
think by the department of energy
 
03:33:29.510 --> 03:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
um ISO has been saying pretty loudly for
 
03:33:32.030 --> 03:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
a number of years that they see a train
 
03:33:33.830 --> 03:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
crash coming
 
03:33:36.830 --> 03:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
and so you know if they were able to
 
03:33:39.590 --> 03:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
incent the development or or of new
 
03:33:41.389 --> 03:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
resources I'm sure they would be doing
 
03:33:43.429 --> 03:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
everything they can to make sure the
 
03:33:44.750 --> 03:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
resources are there and I'm sure they
 
03:33:44.760 --> 03:33:49.969 align:start position:0%
resources are there and I'm sure they
are

03:33:49.969 --> 03:33:49.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:49.979 --> 03:33:52.370 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:33:52.370 --> 03:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:33:53.929 --> 03:33:53.939 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions from the
 
03:33:55.309 --> 03:33:55.319 align:start position:0%
committee I want to thank you and call
 
03:33:57.050 --> 03:33:57.060 align:start position:0%
our last speaker on this bill that's
 
03:33:58.910 --> 03:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
Mark Brown from the consumer energy
 
03:34:04.849 --> 03:34:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:07.790 --> 03:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
good afternoon and welcome
 
03:34:09.170 --> 03:34:09.180 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:34:10.969 --> 03:34:10.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
03:34:10.979 --> 03:34:11.870 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
committee

03:34:11.870 --> 03:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:34:13.670 --> 03:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Mark Brown I
 
03:34:15.229 --> 03:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
am vice president state affairs for
 
03:34:18.170 --> 03:34:18.180 align:start position:0%
Consumer Energy Alliance on behalf of CA
 
03:34:19.370 --> 03:34:19.380 align:start position:0%
I want to thank you for the opportunity
 
03:34:21.229 --> 03:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
to provide this testimony in support of
 
03:34:22.969 --> 03:34:22.979 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 54.
 
03:34:24.650 --> 03:34:24.660 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of talk today about
 
03:34:26.690 --> 03:34:26.700 align:start position:0%
you know volatility volatility in energy
 
03:34:29.929 --> 03:34:29.939 align:start position:0%
markets uh that's not just restrained to
 
03:34:32.269 --> 03:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
the New England area it's uh nationally
 
03:34:33.830 --> 03:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
and globally as well
 
03:34:36.110 --> 03:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
I think the geopolitical turmoil is
 
03:34:39.950 --> 03:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
probably not going away anytime soon one
 
03:34:42.530 --> 03:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
of the problems I would say with what's
 
03:34:44.330 --> 03:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
going on is New England we have a what
 
03:34:47.389 --> 03:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
is a single uniform clearing price in
 
03:34:50.750 --> 03:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
our energy markets that means that the
 
03:34:52.910 --> 03:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
whoever clears the stack is the marginal
 
03:34:55.070 --> 03:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
unit every unit below that gets paid
 
03:34:57.050 --> 03:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
whatever that clearing price is
 
03:35:01.370 --> 03:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
and as everybody knows we are relatively
 
03:35:03.050 --> 03:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
Supply constraint when it comes to
 
03:35:05.690 --> 03:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
natural gas you know in the winter time
 
03:35:08.150 --> 03:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
and about 70 percent of the time natural
 
03:35:10.070 --> 03:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
gas generators are the marginal unit
 
03:35:10.080 --> 03:35:11.750 align:start position:0%
gas generators are the marginal unit
there

03:35:11.750 --> 03:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:35:13.370 --> 03:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
um so that's probably not going to
 
03:35:14.750 --> 03:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
change anytime soon we're going to
 
03:35:17.090 --> 03:35:17.100 align:start position:0%
continue to see increased electricity
 
03:35:20.030 --> 03:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
demand as we continue to Electrify the
 
03:35:21.710 --> 03:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
transportation and heating sectors of
 
03:35:23.269 --> 03:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
our economy
 
03:35:25.490 --> 03:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
but touching on that I want to you know
 
03:35:27.229 --> 03:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
talk about what's kind of happening you
 
03:35:29.210 --> 03:35:29.220 align:start position:0%
know nationally so right now there's
 
03:35:32.929 --> 03:35:32.939 align:start position:0%
about 30 billion cubic feet a day of LNG
 
03:35:35.570 --> 03:35:35.580 align:start position:0%
export capacity being built
 
03:35:37.670 --> 03:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's been ferc approved and it's in the
 
03:35:41.570 --> 03:35:41.580 align:start position:0%
pipeline to to be built now we produce
 
03:35:43.969 --> 03:35:43.979 align:start position:0%
about 100 BCF a day which is we're at
 
03:35:46.370 --> 03:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
record levels of natural gas production
 
03:35:49.190 --> 03:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
so what that means is we're we're lined
 
03:35:51.170 --> 03:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
up to export 30 of our current
 
03:35:53.210 --> 03:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
production of natural gas
 
03:35:55.969 --> 03:35:55.979 align:start position:0%
so the volatility volatility in Newlands
 
03:35:58.070 --> 03:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
natural gas markets that's not going to
 
03:35:59.570 --> 03:35:59.580 align:start position:0%
change that's not going to change
 
03:36:01.130 --> 03:36:01.140 align:start position:0%
anytime soon and we're going to continue
 
03:36:02.929 --> 03:36:02.939 align:start position:0%
to need those natural gas plants for the
 
03:36:07.550 --> 03:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:09.550 --> 03:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
if New Hampshire was alone on an island
 
03:36:11.870 --> 03:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps that we you know we maybe we
 
03:36:14.269 --> 03:36:14.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be as subject to that type of
 
03:36:16.250 --> 03:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
volatility but we are part of a regional
 
03:36:17.870 --> 03:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
grid and we are subject to other states
 
03:36:20.389 --> 03:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
policies and we have to kind of play in
 
03:36:23.290 --> 03:36:23.300 align:start position:0%
that sandboard sandbox to some extent
 
03:36:26.450 --> 03:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
we view Senate Bill 54 as an opportunity
 
03:36:29.030 --> 03:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
to provide a hedge against the existing
 
03:36:32.809 --> 03:36:32.819 align:start position:0%
volatility in energy markets
 
03:36:34.370 --> 03:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
um and what I'll say is you know there
 
03:36:36.349 --> 03:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
are two states that have the last five
 
03:36:38.389 --> 03:36:38.399 align:start position:0%
years that have had substantially lower
 
03:36:41.210 --> 03:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
prices than the rest of the region
 
03:36:43.849 --> 03:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
um that's Vermont which remains
 
03:36:45.410 --> 03:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
vertically integrated I don't believe
 
03:36:46.910 --> 03:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
their utilities own a whole lot of
 
03:36:49.969 --> 03:36:49.979 align:start position:0%
generation if any but they have they
 
03:36:51.349 --> 03:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
purchased their power through a series
 
03:36:53.630 --> 03:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
of bilateral contracts one of those
 
03:36:55.910 --> 03:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
contracts is for about 25 percent of
 
03:36:58.309 --> 03:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
their power from Hydro Quebec which I
 
03:37:01.729 --> 03:37:01.739 align:start position:0%
think is a 25 or 26 year contract
 
03:37:03.650 --> 03:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
so for the last five years Vermont has
 
03:37:05.450 --> 03:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
had either the lowest electricity rates
 
03:37:07.130 --> 03:37:07.140 align:start position:0%
in the region or the second lowest rates
 
03:37:09.590 --> 03:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
in the region the other state that has
 
03:37:11.690 --> 03:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
had substantially lower rates is Maine
 
03:37:14.450 --> 03:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
which has a kind of an interconnection
 
03:37:15.889 --> 03:37:15.899 align:start position:0%
the northern part of the state connects
 
03:37:18.650 --> 03:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
to New Brunswick and uh that probably
 
03:37:20.750 --> 03:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
provides some hedge against volatility
 
03:37:23.630 --> 03:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
volatility of New England's markets
 
03:37:25.490 --> 03:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
so what I would say is I guess from a
 
03:37:26.929 --> 03:37:26.939 align:start position:0%
consumer perspective we can sit here and
 
03:37:28.490 --> 03:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
we could talk about markets markets
 
03:37:31.370 --> 03:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
markets I think ideologically I'm a huge
 
03:37:32.990 --> 03:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
supporter of markets but the bottom line
 
03:37:36.050 --> 03:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
is those markets are not delivering
 
03:37:40.429 --> 03:37:40.439 align:start position:0%
um affordable power to our consumers
 
03:37:40.439 --> 03:37:42.710 align:start position:0%
um affordable power to our consumers
um

03:37:42.710 --> 03:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:45.050 --> 03:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
you know I I think you know if you're
 
03:37:46.969 --> 03:37:46.979 align:start position:0%
looking at right now
 
03:37:49.490 --> 03:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
Vermont and New Hampshire there's a 10
 
03:37:51.469 --> 03:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
cent per kilowatt hour cost differential
 
03:37:53.929 --> 03:37:53.939 align:start position:0%
between the two states
 
03:37:56.210 --> 03:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
um now that may not last but right now
 
03:37:57.769 --> 03:37:57.779 align:start position:0%
10 cents a kilowatt hour is a lot of
 
03:37:59.389 --> 03:37:59.399 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of juice that's a lot of
 
03:38:01.790 --> 03:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
money if you look at just a one kilowatt
 
03:38:03.290 --> 03:38:03.300 align:start position:0%
one cent per kilowatt hour difference
 
03:38:05.030 --> 03:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
you're looking at about a 35 million
 
03:38:07.969 --> 03:38:07.979 align:start position:0%
dollar you know savings so to speak so
 
03:38:10.610 --> 03:38:10.620 align:start position:0%
if New Hampshire could lower its default
 
03:38:13.309 --> 03:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
Service rates by one cent you know with
 
03:38:15.050 --> 03:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
its load you'd be looking at 35 million
 
03:38:17.570 --> 03:38:17.580 align:start position:0%
dollar a year in savings so um this is
 
03:38:20.030 --> 03:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
not a mandate as has been repeated it's
 
03:38:21.530 --> 03:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
going to be it would be a competitive
 
03:38:21.540 --> 03:38:23.630 align:start position:0%
going to be it would be a competitive
solicitation

03:38:23.630 --> 03:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
solicitation
 
03:38:26.690 --> 03:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
um and as I mentioned previously we are
 
03:38:29.150 --> 03:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
going to see increased demand for
 
03:38:30.710 --> 03:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
electricity from the further
 
03:38:32.389 --> 03:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
electrification of the heating and
 
03:38:34.130 --> 03:38:34.140 align:start position:0%
transportation sectors and where is that
 
03:38:36.410 --> 03:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
power going to come from so with that
 
03:38:39.349 --> 03:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to and oh one other thing
 
03:38:40.910 --> 03:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington I want to take
 
03:38:41.990 --> 03:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
a stab at answering your question
 
03:38:44.150 --> 03:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
earlier about competitive suppliers and
 
03:38:45.410 --> 03:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
you know why don't they enter into
 
03:38:48.410 --> 03:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
long-term contracts they may we don't
 
03:38:50.809 --> 03:38:50.819 align:start position:0%
know that information is at the trading
 
03:38:52.790 --> 03:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
desk and it's not publicly available so
 
03:38:54.950 --> 03:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
they may very well be hedging part of
 
03:38:56.990 --> 03:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
their portfolio with longer term
 
03:38:57.000 --> 03:38:58.250 align:start position:0%
their portfolio with longer term
contracts

03:38:58.250 --> 03:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
03:38:59.929 --> 03:38:59.939 align:start position:0%
they just aren't subject to regulation
 
03:39:01.490 --> 03:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
by the state that prohibits them from
 
03:39:04.250 --> 03:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
doing so so they may not be but they
 
03:39:06.170 --> 03:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
very well could be we just don't know
 
03:39:08.150 --> 03:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll be happy to take any
 
03:39:08.160 --> 03:39:10.370 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll be happy to take any
questions

03:39:10.370 --> 03:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:39:12.410 --> 03:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
great thank you for that Illuminating
 
03:39:14.929 --> 03:39:14.939 align:start position:0%
testimony representative Kaplan has a
 
03:39:16.610 --> 03:39:16.620 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
03:39:19.250 --> 03:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
you for taking my my question
 
03:39:19.260 --> 03:39:20.150 align:start position:0%
you for taking my my question
um

03:39:20.150 --> 03:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:22.490 --> 03:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious where your organization
 
03:39:24.650 --> 03:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
sees any new generation capacity coming
 
03:39:26.510 --> 03:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
from to cover that hedge that you
 
03:39:28.190 --> 03:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned where do you see that
 
03:39:31.190 --> 03:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
generation we don't have interconnection
 
03:39:34.190 --> 03:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
to uh New Brunswick or right right so
 
03:39:35.929 --> 03:39:35.939 align:start position:0%
where would you see it coming from well
 
03:39:38.389 --> 03:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
if you look at the iso New England queue
 
03:39:40.790 --> 03:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
as Sam Evans Brown stated earlier you
 
03:39:43.130 --> 03:39:43.140 align:start position:0%
know it's all wind solar and storage
 
03:39:44.990 --> 03:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
um he's right I think the only fossil
 
03:39:46.490 --> 03:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
generation that's in the queue is a 50
 
03:39:49.849 --> 03:39:49.859 align:start position:0%
megawatt gas plant that's going to be um
 
03:39:51.830 --> 03:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
put into in Peabody and I'm sure that's
 
03:39:54.110 --> 03:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
going to be used to you know as a as a
 
03:39:56.150 --> 03:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
peaking unit to offset you know
 
03:39:57.889 --> 03:39:57.899 align:start position:0%
renewable energy load you know for the
 
03:39:59.330 --> 03:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
most part
 
03:40:01.309 --> 03:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
um and I would add Hydra to that you
 
03:40:02.929 --> 03:40:02.939 align:start position:0%
know you could possibly procure some
 
03:40:06.170 --> 03:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
some generation from Hydro Quebec I
 
03:40:08.750 --> 03:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
don't see any fossil fuel development
 
03:40:11.870 --> 03:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
you know in New Hampshire or beyond that
 
03:40:14.570 --> 03:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
50 megawatt plant in Peabody occurring
 
03:40:15.710 --> 03:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
in New England we don't have the
 
03:40:20.690 --> 03:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:25.790 --> 03:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions for Mr Brown
 
03:40:28.070 --> 03:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
seeing that I want to thank you for your
 
03:40:30.889 --> 03:40:30.899 align:start position:0%
testimony and since I have no more pink
 
03:40:34.070 --> 03:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
cards I'll ask representative closure
 
03:40:37.130 --> 03:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
before I wrap up business here to give
 
03:40:40.550 --> 03:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
us the uh
 
03:40:42.849 --> 03:40:42.859 align:start position:0%

03:40:45.110 --> 03:40:45.120 align:start position:0%

03:40:46.490 --> 03:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
we've heard here this morning so
 
03:40:48.950 --> 03:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative closure what's the what's
 
03:40:50.090 --> 03:40:50.100 align:start position:0%
it look like
 
03:40:52.910 --> 03:40:52.920 align:start position:0%

committee we'll see you back here at two
 
03:43:58.670 --> 03:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
o'clock everybody else
 
03:44:05.870 --> 03:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:53.330 --> 05:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:55.368 --> 05:06:55.378 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon everybody let's take
 
05:06:59.330 --> 05:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
our seats and uh let's uh open a full
 
05:07:02.750 --> 05:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
committee work session on the 12 Senate
 
05:07:07.128 --> 05:07:07.138 align:start position:0%
bills that we will be exacting tomorrow
 
05:07:09.050 --> 05:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
now representative McGee and I have
 
05:07:10.670 --> 05:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
already had a meeting about these 12
 
05:07:13.250 --> 05:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
bills we have a general sense of what
 
05:07:15.948 --> 05:07:15.958 align:start position:0%
our respective caucuses would like to do
 
05:07:18.470 --> 05:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
with these bills
 
05:07:20.090 --> 05:07:20.100 align:start position:0%
but of course
 
05:07:22.430 --> 05:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh individual
 
05:07:25.070 --> 05:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
conversations can change that consensus
 
05:07:27.650 --> 05:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
so we'll have to see during the course
 
05:07:29.690 --> 05:07:29.700 align:start position:0%
of our discussions here this afternoon
 
05:07:33.350 --> 05:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
just exactly where we are
 
05:07:35.330 --> 05:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
we think we know where we are but we're
 
05:07:36.288 --> 05:07:36.298 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
05:07:38.030 --> 05:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
so anyway what I'd like to do is I'd
 
05:07:39.590 --> 05:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
like to go through each of these bills
 
05:07:44.150 --> 05:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
and have a a general discussion
 
05:07:45.770 --> 05:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
we'll try to make it as quick as
 
05:07:47.090 --> 05:07:47.100 align:start position:0%
possible so we can get out of here
 
05:07:49.010 --> 05:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
before midnight
 
05:07:50.628 --> 05:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:07:52.368 --> 05:07:52.378 align:start position:0%
and then just go from there so let's
 
05:07:54.530 --> 05:07:54.540 align:start position:0%
start with Senate Bill 16. I'd like to
 
05:07:56.288 --> 05:07:56.298 align:start position:0%
do these in order
 
05:07:58.788 --> 05:07:58.798 align:start position:0%
apparently there's still
 
05:08:00.788 --> 05:08:00.798 align:start position:0%
um testimony
 
05:08:03.410 --> 05:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
circulating from
 
05:08:08.330 --> 05:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:09.890 --> 05:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a
 
05:08:11.628 --> 05:08:11.638 align:start position:0%
little little bit of a paperwork
 
05:08:16.570 --> 05:08:16.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:19.970 --> 05:08:19.980 align:start position:0%
52-54 so let's go back to uh Senate Bill
 
05:08:22.788 --> 05:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
16 which establishes a stakeholder group
 
05:08:25.190 --> 05:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
to address utility polls and attachments
 
05:08:27.590 --> 05:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
05:08:30.170 --> 05:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
anybody have anything they would like to
 
05:08:36.050 --> 05:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:38.030 --> 05:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
05:08:40.368 --> 05:08:40.378 align:start position:0%
this has been a problem and an issue for
 
05:08:42.350 --> 05:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
I'm aware for at least 20 years and I'm
 
05:08:44.330 --> 05:08:44.340 align:start position:0%
sure it goes on much longer than that so
 
05:08:46.910 --> 05:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
anything we can do to fix this let's go
 
05:08:48.708 --> 05:08:48.718 align:start position:0%
for it
 
05:08:50.868 --> 05:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Doug
 
05:08:50.878 --> 05:08:52.190 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Doug
Thomas

05:08:52.190 --> 05:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
Thomas
 
05:08:54.830 --> 05:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
I agree with the uh representative I I'm
 
05:08:58.010 --> 05:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:00.708 --> 05:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas no I I'm
 
05:09:02.448 --> 05:09:02.458 align:start position:0%
just going to say this is a no-brainer
 
05:09:02.458 --> 05:09:04.788 align:start position:0%
just going to say this is a no-brainer
yeah

05:09:04.788 --> 05:09:04.798 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:09:04.798 --> 05:09:05.990 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

05:09:05.990 --> 05:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:09:06.000 --> 05:09:06.708 align:start position:0%
okay
um

05:09:06.708 --> 05:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:10.550 --> 05:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
it has been suggested to me that a
 
05:09:13.128 --> 05:09:13.138 align:start position:0%
Sunset date might be appropriate for
 
05:09:15.410 --> 05:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
this legislation anybody have any
 
05:09:21.050 --> 05:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:23.868 --> 05:09:23.878 align:start position:0%
of us on set date
 
05:09:26.930 --> 05:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
the way the bill is worded this uh the
 
05:09:30.368 --> 05:09:30.378 align:start position:0%
advisory committee that's established
 
05:09:32.390 --> 05:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
by this
 
05:09:35.628 --> 05:09:35.638 align:start position:0%
legislation would
 
05:09:35.638 --> 05:09:37.368 align:start position:0%
legislation would
never

05:09:37.368 --> 05:09:37.378 align:start position:0%
never
 
05:09:40.010 --> 05:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
end it would just go on forever
 
05:09:43.368 --> 05:09:43.378 align:start position:0%
filing reports Etc somebody suggested it
 
05:09:45.708 --> 05:09:45.718 align:start position:0%
might be worthwhile to to Sunset
 
05:09:49.090 --> 05:09:49.100 align:start position:0%
after some period of time
 
05:09:52.310 --> 05:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
so I was just trying to get a sense of
 
05:09:53.628 --> 05:09:53.638 align:start position:0%
whether anybody thought that was a good
 
05:09:56.390 --> 05:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
idea a bad idea don't care I think it's
 
05:09:58.368 --> 05:09:58.378 align:start position:0%
a good idea
 
05:10:01.430 --> 05:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
05:10:03.530 --> 05:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
intention of the bill is to come to some
 
05:10:05.930 --> 05:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
conclusions and recommendations
 
05:10:07.368 --> 05:10:07.378 align:start position:0%
I would say that it may make sense to
 
05:10:08.868 --> 05:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
Sunset that still
 
05:10:11.810 --> 05:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
spifter six years or when a final
 
05:10:13.430 --> 05:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
conclusion report has been issued
 
05:10:14.990 --> 05:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
addressing all of the topics something
 
05:10:16.730 --> 05:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
like that
 
05:10:19.550 --> 05:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
okay that's a good idea
 
05:10:26.690 --> 05:10:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:28.208 --> 05:10:28.218 align:start position:0%
while seeing none
 
05:10:32.090 --> 05:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
I will uh later today I will
 
05:10:35.810 --> 05:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
ask OLS to create an amendment to this
 
05:10:39.350 --> 05:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
bill to add a Sunset date you suggested
 
05:10:41.810 --> 05:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
five six years would five years be okay
 
05:10:44.208 --> 05:10:44.218 align:start position:0%
just as a more round number
 
05:10:46.070 --> 05:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to conclude when we
 
05:10:48.050 --> 05:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
normally issue reports so if it's the
 
05:10:49.970 --> 05:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
end of a term you know or two-year
 
05:10:52.190 --> 05:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
legislative period okay I'll look at
 
05:10:53.330 --> 05:10:53.340 align:start position:0%
that yeah
 
05:10:56.570 --> 05:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
I'll do what seems to make sense
 
05:10:59.448 --> 05:10:59.458 align:start position:0%
okay anything else on 16.
 
05:11:02.270 --> 05:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
let's go to SB 40.
 
05:11:07.430 --> 05:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
now I sent you via email an amendment to
 
05:11:07.440 --> 05:11:08.990 align:start position:0%
now I sent you via email an amendment to
sb40

05:11:08.990 --> 05:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
sb40
 
05:11:12.530 --> 05:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
I think I sent it out on Friday
 
05:11:16.190 --> 05:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
there's new language in there that
 
05:11:16.200 --> 05:11:17.810 align:start position:0%
there's new language in there that
that

05:11:17.810 --> 05:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:11:21.350 --> 05:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
lengthens the arms of the straitjacket
 
05:11:23.208 --> 05:11:23.218 align:start position:0%
that this bill puts around the
 
05:11:25.788 --> 05:11:25.798 align:start position:0%
definition of customer generator so that
 
05:11:27.948 --> 05:11:27.958 align:start position:0%
the only two projects in the in the
 
05:11:30.530 --> 05:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
entire world that this could apply to
 
05:11:33.708 --> 05:11:33.718 align:start position:0%
would be Monadnock paper and Brookfield
 
05:11:33.718 --> 05:11:35.868 align:start position:0%
would be Monadnock paper and Brookfield
Hydro

05:11:35.868 --> 05:11:35.878 align:start position:0%
Hydro
 
05:11:39.590 --> 05:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
and we feel I feel relatively confident
 
05:11:42.410 --> 05:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
that that this bill now accomplishes
 
05:11:42.420 --> 05:11:44.628 align:start position:0%
that that this bill now accomplishes
everything

05:11:44.628 --> 05:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
everything
 
05:11:47.288 --> 05:11:47.298 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to accomplish without
 
05:11:52.990 --> 05:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:56.390 --> 05:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
unforeseen circumstance that's going to
 
05:11:59.390 --> 05:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
destroy the world so uh
 
05:12:02.390 --> 05:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any comment on that
 
05:12:05.030 --> 05:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you I
 
05:12:06.470 --> 05:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't here when they had the hearing
 
05:12:09.770 --> 05:12:09.780 align:start position:0%
for this but in your your description
 
05:12:11.930 --> 05:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
right now you say that this bill is
 
05:12:15.230 --> 05:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
again it's just for two companies
 
05:12:17.990 --> 05:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
and we had a the Burgess Bill recently
 
05:12:20.270 --> 05:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
that was just for one company I just are
 
05:12:22.490 --> 05:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
we in the business now of creating bills
 
05:12:25.850 --> 05:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
specifically for specific companies
 
05:12:28.070 --> 05:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
I would say no we're in the business of
 
05:12:28.080 --> 05:12:30.708 align:start position:0%
I would say no we're in the business of
addressing

05:12:30.708 --> 05:12:30.718 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
05:12:33.230 --> 05:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
problems that appla that might apply to
 
05:12:35.448 --> 05:12:35.458 align:start position:0%
one or two companies in the case of
 
05:12:37.970 --> 05:12:37.980 align:start position:0%
these two Hydro facilities they were
 
05:12:37.980 --> 05:12:39.948 align:start position:0%
these two Hydro facilities they were
wired

05:12:39.948 --> 05:12:39.958 align:start position:0%
wired
 
05:12:42.948 --> 05:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
dozens of years ago decades ago in such
 
05:12:46.070 --> 05:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
a way that uh
 
05:12:48.590 --> 05:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
we would they would never be wired that
 
05:12:51.230 --> 05:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
way today it's a it's a legacy
 
05:12:54.590 --> 05:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
Antiquated way of wiring up uh these
 
05:12:56.990 --> 05:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
interconnections and
 
05:12:58.850 --> 05:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
they were never changed it's too
 
05:13:01.368 --> 05:13:01.378 align:start position:0%
expensive to rewire them from the way
 
05:13:03.170 --> 05:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
they were originally wired
 
05:13:08.570 --> 05:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
and uh so the only way to fix that is to
 
05:13:11.990 --> 05:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
write legislation that applies to these
 
05:13:16.250 --> 05:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
Legacy problems and fixes them
 
05:13:18.410 --> 05:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
so when I said this only applied to
 
05:13:21.050 --> 05:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
Monadnock paper and Brookfield I didn't
 
05:13:23.090 --> 05:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
really mean that it only applies to
 
05:13:25.730 --> 05:13:25.740 align:start position:0%
those two companies I mean it applies to
 
05:13:28.910 --> 05:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
their unique dilemma which is the way
 
05:13:32.030 --> 05:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
they are wired or interconnected to
 
05:13:34.970 --> 05:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:39.050 --> 05:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
any further comment on sb40
 
05:13:41.990 --> 05:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative munz I just had a had a
 
05:13:42.890 --> 05:13:42.900 align:start position:0%
question I know there was some
 
05:13:45.170 --> 05:13:45.180 align:start position:0%
discussion during the um
 
05:13:47.628 --> 05:13:47.638 align:start position:0%
testimony we received about what what
 
05:13:50.570 --> 05:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
might happen if
 
05:13:52.730 --> 05:13:52.740 align:start position:0%
um the paper mill goes on goes out of
 
05:13:52.740 --> 05:13:53.750 align:start position:0%
um the paper mill goes on goes out of
business

05:13:53.750 --> 05:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
business
 
05:13:56.390 --> 05:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
does that does that does does your
 
05:13:58.128 --> 05:13:58.138 align:start position:0%
Amendment address that or does it need
 
05:13:59.510 --> 05:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
to address it
 
05:14:01.550 --> 05:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
no the amendment does not address that
 
05:14:05.510 --> 05:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's a PPA question and we asked the
 
05:14:07.150 --> 05:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
two companies
 
05:14:09.350 --> 05:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
involved Brookfield and White Mountain
 
05:14:11.750 --> 05:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
paper to
 
05:14:14.690 --> 05:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
discuss between themselves
 
05:14:16.788 --> 05:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
how they would address that and they'd
 
05:14:18.410 --> 05:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
if it informed us that they've come up
 
05:14:22.430 --> 05:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
with a uh agreeable
 
05:14:24.708 --> 05:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
compromised resolution
 
05:14:28.610 --> 05:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
to their uh existing
 
05:14:28.620 --> 05:14:32.690 align:start position:0%
to their uh existing
arrangement

05:14:32.690 --> 05:14:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:35.570 --> 05:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
represented I mean Mr kuzzy do you have
 
05:14:38.390 --> 05:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
anything to add to that
 
05:14:42.590 --> 05:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:44.208 --> 05:14:44.218 align:start position:0%
why don't you come up to the microphone
 
05:14:52.490 --> 05:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:54.350 --> 05:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman appreciate the
 
05:14:59.030 --> 05:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
Indulgence uh representative uh
 
05:15:02.270 --> 05:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
in the event that the mill were to cease
 
05:15:05.990 --> 05:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
operations the owner of the mill uh
 
05:15:08.990 --> 05:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
would still be the utility customer of
 
05:15:09.000 --> 05:15:10.190 align:start position:0%
would still be the utility customer of
record

05:15:10.190 --> 05:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
record
 
05:15:14.090 --> 05:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
uh that and they they would still be
 
05:15:17.448 --> 05:15:17.458 align:start position:0%
they would still need uh some
 
05:15:20.150 --> 05:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
electricity just to make sure the the
 
05:15:22.070 --> 05:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
buildings don't go into some semblance
 
05:15:24.410 --> 05:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
of disrepair things along those lines so
 
05:15:26.510 --> 05:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
even if there's no operation the owner
 
05:15:28.250 --> 05:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
of the mill itself would retain
 
05:15:30.708 --> 05:15:30.718 align:start position:0%
ownership it'd be the utility uh that
 
05:15:32.150 --> 05:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
would be something that would be sold if
 
05:15:34.250 --> 05:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
the mill changed ownership but it
 
05:15:35.868 --> 05:15:35.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't just become
 
05:15:38.390 --> 05:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
suddenly the property of of Brookfield
 
05:15:40.550 --> 05:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh for lack of a better other way to
 
05:15:43.128 --> 05:15:43.138 align:start position:0%
phrase it
 
05:15:45.770 --> 05:15:45.780 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question okay and
 
05:15:49.430 --> 05:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
and the the way the the bill was written
 
05:15:51.650 --> 05:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
allows for that without the need for
 
05:15:55.310 --> 05:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
other it it accepts changes in LA in in
 
05:15:56.810 --> 05:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
ownership and whatnot without the need
 
05:15:58.610 --> 05:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
to have to come back here to see you
 
05:15:58.620 --> 05:15:59.930 align:start position:0%
to have to come back here to see you
folks

05:15:59.930 --> 05:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
folks
 
05:16:02.150 --> 05:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:16:03.830 --> 05:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:16:06.288 --> 05:16:06.298 align:start position:0%
any other comments about
 
05:16:11.448 --> 05:16:11.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:13.070 --> 05:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none let's move on to
 
05:16:15.070 --> 05:16:15.080 align:start position:0%
Senate bill
 
05:16:15.080 --> 05:16:16.970 align:start position:0%
Senate bill
52

05:16:16.970 --> 05:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
52
 
05:16:19.070 --> 05:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
relative to the regulation and operation
 
05:16:24.730 --> 05:16:24.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:27.830 --> 05:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
charging stations I should say comments
 
05:16:31.670 --> 05:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
on Senate bill 42.
 
05:16:31.680 --> 05:16:35.390 align:start position:0%
on Senate bill 42.
52.

05:16:35.390 --> 05:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:37.430 --> 05:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
05:16:39.650 --> 05:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
knowing that uh
 
05:16:41.690 --> 05:16:41.700 align:start position:0%
there is at least a couple of other
 
05:16:44.330 --> 05:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
amendments out there dealing with EV
 
05:16:46.670 --> 05:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
charging one being one that I believe
 
05:16:49.730 --> 05:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
that our Sheriff here introduced
 
05:16:51.708 --> 05:16:51.718 align:start position:0%
do you think it may be possible to look
 
05:16:53.570 --> 05:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
at some amendments to this particular
 
05:16:53.580 --> 05:16:57.230 align:start position:0%
at some amendments to this particular
bill

05:16:57.230 --> 05:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:00.170 --> 05:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
I would guess that would depend on how
 
05:17:01.788 --> 05:17:01.798 align:start position:0%
extensive the amendments were because
 
05:17:03.590 --> 05:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
we'd have to have them in Hand by
 
05:17:03.600 --> 05:17:04.730 align:start position:0%
we'd have to have them in Hand by
tomorrow

05:17:04.730 --> 05:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
05:17:07.128 --> 05:17:07.138 align:start position:0%
so that would mean filing them with OLS
 
05:17:10.690 --> 05:17:10.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:13.730 --> 05:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
okay another possibility would be to
 
05:17:16.190 --> 05:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
retain this bill and deal with it later
 
05:17:18.708 --> 05:17:18.718 align:start position:0%
then we'd have plenty of time to amend
 
05:17:18.718 --> 05:17:19.910 align:start position:0%
then we'd have plenty of time to amend
it

05:17:19.910 --> 05:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:17:24.230 --> 05:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
um may I you may um thank you if it were
 
05:17:26.150 --> 05:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
retained we would not be looking at it
 
05:17:26.160 --> 05:17:28.250 align:start position:0%
retained we would not be looking at it
until

05:17:28.250 --> 05:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
until
 
05:17:32.150 --> 05:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:37.190 --> 05:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:39.470 --> 05:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
I I really don't know what I think I'll
 
05:17:42.288 --> 05:17:42.298 align:start position:0%
be honest with you I I I even think I'm
 
05:17:44.810 --> 05:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
neutral on it right now
 
05:17:46.730 --> 05:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
representative McGee
 
05:17:49.368 --> 05:17:49.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I think
 
05:17:52.310 --> 05:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
did we did we pose a question to someone
 
05:17:54.110 --> 05:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
on was it this bill or a different bill
 
05:17:56.690 --> 05:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
that we were asking whether they thought
 
05:17:58.010 --> 05:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
the bills
 
05:18:00.170 --> 05:18:00.180 align:start position:0%
that the commission should be merged or
 
05:18:02.208 --> 05:18:02.218 align:start position:0%
the committee should be merged was that
 
05:18:04.430 --> 05:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:18:09.650 --> 05:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
Bill yes it was this bill sets up a
 
05:18:09.660 --> 05:18:12.050 align:start position:0%
Bill yes it was this bill sets up a
committee

05:18:12.050 --> 05:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:18:14.150 --> 05:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
as I recall
 
05:18:16.550 --> 05:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
that right here yeah and I think I think
 
05:18:18.770 --> 05:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
the answer was no that they were doing
 
05:18:20.208 --> 05:18:20.218 align:start position:0%
two different things
 
05:18:22.610 --> 05:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
yes that was the answer we heard so that
 
05:18:24.230 --> 05:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
I just thought of that when I heard
 
05:18:25.788 --> 05:18:25.798 align:start position:0%
representative partial's question that
 
05:18:28.550 --> 05:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
maybe that might help clarify whether or
 
05:18:30.948 --> 05:18:30.958 align:start position:0%
not we should be considering rolling um
 
05:18:32.690 --> 05:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
you know the mission of a different
 
05:18:34.368 --> 05:18:34.378 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation and would this one
 
05:18:35.690 --> 05:18:35.700 align:start position:0%
might make it
 
05:18:38.930 --> 05:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:40.368 --> 05:18:40.378 align:start position:0%
okay good point
 
05:18:43.850 --> 05:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
uh representative mums I think I think
 
05:18:46.070 --> 05:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
that we also during the testimony we
 
05:18:48.350 --> 05:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
heard that section four of the Bills
 
05:18:49.610 --> 05:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
should be deleted
 
05:18:53.448 --> 05:18:53.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:55.430 --> 05:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's a relatively simple amendment
 
05:18:59.270 --> 05:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
that I'd be happy to submit if
 
05:19:01.310 --> 05:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
people agree
 
05:19:01.320 --> 05:19:02.690 align:start position:0%
people agree
okay

05:19:02.690 --> 05:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:19:04.850 --> 05:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
representative munz will put you on the
 
05:19:06.170 --> 05:19:06.180 align:start position:0%
case for that
 
05:19:08.628 --> 05:19:08.638 align:start position:0%
submitting a separate Amendment for that
 
05:19:10.368 --> 05:19:10.378 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
05:19:12.770 --> 05:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
so I guess what I would ask then is if
 
05:19:14.330 --> 05:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
there's any other changes we want to
 
05:19:16.730 --> 05:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
make to the bill we try to roll those
 
05:19:20.208 --> 05:19:20.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:20.218 --> 05:19:20.890 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:19:20.890 --> 05:19:20.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:23.990 --> 05:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
well I can tell you in in general terms
 
05:19:24.000 --> 05:19:25.550 align:start position:0%
well I can tell you in in general terms
that

05:19:25.550 --> 05:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:19:25.560 --> 05:19:31.368 align:start position:0%
that
um

05:19:31.368 --> 05:19:31.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:33.890 --> 05:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
there doesn't seem to be other than the
 
05:19:40.730 --> 05:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:42.670 --> 05:19:42.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
05:19:46.310 --> 05:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
usefulness in this legislation
 
05:19:46.320 --> 05:19:47.930 align:start position:0%
usefulness in this legislation
and

05:19:47.930 --> 05:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:19:50.628 --> 05:19:50.638 align:start position:0%
knowing that creating more study
 
05:19:52.010 --> 05:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
committees is something that leadership
 
05:19:54.590 --> 05:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't favor at this point in
 
05:19:54.600 --> 05:19:56.570 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't favor at this point in
time

05:19:56.570 --> 05:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:19:59.270 --> 05:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if if either ital or
 
05:20:01.910 --> 05:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
retain would be the solution to this to
 
05:20:04.070 --> 05:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
this bill I don't see it going forward
 
05:20:08.270 --> 05:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:10.128 --> 05:20:10.138 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas
 
05:20:11.948 --> 05:20:11.958 align:start position:0%
I think Mr
 
05:20:14.208 --> 05:20:14.218 align:start position:0%
along those lines
 
05:20:16.970 --> 05:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
um I I do have some some issues with
 
05:20:18.110 --> 05:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
05:20:20.390 --> 05:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
potential sources of funding that they
 
05:20:22.490 --> 05:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
have for these the committee that would
 
05:20:24.530 --> 05:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
be studying all of them would involve
 
05:20:27.708 --> 05:20:27.718 align:start position:0%
either some type of a surcharge or or
 
05:20:31.910 --> 05:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
subsidy uh more like a hidden tax
 
05:20:34.610 --> 05:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
um you know I think we should you know
 
05:20:36.590 --> 05:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
if if this bill passed at all we'd have
 
05:20:38.868 --> 05:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
to we would have to eliminate all those
 
05:20:41.690 --> 05:20:41.700 align:start position:0%
potential sources as a as as potential
 
05:20:44.270 --> 05:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
sources because that's just increasing
 
05:20:45.470 --> 05:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:20:47.150 --> 05:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
the bills
 
05:20:49.788 --> 05:20:49.798 align:start position:0%
so do I understand you correctly that
 
05:20:52.190 --> 05:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the
 
05:20:54.170 --> 05:20:54.180 align:start position:0%
the duties that the study committee
 
05:20:57.948 --> 05:20:57.958 align:start position:0%
would have to look at right identify
 
05:21:01.850 --> 05:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
additional and uh sources of
 
05:21:04.788 --> 05:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
non-rapear sources of funding right yeah
 
05:21:06.670 --> 05:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
just it opens the door too much for
 
05:21:09.288 --> 05:21:09.298 align:start position:0%
increasing your bill right
 
05:21:12.250 --> 05:21:12.260 align:start position:0%
further comments representative closure
 
05:21:15.890 --> 05:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair yes representative uh
 
05:21:17.628 --> 05:21:17.638 align:start position:0%
Thomas Doug
 
05:21:20.030 --> 05:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
brought up the same thing I was
 
05:21:22.368 --> 05:21:22.378 align:start position:0%
to me when I read that all they're doing
 
05:21:22.378 --> 05:21:23.410 align:start position:0%
to me when I read that all they're doing
is

05:21:23.410 --> 05:21:23.420 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:21:26.868 --> 05:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
saying that the rate pairs won't pay but
 
05:21:29.208 --> 05:21:29.218 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers will and they gave seven
 
05:21:32.750 --> 05:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
examples that's my issue it just
 
05:21:34.070 --> 05:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
someone else is paying not the right
 
05:21:34.080 --> 05:21:35.208 align:start position:0%
someone else is paying not the right
paid

05:21:35.208 --> 05:21:35.218 align:start position:0%
paid
 
05:21:36.890 --> 05:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
okay good point
 
05:21:38.930 --> 05:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
additional comments representative
 
05:21:41.930 --> 05:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
Carmen has one
 
05:21:43.850 --> 05:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:21:46.128 --> 05:21:46.138 align:start position:0%
um I I don't read all of these possible
 
05:21:49.190 --> 05:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
funding mechanisms as pushing onto
 
05:21:51.890 --> 05:21:51.900 align:start position:0%
taxpayers for example EV registration
 
05:21:54.490 --> 05:21:54.500 align:start position:0%
surcharges that's for people with EVS
 
05:21:56.930 --> 05:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
surcharges on electricity purchased
 
05:21:58.910 --> 05:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
through public electric vehicle charging
 
05:22:01.910 --> 05:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
stations that's that's a user fee
 
05:22:04.850 --> 05:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
and the the bill says potential sources
 
05:22:07.550 --> 05:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
of funding may include but are and are
 
05:22:10.190 --> 05:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
not limited to these items so it's just
 
05:22:12.590 --> 05:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
listing some possibilities uh it would
 
05:22:14.810 --> 05:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
really be up to this the committee to
 
05:22:17.690 --> 05:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
decide what sources to to use
 
05:22:20.150 --> 05:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
to to all that I want to add the
 
05:22:23.090 --> 05:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
importance of the testimony about the
 
05:22:25.128 --> 05:22:25.138 align:start position:0%
tourism industry
 
05:22:26.390 --> 05:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
um I mean this is something I was
 
05:22:28.128 --> 05:22:28.138 align:start position:0%
thinking about and talking about when I
 
05:22:30.288 --> 05:22:30.298 align:start position:0%
was campaigning last summer just
 
05:22:33.230 --> 05:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
thinking about how we do get most of our
 
05:22:36.350 --> 05:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
tourists driving from Southern New
 
05:22:38.690 --> 05:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
England New York New Jersey they're
 
05:22:41.208 --> 05:22:41.218 align:start position:0%
going to our ski areas they're hiking
 
05:22:44.030 --> 05:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
and if and we're going to see more and
 
05:22:46.310 --> 05:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
more EVS regardless of what we would
 
05:22:48.770 --> 05:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
like to see they're coming you know what
 
05:22:50.750 --> 05:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
we think doesn't matter what Mary Barra
 
05:22:52.970 --> 05:22:52.980 align:start position:0%
chair chair of the board of GM thinks
 
05:22:54.708 --> 05:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
that's what matters
 
05:22:54.718 --> 05:22:56.628 align:start position:0%
that's what matters
and

05:22:56.628 --> 05:22:56.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:22:56.638 --> 05:22:57.890 align:start position:0%
and
if

05:22:57.890 --> 05:22:57.900 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:23:00.708 --> 05:23:00.718 align:start position:0%
if tourists feel like well I can get to
 
05:23:02.270 --> 05:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I just don't know that I
 
05:23:04.190 --> 05:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
can get home they're not going to come
 
05:23:06.170 --> 05:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
here and we're going to feel that
 
05:23:09.050 --> 05:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so I believe that
 
05:23:10.730 --> 05:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
we really do need to be looking at this
 
05:23:12.770 --> 05:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
and get ahead of it
 
05:23:12.780 --> 05:23:15.128 align:start position:0%
and get ahead of it
foreign

05:23:15.128 --> 05:23:15.138 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:23:17.570 --> 05:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
representative Arrington
 
05:23:19.550 --> 05:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
I would say that's all fine and good but
 
05:23:21.708 --> 05:23:21.718 align:start position:0%
uh if the tourists want to come let them
 
05:23:23.390 --> 05:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
pay so if there's going to be a
 
05:23:25.128 --> 05:23:25.138 align:start position:0%
surcharge on those that's fine but I
 
05:23:26.930 --> 05:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
don't want to see uh State utility
 
05:23:29.030 --> 05:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
property tax credits local tax
 
05:23:32.448 --> 05:23:32.458 align:start position:0%
exemptions room and meals tax or any
 
05:23:34.250 --> 05:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
other type of tax going to fund these
 
05:23:35.990 --> 05:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
let the people who use the service pay
 
05:23:39.830 --> 05:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:42.230 --> 05:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
okay additional comments representative
 
05:23:42.240 --> 05:23:43.490 align:start position:0%
okay additional comments representative
McGee

05:23:43.490 --> 05:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
McGee
 
05:23:45.470 --> 05:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair
 
05:23:47.390 --> 05:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
um Bliss kind of makes my point for me
 
05:23:50.208 --> 05:23:50.218 align:start position:0%
but that's I think the point of the the
 
05:23:53.030 --> 05:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
committee is that they need to look at
 
05:23:55.190 --> 05:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
the potential funding sources and try
 
05:23:56.628 --> 05:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
and determine which way New Hampshire is
 
05:23:58.190 --> 05:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
going to go so I think they're going to
 
05:24:01.250 --> 05:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
be examining uh how each of these works
 
05:24:02.628 --> 05:24:02.638 align:start position:0%
so that they can come up with a policy
 
05:24:05.270 --> 05:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
that actually meets our needs it doesn't
 
05:24:07.010 --> 05:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
mean that any of these are particularly
 
05:24:09.770 --> 05:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
going to be selected it just means they
 
05:24:12.410 --> 05:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
should be in the pot for consideration
 
05:24:14.390 --> 05:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
because they represent funding sources
 
05:24:16.730 --> 05:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
that are available that's all
 
05:24:18.948 --> 05:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
so I I think it just makes the case that
 
05:24:21.830 --> 05:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's a bill that probably should pass so
 
05:24:25.010 --> 05:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:29.628 --> 05:24:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:32.350 --> 05:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
okay let's now talk about Senate bill
 
05:24:36.948 --> 05:24:36.958 align:start position:0%
54. now this is a big and uh complicated
 
05:24:40.910 --> 05:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
Bill we heard lots of Pros lots of cons
 
05:24:43.910 --> 05:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
and uh now we got to decide what we're
 
05:24:46.788 --> 05:24:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:49.250 --> 05:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
I'm anxious to hear what you might think
 
05:24:51.230 --> 05:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
is this something we should move forward
 
05:24:52.910 --> 05:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
with is this something that's going to
 
05:24:54.830 --> 05:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
require more study
 
05:24:56.690 --> 05:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
what's uh what's the deal here
 
05:24:59.570 --> 05:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas
 
05:25:01.550 --> 05:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
I would like the committee to consider
 
05:25:03.110 --> 05:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
retaining this bill so that we could
 
05:25:04.628 --> 05:25:04.638 align:start position:0%
work on some of the language
 
05:25:09.410 --> 05:25:09.420 align:start position:0%
specifically the maze to shells and the
 
05:25:11.690 --> 05:25:11.700 align:start position:0%
addition of of prioritizing New
 
05:25:14.628 --> 05:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire projects over other state
 
05:25:18.590 --> 05:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:18.600 --> 05:25:19.730 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:25:19.730 --> 05:25:19.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:25:22.070 --> 05:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
additional comments about
 
05:25:27.590 --> 05:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:30.410 --> 05:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington yeah thank you
 
05:25:30.420 --> 05:25:31.070 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington yeah thank you
um

05:25:31.070 --> 05:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:34.010 --> 05:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
there's an awful lot in this bill and
 
05:25:36.948 --> 05:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
it's very very complicated and
 
05:25:36.958 --> 05:25:37.730 align:start position:0%
it's very very complicated and
um

05:25:37.730 --> 05:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:39.890 --> 05:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
as I said I looked into it and checked
 
05:25:41.390 --> 05:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
with some people and purchased power
 
05:25:43.250 --> 05:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
Agreements are more being in the 10 to
 
05:25:45.650 --> 05:25:45.660 align:start position:0%
15 year range than 20 but on the
 
05:25:47.690 --> 05:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
balancing side if you're going to be if
 
05:25:48.770 --> 05:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
it's going to be qualified for
 
05:25:50.930 --> 05:25:50.940 align:start position:0%
transmission then you probably have to
 
05:25:53.030 --> 05:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
go with the 20 years I'm still not sure
 
05:25:57.010 --> 05:25:57.020 align:start position:0%
of reading this where it talks about
 
05:25:59.690 --> 05:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
what's what's considered acceptable
 
05:26:02.510 --> 05:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
where it talks about that uh electric
 
05:26:04.910 --> 05:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
energy sources so I guess that could be
 
05:26:06.830 --> 05:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
read to say that new transmission say
 
05:26:08.270 --> 05:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
from Hydro Quebec which I think would
 
05:26:09.470 --> 05:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
probably be a
 
05:26:12.288 --> 05:26:12.298 align:start position:0%
first big one we could get actually uh
 
05:26:14.208 --> 05:26:14.218 align:start position:0%
but that could be lawyer to death too in
 
05:26:15.590 --> 05:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
the courts and I think that that part
 
05:26:17.930 --> 05:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
needs to be cleared uh clarified so it's
 
05:26:19.670 --> 05:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
clearly that it can be either generate
 
05:26:22.850 --> 05:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
new generation or new transmission
 
05:26:23.990 --> 05:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and there's a few other things in
 
05:26:25.788 --> 05:26:25.798 align:start position:0%
here that I just I I would think this
 
05:26:27.288 --> 05:26:27.298 align:start position:0%
needs to have a little bit more
 
05:26:29.570 --> 05:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
inspection before we do something this
 
05:26:31.490 --> 05:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
big I know there's somewhat of a time
 
05:26:34.788 --> 05:26:34.798 align:start position:0%
limit we are acting somewhat as a result
 
05:26:37.190 --> 05:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
of the prices we saw this winter but
 
05:26:38.990 --> 05:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
remember the actual wholesale prices
 
05:26:40.850 --> 05:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
with 30 percent lower
 
05:26:42.650 --> 05:26:42.660 align:start position:0%
it was just the retail prices that were
 
05:26:44.390 --> 05:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
higher this winter so I would say this
 
05:26:46.610 --> 05:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
is probably ripe for being retained and
 
05:26:48.410 --> 05:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
we could look at it literally closely
 
05:26:50.330 --> 05:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
because this is a major change
 
05:26:51.770 --> 05:26:51.780 align:start position:0%
one of the other things we heard a lot
 
05:26:53.750 --> 05:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
about is does it how does it affect the
 
05:26:55.970 --> 05:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
other part of the Electoral contracts
 
05:26:58.610 --> 05:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
the six six year of the six month ones
 
05:27:01.490 --> 05:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
that go out and puc is looking at this
 
05:27:02.690 --> 05:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
and I just think we ought to pull that
 
05:27:04.850 --> 05:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
together and maybe we want to have some
 
05:27:06.890 --> 05:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
options so you know the puc has the
 
05:27:08.208 --> 05:27:08.218 align:start position:0%
authority to say well based on what
 
05:27:10.310 --> 05:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
we're looking at now they can go up for
 
05:27:12.170 --> 05:27:12.180 align:start position:0%
a year-long contract or a three-month
 
05:27:13.670 --> 05:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
contract whatever it is but there's just
 
05:27:14.868 --> 05:27:14.878 align:start position:0%
a lot of stuff that needs to be pulled
 
05:27:16.128 --> 05:27:16.138 align:start position:0%
together and this is a major major
 
05:27:18.708 --> 05:27:18.718 align:start position:0%
policy change because it's a shift away
 
05:27:20.510 --> 05:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
from the restructuring markets that we
 
05:27:21.890 --> 05:27:21.900 align:start position:0%
set up I just think it needs a little
 
05:27:24.110 --> 05:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
bit more time to look at and possibly
 
05:27:27.970 --> 05:27:27.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:30.288 --> 05:27:30.298 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a comment
 
05:27:32.930 --> 05:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I agree with the two
 
05:27:34.550 --> 05:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
previous representative statements This
 
05:27:38.090 --> 05:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
is highly complicated and probably most
 
05:27:41.030 --> 05:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
best worked out uh by being retained I
 
05:27:44.330 --> 05:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
do have some problems with um uh the uh
 
05:27:46.310 --> 05:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
20-year statement perhaps it could be
 
05:27:49.690 --> 05:27:49.700 align:start position:0%
rewarded to reflect the in certain areas
 
05:27:53.030 --> 05:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
transmission versus other types that
 
05:27:54.288 --> 05:27:54.298 align:start position:0%
should be that could be worked out when
 
05:27:57.288 --> 05:27:57.298 align:start position:0%
we retain this bill and I'm not sure I
 
05:27:59.628 --> 05:27:59.638 align:start position:0%
totally agree about changing the the May
 
05:28:01.128 --> 05:28:01.138 align:start position:0%
statements to Shell so I think there's
 
05:28:03.230 --> 05:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
some things to be to be discussed here
 
05:28:05.030 --> 05:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
and retaining is probably the best
 
05:28:05.040 --> 05:28:06.350 align:start position:0%
and retaining is probably the best
action

05:28:06.350 --> 05:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
action
 
05:28:06.360 --> 05:28:07.310 align:start position:0%
action
foreign

05:28:07.310 --> 05:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:28:10.610 --> 05:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
okay another option to retain if we
 
05:28:12.590 --> 05:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
think this bill needs further study
 
05:28:15.350 --> 05:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
would be to
 
05:28:17.628 --> 05:28:17.638 align:start position:0%
open the pub the exact session tomorrow
 
05:28:18.948 --> 05:28:18.958 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:28:18.958 --> 05:28:21.410 align:start position:0%
and then
uh

05:28:21.410 --> 05:28:21.420 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:28:24.770 --> 05:28:24.780 align:start position:0%
end it or or resume it
 
05:28:26.948 --> 05:28:26.958 align:start position:0%
no what's the word of the recess it
 
05:28:30.350 --> 05:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
resets it until a future date and we
 
05:28:32.030 --> 05:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
have a couple of weeks we could we could
 
05:28:33.530 --> 05:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
spend looking at it so that's an
 
05:28:36.010 --> 05:28:36.020 align:start position:0%
alternative to think about
 
05:28:40.250 --> 05:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
we don't have to say tomorrow yes no or
 
05:28:43.910 --> 05:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
retain we could we could put it off for
 
05:28:45.170 --> 05:28:45.180 align:start position:0%
a week or two
 
05:28:47.150 --> 05:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons I set up the exact
 
05:28:48.530 --> 05:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
session for tomorrow
 
05:28:52.490 --> 05:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
was to find out just where we were on
 
05:28:54.530 --> 05:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
these bills to figure out if there
 
05:28:56.330 --> 05:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
wasn't a need
 
05:28:56.340 --> 05:28:57.650 align:start position:0%
wasn't a need
for

05:28:57.650 --> 05:28:57.660 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:28:59.570 --> 05:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
adding extra time onto any of these
 
05:29:01.430 --> 05:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
bills so that's another thing to think
 
05:29:01.440 --> 05:29:02.750 align:start position:0%
bills so that's another thing to think
about

05:29:02.750 --> 05:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:29:06.410 --> 05:29:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:09.890 --> 05:29:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:13.310 --> 05:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman overall I've
 
05:29:14.690 --> 05:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
probably made this pretty clear in my
 
05:29:19.190 --> 05:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
questions overall 54 FN SP 54 FN I'm I'm
 
05:29:21.830 --> 05:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
completely against it and I'm just
 
05:29:25.910 --> 05:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
straight out because of a the uh the
 
05:29:28.990 --> 05:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
contract requirements any length of time
 
05:29:31.128 --> 05:29:31.138 align:start position:0%
discrepancy if they can't the company
 
05:29:33.770 --> 05:29:33.780 align:start position:0%
distributor the generator can't meet
 
05:29:36.288 --> 05:29:36.298 align:start position:0%
those demands and then also skin in the
 
05:29:38.510 --> 05:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
game too it even mentions here on one of
 
05:29:40.368 --> 05:29:40.378 align:start position:0%
the pages where the difference would be
 
05:29:42.948 --> 05:29:42.958 align:start position:0%
taken care of by the the distribution
 
05:29:45.590 --> 05:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
rate payers and the where the utilities
 
05:29:47.510 --> 05:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
have no skin in the game at all it all
 
05:29:48.830 --> 05:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
falls on the ratepayers so I'm
 
05:29:51.708 --> 05:29:51.718 align:start position:0%
completely against it
 
05:29:51.718 --> 05:29:53.090 align:start position:0%
completely against it
okay

05:29:53.090 --> 05:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:29:55.310 --> 05:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
any additional comment on Senate Bill
 
05:29:58.850 --> 05:29:58.860 align:start position:0%
54. representative McGee yeah the the
 
05:30:01.670 --> 05:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
thought I would add is that I I look at
 
05:30:05.330 --> 05:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
the bill and I see uh a lot of attempts
 
05:30:07.430 --> 05:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
to try and bring it to where it needs to
 
05:30:10.368 --> 05:30:10.378 align:start position:0%
be and so it started out as one thing
 
05:30:11.750 --> 05:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
and then it kind of morphed into
 
05:30:13.310 --> 05:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
something else with an amendment that
 
05:30:15.230 --> 05:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
took certain sections of it in a
 
05:30:17.570 --> 05:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
different direction and I do think it
 
05:30:20.390 --> 05:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
needs some attention and also some
 
05:30:23.150 --> 05:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
more discussion around what we're
 
05:30:25.788 --> 05:30:25.798 align:start position:0%
ultimately trying to achieve
 
05:30:27.590 --> 05:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
um I think a lot of the testimony was
 
05:30:30.350 --> 05:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
clear but it seems like it's a bill that
 
05:30:32.030 --> 05:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
depending on who's testifying on it it's
 
05:30:34.010 --> 05:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
in the eye of the beholder and I would
 
05:30:36.410 --> 05:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
like to have a greater sense of you know
 
05:30:38.090 --> 05:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
what we are achieving with the bill are
 
05:30:40.250 --> 05:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
we helping to lower rates are we helping
 
05:30:42.830 --> 05:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
reliability are we helping to diversify
 
05:30:45.470 --> 05:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
you know our energy are we trying to
 
05:30:47.270 --> 05:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
make sure there's more in-state energy
 
05:30:50.750 --> 05:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
all those things were were items that
 
05:30:52.788 --> 05:30:52.798 align:start position:0%
were mentioned in the testimony but I
 
05:30:54.708 --> 05:30:54.718 align:start position:0%
think if we were a little more clearly
 
05:30:56.690 --> 05:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
focused about what the Bill's objectives
 
05:30:58.550 --> 05:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
are and whether we're not whether we're
 
05:30:59.810 --> 05:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
going to be achieving them by what we're
 
05:31:01.430 --> 05:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
putting in that we'd be happier with it
 
05:31:04.610 --> 05:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
so I'm for retaining it I'm not sure we
 
05:31:06.948 --> 05:31:06.958 align:start position:0%
can get it where it needs to go
 
05:31:09.650 --> 05:31:09.660 align:start position:0%
um in a couple of days but
 
05:31:11.930 --> 05:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
um you know I'll I'll defer to the
 
05:31:15.230 --> 05:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:20.230 --> 05:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:23.090 --> 05:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to spend a week looking at
 
05:31:24.410 --> 05:31:24.420 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:31:26.570 --> 05:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
would that get us anywhere does anybody
 
05:31:28.070 --> 05:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
think we could get anywhere with with
 
05:31:31.670 --> 05:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
that kind of a an approach
 
05:31:33.770 --> 05:31:33.780 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington I think we
 
05:31:35.390 --> 05:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
need more time because I would like to
 
05:31:37.128 --> 05:31:37.138 align:start position:0%
get the puc's input on this because
 
05:31:39.110 --> 05:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
they've been looking into this and they
 
05:31:40.730 --> 05:31:40.740 align:start position:0%
may be able to shed a lot of light on
 
05:31:41.990 --> 05:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
where you want to go and where you don't
 
05:31:44.208 --> 05:31:44.218 align:start position:0%
want to go and trying to set that up and
 
05:31:45.890 --> 05:31:45.900 align:start position:0%
Rush something out just to say we're
 
05:31:47.750 --> 05:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
doing something I would rather get it
 
05:31:49.550 --> 05:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
right and if that means waiting till
 
05:31:51.770 --> 05:31:51.780 align:start position:0%
September I I think that would be a
 
05:31:53.868 --> 05:31:53.878 align:start position:0%
Preferred Choice
 
05:31:53.878 --> 05:31:57.288 align:start position:0%
Preferred Choice
foreign

05:31:57.288 --> 05:31:57.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:59.930 --> 05:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
representative Summers
 
05:32:01.788 --> 05:32:01.798 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman the key points to me that
 
05:32:04.070 --> 05:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
I'd be willing to go along with a
 
05:32:07.030 --> 05:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
retainer work on this bill so long as
 
05:32:10.190 --> 05:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
page three line 18 and 19 was stricken
 
05:32:13.490 --> 05:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:13.500 --> 05:32:17.090 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:32:17.090 --> 05:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:21.650 --> 05:32:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:24.770 --> 05:32:24.780 align:start position:0%
all right let's move on uh I guess
 
05:32:26.868 --> 05:32:26.878 align:start position:0%
tomorrow will be the
 
05:32:29.930 --> 05:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
the decider for this bill
 
05:32:31.670 --> 05:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
will have to vote
 
05:32:34.850 --> 05:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
to do something with it tomorrow
 
05:32:37.010 --> 05:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
all right Senate Bill 68 which is
 
05:32:38.868 --> 05:32:38.878 align:start position:0%
relative to the municipal host for
 
05:32:40.310 --> 05:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
purposes of
 
05:32:40.320 --> 05:32:41.750 align:start position:0%
purposes of
LIPA

05:32:41.750 --> 05:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
LIPA
 
05:32:43.368 --> 05:32:43.378 align:start position:0%
we actually already passed the house
 
05:32:45.890 --> 05:32:45.900 align:start position:0%
already passed how House Bill 139 which
 
05:32:49.128 --> 05:32:49.138 align:start position:0%
is kind of this bill with a little bit
 
05:32:55.070 --> 05:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
more so I I suspect that
 
05:32:57.890 --> 05:32:57.900 align:start position:0%
we might as well just pass this bill
 
05:33:00.590 --> 05:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
just to uh
 
05:33:03.110 --> 05:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
go along with the Senate I don't see any
 
05:33:05.208 --> 05:33:05.218 align:start position:0%
reason not to anybody have any
 
05:33:11.030 --> 05:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:14.570 --> 05:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
Senate bill sorry representative Corman
 
05:33:16.610 --> 05:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr Truman
 
05:33:19.970 --> 05:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
um there the bill uh the Senate bill is
 
05:33:23.390 --> 05:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
not exactly the same as the one that
 
05:33:25.490 --> 05:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
passed the house though
 
05:33:26.990 --> 05:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
right there there is a slight difference
 
05:33:28.970 --> 05:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
right there is a difference yes yeah
 
05:33:30.948 --> 05:33:30.958 align:start position:0%
yeah the Senate bill is actually the
 
05:33:32.448 --> 05:33:32.458 align:start position:0%
amendment that
 
05:33:34.910 --> 05:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
um did not pass in this committee
 
05:33:38.390 --> 05:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
correct so uh so if if we pass it then
 
05:33:39.770 --> 05:33:39.780 align:start position:0%
it will still have to go to conference
 
05:33:40.788 --> 05:33:40.798 align:start position:0%
is that right
 
05:33:43.128 --> 05:33:43.138 align:start position:0%
no not necessarily what would happen the
 
05:33:45.050 --> 05:33:45.060 align:start position:0%
Senate would probably just concur with
 
05:33:48.470 --> 05:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:50.390 --> 05:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
the alternative would would be we could
 
05:33:53.810 --> 05:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
kill this bill since they have 139 in
 
05:33:53.820 --> 05:33:55.430 align:start position:0%
kill this bill since they have 139 in
hand

05:33:55.430 --> 05:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
hand
 
05:33:57.770 --> 05:33:57.780 align:start position:0%
any appetite for that
 
05:34:00.288 --> 05:34:00.298 align:start position:0%
no I don't want to kill it
 
05:34:04.670 --> 05:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:08.330 --> 05:34:08.340 align:start position:0%
representative McGee yeah this is just
 
05:34:08.340 --> 05:34:09.288 align:start position:0%
representative McGee yeah this is just
um

05:34:09.288 --> 05:34:09.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:10.910 --> 05:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
I was gonna say locker room talk that's
 
05:34:12.948 --> 05:34:12.958 align:start position:0%
not what it is but this scuttlebutt on
 
05:34:16.788 --> 05:34:16.798 align:start position:0%
the street is that uh that really the
 
05:34:19.550 --> 05:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
the support for getting it over the
 
05:34:21.530 --> 05:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
governor's desk was the Senate Bill 68
 
05:34:22.730 --> 05:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
was going to be the vehicle at least
 
05:34:24.470 --> 05:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
that's what I heard is that the
 
05:34:26.030 --> 05:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
preference of the Senate not that it has
 
05:34:28.610 --> 05:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
to be our preference and actually to
 
05:34:31.368 --> 05:34:31.378 align:start position:0%
representative corman's Point uh I
 
05:34:33.650 --> 05:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
believe it was uh Dr Krishan who had put
 
05:34:33.660 --> 05:34:34.490 align:start position:0%
believe it was uh Dr Krishan who had put
in

05:34:34.490 --> 05:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:34:36.410 --> 05:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
the the language that we didn't pass
 
05:34:38.810 --> 05:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
which became Senate Bill 68 so I don't
 
05:34:40.970 --> 05:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
think we have any reason not to vote for
 
05:34:45.350 --> 05:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
it that's my opinion we'll do that then
 
05:34:48.830 --> 05:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm Center Bill 69
 
05:34:52.368 --> 05:34:52.378 align:start position:0%
which creates a new customer generator
 
05:34:56.330 --> 05:34:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:58.128 --> 05:34:58.138 align:start position:0%
anybody have any reaction to that bill
 
05:35:01.128 --> 05:35:01.138 align:start position:0%
my reaction would be that we don't need
 
05:35:02.750 --> 05:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
to create
 
05:35:05.570 --> 05:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
new groups for
 
05:35:08.090 --> 05:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
customer generators new definitions for
 
05:35:10.430 --> 05:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
customer generators the department of
 
05:35:12.788 --> 05:35:12.798 align:start position:0%
energy already warned us that doing so
 
05:35:17.930 --> 05:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
would be a dangerous precedent so I
 
05:35:19.610 --> 05:35:19.620 align:start position:0%
would not be in favor of moving forward
 
05:35:21.948 --> 05:35:21.958 align:start position:0%
with this bill but I'd be interested to
 
05:35:26.270 --> 05:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:28.970 --> 05:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr
 
05:35:28.980 --> 05:35:30.350 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr
chairman

05:35:30.350 --> 05:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:35:32.448 --> 05:35:32.458 align:start position:0%
um I think this gets back to that we're
 
05:35:34.310 --> 05:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
seeing a lot of requests for carve outs
 
05:35:35.810 --> 05:35:35.820 align:start position:0%
because we don't have you know the one
 
05:35:38.030 --> 05:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
to five megawatt policy in place for
 
05:35:40.910 --> 05:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
folks that want to invest here but I I
 
05:35:43.730 --> 05:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
look at this bill as as really
 
05:35:43.740 --> 05:35:44.510 align:start position:0%
look at this bill as as really
um

05:35:44.510 --> 05:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:47.570 --> 05:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
various aspects of our constituency just
 
05:35:49.310 --> 05:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
asking us to give them a break on their
 
05:35:51.708 --> 05:35:51.718 align:start position:0%
bills just like many of the other
 
05:35:53.810 --> 05:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
efforts that we're pursuing so
 
05:35:57.230 --> 05:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
I see it as some of the large off-takers
 
05:35:59.930 --> 05:35:59.940 align:start position:0%
of Power are saying you know let us make
 
05:36:03.050 --> 05:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
this economically available to us to to
 
05:36:04.368 --> 05:36:04.378 align:start position:0%
make these Investments and we're willing
 
05:36:05.930 --> 05:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
to make these Investments so that we can
 
05:36:08.868 --> 05:36:08.878 align:start position:0%
lower our costs so I I have a positive
 
05:36:13.610 --> 05:36:13.620 align:start position:0%
disposition towards SB 69
 
05:36:16.810 --> 05:36:16.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't making something economically
 
05:36:19.930 --> 05:36:19.940 align:start position:0%
viable for one group
 
05:36:22.368 --> 05:36:22.378 align:start position:0%
disadvantage some other group that would
 
05:36:24.890 --> 05:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
be my well that's the problem with this
 
05:36:27.230 --> 05:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
kind of legislation that's uh that's one
 
05:36:29.330 --> 05:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
philosophy it's kind of a zero-sum game
 
05:36:31.128 --> 05:36:31.138 align:start position:0%
thing but I think if we're trying to get
 
05:36:33.948 --> 05:36:33.958 align:start position:0%
people to we're saying why aren't people
 
05:36:35.570 --> 05:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
investing I think this is why people
 
05:36:38.208 --> 05:36:38.218 align:start position:0%
aren't investing because so far we've
 
05:36:39.590 --> 05:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
put our thumb on the scale the other way
 
05:36:41.810 --> 05:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
to say yeah we're not going to give you
 
05:36:43.910 --> 05:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
any incentive to do that investing for
 
05:36:46.310 --> 05:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
us so that we have a more diverse Energy
 
05:36:46.320 --> 05:36:47.570 align:start position:0%
us so that we have a more diverse Energy
Mix

05:36:47.570 --> 05:36:47.580 align:start position:0%
Mix
 
05:36:47.580 --> 05:36:49.330 align:start position:0%
Mix
so

05:36:49.330 --> 05:36:49.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:36:52.970 --> 05:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
representative muns thank you
 
05:36:55.250 --> 05:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
um the nonprofit sector is one of the
 
05:36:59.270 --> 05:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
largest employers in the state and their
 
05:37:02.030 --> 05:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
operating margins are incredibly small
 
05:37:05.750 --> 05:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
and anything we can do to enable them to
 
05:37:08.930 --> 05:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
continue to be able to function and
 
05:37:10.910 --> 05:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
provide the service the very important
 
05:37:12.890 --> 05:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
services that people rely on in the
 
05:37:16.250 --> 05:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
state and keep those people employed is
 
05:37:17.810 --> 05:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
something that I think we should be
 
05:37:20.750 --> 05:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
encouraging and so I I Echo what
 
05:37:22.670 --> 05:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative McGee is saying I think
 
05:37:24.530 --> 05:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
it's important to move forward
 
05:37:26.690 --> 05:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
05:37:29.150 --> 05:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
yeah this is another uh step that we've
 
05:37:31.128 --> 05:37:31.138 align:start position:0%
been doing way way too much over the
 
05:37:33.110 --> 05:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
last 20 years and that's we think
 
05:37:34.970 --> 05:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
something's a good idea and we want to
 
05:37:36.650 --> 05:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
pay for it we don't want to put a tax
 
05:37:38.990 --> 05:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
out there and use the word tax so we
 
05:37:41.510 --> 05:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
hide it in electric rates so I'm opposed
 
05:37:42.890 --> 05:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
to this like I'd be opposed to anything
 
05:37:45.110 --> 05:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
you think this is a great idea sponsor a
 
05:37:46.670 --> 05:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
bill and says
 
05:37:48.288 --> 05:37:48.298 align:start position:0%
we'll put a tax on everyone's electric
 
05:37:49.910 --> 05:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
rates when they get their bill it says
 
05:37:51.470 --> 05:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
oh I'm paying a dollar and a half tax
 
05:37:54.050 --> 05:37:54.060 align:start position:0%
this month for subsidizing some program
 
05:37:56.270 --> 05:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
that someone thinks is a good idea be
 
05:37:58.310 --> 05:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
open transparent about it don't hide it
 
05:38:01.128 --> 05:38:01.138 align:start position:0%
in the electric bills
 
05:38:04.730 --> 05:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
further comment representative Corman
 
05:38:07.128 --> 05:38:07.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I have to confess
 
05:38:08.448 --> 05:38:08.458 align:start position:0%
I have a certain affinity for
 
05:38:10.128 --> 05:38:10.138 align:start position:0%
non-profits I'm on the development
 
05:38:12.110 --> 05:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
committee of a non-profit and I'm also
 
05:38:13.850 --> 05:38:13.860 align:start position:0%
the grant writer and I just know how
 
05:38:16.670 --> 05:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
hard it is to for non-profits to fund
 
05:38:19.368 --> 05:38:19.378 align:start position:0%
what they do and I feel like anything we
 
05:38:21.708 --> 05:38:21.718 align:start position:0%
can do I mean you know us the science
 
05:38:23.330 --> 05:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
technology and energy committee what can
 
05:38:25.430 --> 05:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
we do for non-profits this is something
 
05:38:27.170 --> 05:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
that we can do for non-profits to make
 
05:38:29.570 --> 05:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
their lives a little easier and allow
 
05:38:32.390 --> 05:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
them to do a little bit more
 
05:38:34.910 --> 05:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds thank you Mr
 
05:38:40.070 --> 05:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
chairman um yeah again uh this bill is
 
05:38:43.250 --> 05:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
about simply removing an arbitrary
 
05:38:47.628 --> 05:38:47.638 align:start position:0%
restriction that has been placed on the
 
05:38:50.330 --> 05:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
scale of
 
05:38:53.030 --> 05:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
renewable development that makes it
 
05:38:56.208 --> 05:38:56.218 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult economically to make
 
05:38:58.490 --> 05:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
them make sense we've heard numerous
 
05:39:01.570 --> 05:39:01.580 align:start position:0%
folks testify over the past few months
 
05:39:05.330 --> 05:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
about how restricting development of
 
05:39:08.208 --> 05:39:08.218 align:start position:0%
Renewables solar in particular to one
 
05:39:10.310 --> 05:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
megawatt forces the all of the
 
05:39:12.948 --> 05:39:12.958 align:start position:0%
interconnection costs to be borne by a
 
05:39:15.890 --> 05:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
very relatively small project and this
 
05:39:18.110 --> 05:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
Committee in this legislature and its
 
05:39:18.120 --> 05:39:19.190 align:start position:0%
Committee in this legislature and its
wisdom

05:39:19.190 --> 05:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
wisdom
 
05:39:21.110 --> 05:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
remove that restriction for
 
05:39:23.810 --> 05:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
municipalities because everyone lives in
 
05:39:26.270 --> 05:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
a municipality well as representative
 
05:39:29.150 --> 05:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
Mudd said you know New Hampshire so much
 
05:39:32.208 --> 05:39:32.218 align:start position:0%
of our economy is various non-profits
 
05:39:34.850 --> 05:39:34.860 align:start position:0%
large and small from YMCAs to
 
05:39:37.990 --> 05:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
you know you name it and uh
 
05:39:41.930 --> 05:39:41.940 align:start position:0%
this would again it's just nothing free
 
05:39:44.448 --> 05:39:44.458 align:start position:0%
about this Market we set the rules and
 
05:39:47.570 --> 05:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
this this one megawatt limitation on the
 
05:39:49.670 --> 05:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
scale of
 
05:39:51.530 --> 05:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
renewable generation that's allowed to
 
05:39:53.690 --> 05:39:53.700 align:start position:0%
interconnect is is what's holding us
 
05:39:53.700 --> 05:39:55.010 align:start position:0%
interconnect is is what's holding us
back

05:39:55.010 --> 05:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
back
 
05:39:56.510 --> 05:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
um these projects are done through
 
05:39:58.550 --> 05:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
private investment not public
 
05:40:01.250 --> 05:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
and so I think that this bill has a lot
 
05:40:05.208 --> 05:40:05.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:07.788 --> 05:40:07.798 align:start position:0%
further comment
 
05:40:10.070 --> 05:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
I'd point out that
 
05:40:13.128 --> 05:40:13.138 align:start position:0%
the municipal host carve out that we
 
05:40:17.690 --> 05:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:22.250 --> 05:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
benefits taxpayers and it's also uh some
 
05:40:24.470 --> 05:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
under under the control of taxpayers
 
05:40:26.750 --> 05:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
because they control their Municipal
 
05:40:26.760 --> 05:40:28.070 align:start position:0%
because they control their Municipal
spending

05:40:28.070 --> 05:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
spending
 
05:40:32.208 --> 05:40:32.218 align:start position:0%
and so if they choose
 
05:40:34.850 --> 05:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
the benefits that they reap from being
 
05:40:37.430 --> 05:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
part of a municipal host program
 
05:40:40.150 --> 05:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
they can choose to use that money
 
05:40:43.070 --> 05:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
however they like
 
05:40:46.010 --> 05:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
and so they have some control over it
 
05:40:49.670 --> 05:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
turning groups into of non-profits into
 
05:40:53.150 --> 05:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:58.368 --> 05:40:58.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:59.930 --> 05:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
the benefits
 
05:41:03.770 --> 05:41:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:03.780 --> 05:41:05.868 align:start position:0%
 
except

05:41:05.868 --> 05:41:05.878 align:start position:0%
except
 
05:41:09.550 --> 05:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
how the non-profit wants to use it so it
 
05:41:12.590 --> 05:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
provides less
 
05:41:15.708 --> 05:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
public benefit than being a municipal
 
05:41:18.650 --> 05:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
host provides and it seems to me that
 
05:41:21.890 --> 05:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
it's ripe for abuse and that would be
 
05:41:23.448 --> 05:41:23.458 align:start position:0%
another reason why I couldn't really
 
05:41:26.868 --> 05:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
support something like this without some
 
05:41:31.610 --> 05:41:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:33.590 --> 05:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
anybody else have anything else to say
 
05:41:35.208 --> 05:41:35.218 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas you might
 
05:41:38.090 --> 05:41:38.100 align:start position:0%
want to turn your microphone off oh
 
05:41:38.100 --> 05:41:39.530 align:start position:0%
want to turn your microphone off oh
okay

05:41:39.530 --> 05:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:41:42.110 --> 05:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
let's move on Senate Bill 79 this is the
 
05:41:44.270 --> 05:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
same kind of Bill as Senate Bill 69
 
05:41:48.230 --> 05:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
except it talks about industrial hosts
 
05:41:49.910 --> 05:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
05:41:53.448 --> 05:41:53.458 align:start position:0%
non-profit hosts and I think It suffers
 
05:41:56.330 --> 05:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
from many of the same problems that
 
05:41:58.310 --> 05:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
the previous bill that we just discussed
 
05:42:01.128 --> 05:42:01.138 align:start position:0%
suffers from and for that reason I
 
05:42:03.110 --> 05:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't support it even though it's
 
05:42:05.030 --> 05:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
supported by the business and industry
 
05:42:05.040 --> 05:42:06.470 align:start position:0%
supported by the business and industry
Association

05:42:06.470 --> 05:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
Association
 
05:42:09.410 --> 05:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit baffled by that one but
 
05:42:09.420 --> 05:42:10.190 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit baffled by that one but
um

05:42:10.190 --> 05:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:16.730 --> 05:42:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:19.010 --> 05:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
well it appears Wendy representative
 
05:42:22.190 --> 05:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas says thank you um so
 
05:42:24.830 --> 05:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
your your objection to these this bill
 
05:42:26.810 --> 05:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
and the previous one is there's no guard
 
05:42:28.788 --> 05:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
rails I mean should we be considering
 
05:42:30.770 --> 05:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
guard rails for these to make them
 
05:42:33.110 --> 05:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
stronger bills
 
05:42:36.590 --> 05:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
we could certainly consider it
 
05:42:36.600 --> 05:42:37.190 align:start position:0%
we could certainly consider it
um

05:42:37.190 --> 05:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:39.590 --> 05:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
it might require retaining those bills
 
05:42:42.288 --> 05:42:42.298 align:start position:0%
in order to do so but I'm a little bit
 
05:42:43.730 --> 05:42:43.740 align:start position:0%
reluctant to retain bills because we
 
05:42:46.490 --> 05:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
already have 13 of them well but I mean
 
05:42:49.128 --> 05:42:49.138 align:start position:0%
if we if if it if it means we we put out
 
05:42:51.708 --> 05:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
a good bill or a strong bill
 
05:42:53.750 --> 05:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
so your objection to both of these are
 
05:42:56.510 --> 05:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
our guard rails essentially
 
05:42:57.948 --> 05:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
yeah there's no
 
05:42:57.958 --> 05:43:00.050 align:start position:0%
yeah there's no
uh

05:43:00.050 --> 05:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:43:02.750 --> 05:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
Assurance built into the bill that the
 
05:43:05.150 --> 05:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
program how fast the programmer will
 
05:43:08.750 --> 05:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
grow how big the program will grow
 
05:43:11.690 --> 05:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
it's it's open-ended and
 
05:43:18.350 --> 05:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:20.510 --> 05:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative McGee
 
05:43:23.150 --> 05:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so
 
05:43:25.910 --> 05:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
um on the on SB 79 which is the bill at
 
05:43:25.920 --> 05:43:26.930 align:start position:0%
um on the on SB 79 which is the bill at
hand

05:43:26.930 --> 05:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
hand
 
05:43:29.930 --> 05:43:29.940 align:start position:0%
um I felt felt that the testimony from
 
05:43:31.730 --> 05:43:31.740 align:start position:0%
both hitchner and Stonyfield was
 
05:43:33.350 --> 05:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
extremely compelling and what we were
 
05:43:37.010 --> 05:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
hearing from them is just as with sb69
 
05:43:40.670 --> 05:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
these are folks that have exorbitant
 
05:43:43.010 --> 05:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
energy bills right so there's the so
 
05:43:46.730 --> 05:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
when prices go up 50 or 100 percent the
 
05:43:48.530 --> 05:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
impact is very significant both on
 
05:43:51.948 --> 05:43:51.958 align:start position:0%
non-profits and on uh for-profit large
 
05:43:55.128 --> 05:43:55.138 align:start position:0%
operations so I I heard their testimony
 
05:43:57.288 --> 05:43:57.298 align:start position:0%
as asking us to pay attention to that
 
05:43:59.628 --> 05:43:59.638 align:start position:0%
and to try and figure out a way to allow
 
05:44:01.850 --> 05:44:01.860 align:start position:0%
them to help themselves right they can
 
05:44:04.788 --> 05:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
make an investment but they also have
 
05:44:06.948 --> 05:44:06.958 align:start position:0%
all of the capital costs and even though
 
05:44:09.410 --> 05:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
they will reap the benefits it's it's
 
05:44:10.788 --> 05:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
it's hard for them to make the
 
05:44:12.530 --> 05:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
Investments at the right at the
 
05:44:14.448 --> 05:44:14.458 align:start position:0%
appropriate scale because they're not
 
05:44:16.070 --> 05:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
going to be compensated for the energy
 
05:44:18.288 --> 05:44:18.298 align:start position:0%
that they produce at a rate to measure
 
05:44:19.910 --> 05:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
it with what its actual value would be
 
05:44:21.410 --> 05:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
in the market so that's all they're
 
05:44:23.448 --> 05:44:23.458 align:start position:0%
asking us to do is to allow them to
 
05:44:26.628 --> 05:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
participate in you know creating some
 
05:44:28.128 --> 05:44:28.138 align:start position:0%
local generation which which I think is
 
05:44:30.128 --> 05:44:30.138 align:start position:0%
a benefit to this system
 
05:44:32.448 --> 05:44:32.458 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't really view it the
 
05:44:34.788 --> 05:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
same way as some others that have spoken
 
05:44:37.788 --> 05:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
here and I think that as was mentioned
 
05:44:37.798 --> 05:44:38.810 align:start position:0%
here and I think that as was mentioned
before

05:44:38.810 --> 05:44:38.820 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:44:41.448 --> 05:44:41.458 align:start position:0%
if it's a hospital or YMCA or other
 
05:44:43.430 --> 05:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
large organization with big facilities
 
05:44:45.650 --> 05:44:45.660 align:start position:0%
and they get to save on their bill and
 
05:44:47.030 --> 05:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
they get to generate their own energy
 
05:44:49.910 --> 05:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
they're also helping us lower demand you
 
05:44:52.010 --> 05:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
know so the conversations we had earlier
 
05:44:53.390 --> 05:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
in the day about how we're worried about
 
05:44:54.770 --> 05:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
Peak and where we're going to get it
 
05:44:57.350 --> 05:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
from if the more we allow people to
 
05:44:58.788 --> 05:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
invest in New Hampshire the more energy
 
05:45:01.010 --> 05:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
independent we become so
 
05:45:03.048 --> 05:45:03.058 align:start position:0%
I think we have to start looking at that
 
05:45:05.150 --> 05:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
because the testimony that we had that
 
05:45:07.548 --> 05:45:07.558 align:start position:0%
day on SP 79
 
05:45:12.350 --> 05:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
was clear cogent compelling I mean I
 
05:45:14.990 --> 05:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't see any reason to to deny them
 
05:45:17.270 --> 05:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
what they were asking for from us I
 
05:45:19.910 --> 05:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
thought it was eminently reasonable in
 
05:45:21.890 --> 05:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
the environment that we're in which is
 
05:45:23.690 --> 05:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
that prices have gone up significantly
 
05:45:25.670 --> 05:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
and they're impacting everybody every
 
05:45:28.788 --> 05:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
sector so since we don't have an overall
 
05:45:30.530 --> 05:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
energy policy that allows them to
 
05:45:32.570 --> 05:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
participate and have it become an
 
05:45:34.128 --> 05:45:34.138 align:start position:0%
economically reasonable investment for
 
05:45:36.230 --> 05:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
them they're saying carve it out for us
 
05:45:38.330 --> 05:45:38.340 align:start position:0%
and I agree with you I don't want I
 
05:45:40.430 --> 05:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to see it be all one-offs I
 
05:45:41.868 --> 05:45:41.878 align:start position:0%
don't think that's the way to do it but
 
05:45:44.208 --> 05:45:44.218 align:start position:0%
that's where we are because we don't we
 
05:45:45.948 --> 05:45:45.958 align:start position:0%
don't allow people to invest over one
 
05:45:45.958 --> 05:45:46.910 align:start position:0%
don't allow people to invest over one
megawatt

05:45:46.910 --> 05:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
megawatt
 
05:45:49.548 --> 05:45:49.558 align:start position:0%
and get reimbursed what's interesting
 
05:45:52.250 --> 05:45:52.260 align:start position:0%
about your argument is that
 
05:45:54.288 --> 05:45:54.298 align:start position:0%
we don't prevent people from making
 
05:45:56.208 --> 05:45:56.218 align:start position:0%
Investments over one megawatt if they
 
05:45:57.470 --> 05:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
want to make investments over one
 
05:45:59.390 --> 05:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
megawatt they can
 
05:46:01.430 --> 05:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
they can make it today right they don't
 
05:46:03.110 --> 05:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
need any additional help from from us
 
05:46:04.910 --> 05:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
well I think to make that the argument
 
05:46:06.770 --> 05:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
has been that it's non-economical for
 
05:46:08.030 --> 05:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
them to make the investment because
 
05:46:09.770 --> 05:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
that's where the price point is that
 
05:46:12.530 --> 05:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
they end up you know seeing the the
 
05:46:14.628 --> 05:46:14.638 align:start position:0%
benefits of the investment which is what
 
05:46:17.330 --> 05:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
any investment investor is looking for
 
05:46:19.490 --> 05:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
right is where's the break point when am
 
05:46:20.750 --> 05:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
I going to recover my money what's the
 
05:46:23.628 --> 05:46:23.638 align:start position:0%
return on investment so it it becomes
 
05:46:26.330 --> 05:46:26.340 align:start position:0%
non-economical and therefore people it's
 
05:46:28.010 --> 05:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
depressed the Market's depressed right
 
05:46:29.208 --> 05:46:29.218 align:start position:0%
people are not going to make the
 
05:46:30.650 --> 05:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
investment because it just doesn't make
 
05:46:32.330 --> 05:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
economic sense
 
05:46:34.910 --> 05:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
05:46:37.310 --> 05:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
yeah this is just another car vote we
 
05:46:39.470 --> 05:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
started with this was being one megawatt
 
05:46:41.628 --> 05:46:41.638 align:start position:0%
only then we went up to five and we said
 
05:46:44.030 --> 05:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
it was okay for municipals then we just
 
05:46:46.850 --> 05:46:46.860 align:start position:0%
talked about uh non-profits and now
 
05:46:48.708 --> 05:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
we're talking about corporations and as
 
05:46:50.208 --> 05:46:50.218 align:start position:0%
you said there's nothing that prevents
 
05:46:52.190 --> 05:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
they can make a 10 megawatt system if
 
05:46:53.930 --> 05:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
they want to there's nothing preventing
 
05:46:55.548 --> 05:46:55.558 align:start position:0%
them from doing that they could invest
 
05:46:57.708 --> 05:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
in storage and use 100 of their
 
05:46:59.628 --> 05:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
electricity but instead they wanted to
 
05:47:01.850 --> 05:47:01.860 align:start position:0%
take the easy route out and sell it back
 
05:47:05.390 --> 05:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
to uh the utility at an inflated price
 
05:47:06.890 --> 05:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
because it's not what it's worth because
 
05:47:09.048 --> 05:47:09.058 align:start position:0%
they don't have any obligation to serve
 
05:47:12.110 --> 05:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
so they can put out three and a half
 
05:47:14.510 --> 05:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
four megawatts on a Sunday morning a
 
05:47:16.250 --> 05:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
bright Sunday morning in May when no one
 
05:47:18.048 --> 05:47:18.058 align:start position:0%
really needs the power and the prices
 
05:47:20.750 --> 05:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
the wholesale price is very low but
 
05:47:21.830 --> 05:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
they're still going to get paid the
 
05:47:24.948 --> 05:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
higher rate and in another time on a
 
05:47:27.170 --> 05:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
cold Winter's day they can produce
 
05:47:29.330 --> 05:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
nothing and there's no penalty so to say
 
05:47:31.430 --> 05:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
this is the same is PR as regular power
 
05:47:34.730 --> 05:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
is is just isn't true there's no one's
 
05:47:37.070 --> 05:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
this stuff is worth substantially less
 
05:47:39.948 --> 05:47:39.958 align:start position:0%
than say the default Service uh you get
 
05:47:42.230 --> 05:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
from a utility because you turn on the
 
05:47:43.490 --> 05:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
lights and they're supposed to come on
 
05:47:45.830 --> 05:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
and the utility has a contract with
 
05:47:48.230 --> 05:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
someone to provide electricity 24 7.
 
05:47:50.150 --> 05:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
these people don't have contracts with
 
05:47:51.948 --> 05:47:51.958 align:start position:0%
anybody they can produce as much of as
 
05:47:53.330 --> 05:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
little power as they want the only
 
05:47:54.948 --> 05:47:54.958 align:start position:0%
obligation is whenever they decide to do
 
05:47:56.448 --> 05:47:56.458 align:start position:0%
it someone has to buy it and pay an
 
05:47:59.330 --> 05:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
inflated price so carve out after Cabo
 
05:48:00.230 --> 05:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
pretty soon we're going to have
 
05:48:02.868 --> 05:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
everybody can do five megawatts and then
 
05:48:04.430 --> 05:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
it's really going to start shifting
 
05:48:06.048 --> 05:48:06.058 align:start position:0%
costs and it won't be any need to use
 
05:48:08.150 --> 05:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
the electricity just be like many little
 
05:48:10.850 --> 05:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
generators and that'll really Drive our
 
05:48:12.730 --> 05:48:12.740 align:start position:0%
costs up
 
05:48:15.170 --> 05:48:15.180 align:start position:0%

05:48:16.670 --> 05:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
closure
 
05:48:21.590 --> 05:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just looking over
 
05:48:21.600 --> 05:48:22.548 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just looking over
um

05:48:22.548 --> 05:48:22.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:25.910 --> 05:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
Mr Roberts from the Department of energy
 
05:48:29.868 --> 05:48:29.878 align:start position:0%
brought on the fact that we're repealing
 
05:48:33.048 --> 05:48:33.058 align:start position:0%
the the present eligible consumer
 
05:48:35.750 --> 05:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
generator and just redefining it and
 
05:48:38.628 --> 05:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
expanding it to far more than what it
 
05:48:40.490 --> 05:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
was that's the main thing it is what
 
05:48:43.368 --> 05:48:43.378 align:start position:0%
this bill does it redefines
 
05:48:47.110 --> 05:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh eligible customer
 
05:48:50.208 --> 05:48:50.218 align:start position:0%
generator thank you
 
05:48:51.890 --> 05:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
good point
 
05:48:54.170 --> 05:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
representative Summers
 
05:48:56.690 --> 05:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman actually I'm just
 
05:48:58.070 --> 05:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
actually picking up on some of the
 
05:48:59.208 --> 05:48:59.218 align:start position:0%
things that have been said here and I've
 
05:49:01.128 --> 05:49:01.138 align:start position:0%
just made me wonder that uh we've all
 
05:49:04.128 --> 05:49:04.138 align:start position:0%
looking at 69 and 79 non-profit
 
05:49:06.470 --> 05:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
we already carved out like you like
 
05:49:07.910 --> 05:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
um representative Harrington said we
 
05:49:10.970 --> 05:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
already carved out municipalities 69 ads
 
05:49:13.850 --> 05:49:13.860 align:start position:0%
not would add non-profits to it 79 ads
 
05:49:13.860 --> 05:49:15.288 align:start position:0%
not would add non-profits to it 79 ads
Industries

05:49:15.288 --> 05:49:15.298 align:start position:0%
Industries
 
05:49:17.810 --> 05:49:17.820 align:start position:0%
who would not who would not be allowed
 
05:49:20.330 --> 05:49:20.340 align:start position:0%
to have net metering of all these paths
 
05:49:22.850 --> 05:49:22.860 align:start position:0%
that's my question might be like
 
05:49:26.270 --> 05:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
everybody would be able to good question
 
05:49:29.570 --> 05:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you
 
05:49:33.110 --> 05:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
um so we as as we learn things we're
 
05:49:36.410 --> 05:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
redefining uh terms and and conditions
 
05:49:38.810 --> 05:49:38.820 align:start position:0%
might this not be seen as the evolution
 
05:49:42.048 --> 05:49:42.058 align:start position:0%
of the energy process in the in in New
 
05:49:43.490 --> 05:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I mean isn't this what we're
 
05:49:46.310 --> 05:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:48.048 --> 05:49:48.058 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing
 
05:49:48.058 --> 05:49:49.490 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing
right

05:49:49.490 --> 05:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:49:54.110 --> 05:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:56.448 --> 05:49:56.458 align:start position:0%
well learning and growing it would be a
 
05:50:00.410 --> 05:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
valid criteria and as I indicated in my
 
05:50:01.910 --> 05:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
initial comments I met a few minutes ago
 
05:50:03.530 --> 05:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
about 69
 
05:50:05.750 --> 05:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's all about managing growth in my
 
05:50:08.628 --> 05:50:08.638 align:start position:0%
judgment and this is not a good way to
 
05:50:10.548 --> 05:50:10.558 align:start position:0%
management growth to throw it open to
 
05:50:13.490 --> 05:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
anybody and everybody so that's why I
 
05:50:16.910 --> 05:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
would oppose this kind of approach
 
05:50:19.368 --> 05:50:19.378 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
05:50:22.310 --> 05:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chair I'd like to I think I
 
05:50:23.570 --> 05:50:23.580 align:start position:0%
might have indicated this before I
 
05:50:25.250 --> 05:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
really don't see this as anything more
 
05:50:27.770 --> 05:50:27.780 align:start position:0%
than a good job bill it's good business
 
05:50:30.410 --> 05:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
for us to raise the limit to five
 
05:50:32.628 --> 05:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
megawatts so companies like Ann Houser
 
05:50:34.788 --> 05:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
Bush can produce more of their own
 
05:50:36.890 --> 05:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
electric and not have to lay off
 
05:50:39.350 --> 05:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
employees and send money out of state
 
05:50:41.390 --> 05:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
let's keep the money in state and let's
 
05:50:43.070 --> 05:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
keep our employees working
 
05:50:45.230 --> 05:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
I think it's pretty cut and dried as far
 
05:50:47.510 --> 05:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
as I can say and I have to agree with a
 
05:50:50.030 --> 05:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative of Summers
 
05:50:51.890 --> 05:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
I get tired of the car abouts too I
 
05:50:53.570 --> 05:50:53.580 align:start position:0%
think it'd be far easier for me to raise
 
05:50:55.970 --> 05:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
the entire uh limit to five megawatts
 
05:51:00.410 --> 05:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:02.750 --> 05:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative Carmen thank you Mr
 
05:51:02.760 --> 05:51:03.650 align:start position:0%
representative Carmen thank you Mr
chairman

05:51:03.650 --> 05:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:51:05.510 --> 05:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
um there it seems to me there is a bit
 
05:51:06.830 --> 05:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
of a guard rail on this one right
 
05:51:08.750 --> 05:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
because it says in no instance shall the
 
05:51:10.670 --> 05:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
electrical generating facility exceed
 
05:51:12.770 --> 05:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
100 of the industrial host's average
 
05:51:14.570 --> 05:51:14.580 align:start position:0%
electric consumption over the past 12
 
05:51:16.910 --> 05:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
months so there there is a bit of a
 
05:51:18.948 --> 05:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
limit and after after that then then
 
05:51:21.530 --> 05:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
they're getting a wholesale for it
 
05:51:23.510 --> 05:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
you're right there is a little bit of a
 
05:51:26.090 --> 05:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
guardrail on this one and my judgment is
 
05:51:28.610 --> 05:51:28.620 align:start position:0%
not nearly big enough but
 
05:51:31.610 --> 05:51:31.620 align:start position:0%
additional comments
 
05:51:35.208 --> 05:51:35.218 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you um
 
05:51:37.010 --> 05:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
I don't have the answer to this so I'm
 
05:51:38.990 --> 05:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
throwing it out to the committee but um
 
05:51:41.448 --> 05:51:41.458 align:start position:0%
with the existing carbs out is there any
 
05:51:45.410 --> 05:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:47.690 --> 05:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
I mean do we do multiple host you mean
 
05:51:52.490 --> 05:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
yes well there was uh not Crossing
 
05:51:56.030 --> 05:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
Municipal boundaries was a
 
05:51:58.430 --> 05:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
was one of the guardrails but we've done
 
05:52:01.548 --> 05:52:01.558 align:start position:0%
away with that right right so so this
 
05:52:03.110 --> 05:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
these wouldn't be as self-regulating
 
05:52:06.170 --> 05:52:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:07.970 --> 05:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
05:52:10.548 --> 05:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
again I just want to say that it's just
 
05:52:11.930 --> 05:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
to say that there's a guardrail or a
 
05:52:14.270 --> 05:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
limit because they could only uh do up
 
05:52:16.010 --> 05:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
to the maximum amount that they consume
 
05:52:18.110 --> 05:52:18.120 align:start position:0%
in a year doesn't deal with the reality
 
05:52:20.510 --> 05:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
of the markets they can be producing in
 
05:52:22.250 --> 05:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
fact they probably would produce the
 
05:52:25.128 --> 05:52:25.138 align:start position:0%
maximum amount of their solar output
 
05:52:27.530 --> 05:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
would be in the month of May probably
 
05:52:31.128 --> 05:52:31.138 align:start position:0%
the first half of May and two sevenths
 
05:52:32.510 --> 05:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
of that is going to come on Saturdays
 
05:52:34.970 --> 05:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
and Sundays during very low demand days
 
05:52:37.128 --> 05:52:37.138 align:start position:0%
because it's weekends and even on the
 
05:52:38.628 --> 05:52:38.638 align:start position:0%
weekday in May typically that's
 
05:52:40.190 --> 05:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
considered that's when we shut down the
 
05:52:42.110 --> 05:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
nuclear plants for refueling Etc because
 
05:52:44.750 --> 05:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
demand for electricity is lowest then so
 
05:52:46.430 --> 05:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
the value is the lowest so they're going
 
05:52:48.110 --> 05:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
to be producing the maximum amount when
 
05:52:50.628 --> 05:52:50.638 align:start position:0%
the value is the lowest and again that's
 
05:52:54.230 --> 05:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:57.288 --> 05:52:57.298 align:start position:0%
so I'm sensing that we're kind of split
 
05:52:59.510 --> 05:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
on this these two bills representative
 
05:53:02.628 --> 05:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
McGee yeah just a last thought I I feel
 
05:53:04.010 --> 05:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
like we're going back and litigating
 
05:53:05.628 --> 05:53:05.638 align:start position:0%
some conversations that we've had in the
 
05:53:08.390 --> 05:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
past and it comes down to
 
05:53:08.400 --> 05:53:08.990 align:start position:0%
past and it comes down to
um

05:53:08.990 --> 05:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:13.070 --> 05:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
you know not letting this Market do
 
05:53:14.628 --> 05:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
whatever it would do based on a free
 
05:53:17.390 --> 05:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
market because of a concern for any
 
05:53:20.650 --> 05:53:20.660 align:start position:0%
shifting of costs right isn't that
 
05:53:23.090 --> 05:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
where where you come down in terms of
 
05:53:25.010 --> 05:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
opposing the idea of people making their
 
05:53:26.330 --> 05:53:26.340 align:start position:0%
own Investments for their own energy
 
05:53:29.208 --> 05:53:29.218 align:start position:0%
needs and giving them the latitude to do
 
05:53:31.850 --> 05:53:31.860 align:start position:0%
that and be paid for the energy that
 
05:53:34.730 --> 05:53:34.740 align:start position:0%
they're generating at a reasonable rate
 
05:53:36.650 --> 05:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
um you know to to recover those those
 
05:53:38.868 --> 05:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
Capital costs
 
05:53:41.510 --> 05:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
um it's it's more out of a concern that
 
05:53:42.890 --> 05:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
somebody else is going to have to pay
 
05:53:45.350 --> 05:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
for that or subsidize that
 
05:53:49.010 --> 05:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
um and I I don't I think that the vder
 
05:53:51.230 --> 05:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
study that we just got shows us that
 
05:53:53.868 --> 05:53:53.878 align:start position:0%
even out to 2035 we're really not
 
05:53:56.448 --> 05:53:56.458 align:start position:0%
looking at any significant cost shifts
 
05:53:57.948 --> 05:53:57.958 align:start position:0%
and so I'm wondering if we should still
 
05:54:01.128 --> 05:54:01.138 align:start position:0%
be laboring under that perception that
 
05:54:02.690 --> 05:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
that is something that we're supposed to
 
05:54:04.730 --> 05:54:04.740 align:start position:0%
be managing for when people are
 
05:54:06.650 --> 05:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
desperately asking us to help them
 
05:54:09.948 --> 05:54:09.958 align:start position:0%
manage their energy costs right now
 
05:54:12.288 --> 05:54:12.298 align:start position:0%
well I think representative McGee that
 
05:54:14.208 --> 05:54:14.218 align:start position:0%
you hit on the the
 
05:54:16.730 --> 05:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
crucial part of this question and that
 
05:54:19.730 --> 05:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
is what's the what's a reasonable cost
 
05:54:23.090 --> 05:54:23.100 align:start position:0%
and the current uh docket that's open in
 
05:54:25.610 --> 05:54:25.620 align:start position:0%
front of the puc is looking into that
 
05:54:28.250 --> 05:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
very question trying to decide what
 
05:54:31.190 --> 05:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
should be a reasonable cost for the net
 
05:54:33.530 --> 05:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
metering tariff going forward that's
 
05:54:35.448 --> 05:54:35.458 align:start position:0%
another reason I think that bills like
 
05:54:39.170 --> 05:54:39.180 align:start position:0%
six SB 69 and SB 79 should be set aside
 
05:54:42.230 --> 05:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
until we know what the cost is going to
 
05:54:45.350 --> 05:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
be based on whatever net metering tariff
 
05:54:48.230 --> 05:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
gets developed out of that docket
 
05:54:52.250 --> 05:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:54.770 --> 05:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
we either could be setting ourselves up
 
05:54:57.890 --> 05:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
for huge cost increases or we could be
 
05:55:00.530 --> 05:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
creating opportunities that are
 
05:55:02.030 --> 05:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
non-existent which are going to give
 
05:55:05.628 --> 05:55:05.638 align:start position:0%
people false hope so I think it would be
 
05:55:08.030 --> 05:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
prudent just to push these
 
05:55:10.910 --> 05:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation aside until we
 
05:55:12.770 --> 05:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
know what a future net meter in tariff
 
05:55:14.270 --> 05:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
is going to look like
 
05:55:17.208 --> 05:55:17.218 align:start position:0%
and just so you know I I had that
 
05:55:19.070 --> 05:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
conversation I think when
 
05:55:22.690 --> 05:55:22.700 align:start position:0%
um when Mr Roberge was in the hot seat
 
05:55:26.868 --> 05:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
with him that I I actually see
 
05:55:29.150 --> 05:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
um correct rate setting of The Tariff
 
05:55:32.570 --> 05:55:32.580 align:start position:0%
for net metering as uh
 
05:55:35.030 --> 05:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
separate red herring type of an issue
 
05:55:37.910 --> 05:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
because if it's set correctly sometime
 
05:55:39.890 --> 05:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
in the future it it doesn't make any
 
05:55:41.510 --> 05:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
difference it just means that the rate
 
05:55:43.128 --> 05:55:43.138 align:start position:0%
that a person will be paid will change
 
05:55:45.230 --> 05:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
commiserate with that new information
 
05:55:47.330 --> 05:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't have anything to do with
 
05:55:49.670 --> 05:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
us passing uh net metering policy today
 
05:55:51.530 --> 05:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
and I don't think it should
 
05:55:53.448 --> 05:55:53.458 align:start position:0%
uh be delayed because of something
 
05:55:55.368 --> 05:55:55.378 align:start position:0%
that's that's separate and distinct
 
05:55:57.288 --> 05:55:57.298 align:start position:0%
which is what the value of the energy is
 
05:56:00.128 --> 05:56:00.138 align:start position:0%
not whether you have the ability to
 
05:56:03.470 --> 05:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
recover that value
 
05:56:05.448 --> 05:56:05.458 align:start position:0%
well I hear from my constituents that a
 
05:56:06.948 --> 05:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
lot of them are uncomfortable buying
 
05:56:08.090 --> 05:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
things that they don't know what they
 
05:56:10.548 --> 05:56:10.558 align:start position:0%
cost so they want to wait to see what it
 
05:56:12.530 --> 05:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
costs before they say yes to buying
 
05:56:12.540 --> 05:56:14.270 align:start position:0%
costs before they say yes to buying
something

05:56:14.270 --> 05:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:56:16.190 --> 05:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
any further combats representative Doug
 
05:56:18.410 --> 05:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair I would have
 
05:56:22.788 --> 05:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
to agree uh with the comments um to wait
 
05:56:25.430 --> 05:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
and see what happens with the puc but
 
05:56:27.288 --> 05:56:27.298 align:start position:0%
the one thing I'd like to State here is
 
05:56:29.330 --> 05:56:29.340 align:start position:0%
I I would like for everyone here to be
 
05:56:34.250 --> 05:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
very cautious in using the term that we
 
05:56:38.810 --> 05:56:38.820 align:start position:0%
need to allow people to you know be able
 
05:56:41.150 --> 05:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
to go up to five megawatts like the
 
05:56:43.190 --> 05:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
chair set here nothing prevents them
 
05:56:45.288 --> 05:56:45.298 align:start position:0%
from from doing that I think the thought
 
05:56:47.030 --> 05:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
we want to get through is if we want to
 
05:56:50.208 --> 05:56:50.218 align:start position:0%
say that we want to say that you know we
 
05:56:52.310 --> 05:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
want we want people to be able to go up
 
05:56:55.208 --> 05:56:55.218 align:start position:0%
to five megawatts by getting subsidies
 
05:56:57.890 --> 05:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
and so I think that's the point that I
 
05:56:59.448 --> 05:56:59.458 align:start position:0%
want to get across here is that we
 
05:57:01.730 --> 05:57:01.740 align:start position:0%
they're they're allowed to go up up to
 
05:57:03.890 --> 05:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
five megawatts if they can't afford to
 
05:57:05.690 --> 05:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
do that that's part of the market but
 
05:57:07.128 --> 05:57:07.138 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about here is
 
05:57:10.010 --> 05:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
subsidies versus we're not Banning or
 
05:57:11.990 --> 05:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
allowing or disallowing anyone to go any
 
05:57:14.208 --> 05:57:14.218 align:start position:0%
any higher up up to five megawatts it's
 
05:57:16.970 --> 05:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
so it's the whole question is what what
 
05:57:18.470 --> 05:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
do they get out of it back and that's
 
05:57:20.448 --> 05:57:20.458 align:start position:0%
the whole issue right here so I just
 
05:57:24.830 --> 05:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:27.350 --> 05:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds
 
05:57:29.570 --> 05:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I I can't let
 
05:57:31.788 --> 05:57:31.798 align:start position:0%
that point go without pushing back on it
 
05:57:31.798 --> 05:57:32.930 align:start position:0%
that point go without pushing back on it
uh

05:57:32.930 --> 05:57:32.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:57:35.208 --> 05:57:35.218 align:start position:0%
the whole debate here of course comes
 
05:57:37.310 --> 05:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
down to the net metering rate
 
05:57:37.320 --> 05:57:38.810 align:start position:0%
down to the net metering rate
and

05:57:38.810 --> 05:57:38.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:57:41.208 --> 05:57:41.218 align:start position:0%
the value of
 
05:57:43.788 --> 05:57:43.798 align:start position:0%
distributed energy study long-awaited
 
05:57:45.948 --> 05:57:45.958 align:start position:0%
multiple years awaited came back and
 
05:57:47.868 --> 05:57:47.878 align:start position:0%
said there was a less than one percent
 
05:57:50.330 --> 05:57:50.340 align:start position:0%
cost shift and that less than one
 
05:57:51.650 --> 05:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
percent was
 
05:57:53.510 --> 05:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
under the
 
05:57:55.730 --> 05:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
worst case assumptions
 
05:57:59.750 --> 05:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
so there's no cost shift by
 
05:58:02.448 --> 05:58:02.458 align:start position:0%
paying for net metered energy at the
 
05:58:03.670 --> 05:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
retail rate
 
05:58:06.048 --> 05:58:06.058 align:start position:0%
back to representative Harrington's
 
05:58:08.150 --> 05:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
comments first of all the peak
 
05:58:12.288 --> 05:58:12.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:15.530 --> 05:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
nope not wrong and uh
 
05:58:18.650 --> 05:58:18.660 align:start position:0%
secondly the reason that it's not a cost
 
05:58:20.930 --> 05:58:20.940 align:start position:0%
shift the reason that it deserves to be
 
05:58:22.970 --> 05:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
paid for at the retail rate and not the
 
05:58:25.010 --> 05:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
wholesale rate is because when net
 
05:58:27.890 --> 05:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
metered energy goes back onto the grid
 
05:58:32.208 --> 05:58:32.218 align:start position:0%
it's already on the grid it goes to the
 
05:58:35.090 --> 05:58:35.100 align:start position:0%
next closest meter where there is demand
 
05:58:35.100 --> 05:58:36.708 align:start position:0%
next closest meter where there is demand
so

05:58:36.708 --> 05:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:58:40.490 --> 05:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
it doesn't incur distribution costs or
 
05:58:42.890 --> 05:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
and it certainly doesn't incur long-term
 
05:58:46.090 --> 05:58:46.100 align:start position:0%
transmission costs so net metered energy
 
05:58:49.070 --> 05:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
meets a key
 
05:58:51.650 --> 05:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
demand in the grid
 
05:58:55.310 --> 05:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's not a huge cost shift
 
05:58:57.650 --> 05:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
and it's not a subsidy to be paying the
 
05:59:00.708 --> 05:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
retail rate for net metered energy
 
05:59:02.750 --> 05:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
05:59:04.610 --> 05:59:04.620 align:start position:0%
yeah first I'll stand by my statement
 
05:59:07.070 --> 05:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
because solar panels the height of solar
 
05:59:09.788 --> 05:59:09.798 align:start position:0%
incidences June 20th in uh New Hampshire
 
05:59:12.650 --> 05:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
and because of the way the panels work
 
05:59:14.628 --> 05:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
when they get high temperatures like in
 
05:59:16.730 --> 05:59:16.740 align:start position:0%
July and August which would be they'll
 
05:59:18.110 --> 05:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
be less efficient and put out less
 
05:59:19.910 --> 05:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
electricity than they would in May where
 
05:59:21.830 --> 05:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's cooler and the solar incidence is
 
05:59:24.110 --> 05:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
exactly the same but the main issue here
 
05:59:26.448 --> 05:59:26.458 align:start position:0%
is if you start we've got it now for we
 
05:59:28.250 --> 05:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
want it for public housing we want it
 
05:59:30.890 --> 05:59:30.900 align:start position:0%
for uh municipalities we wanted for
 
05:59:32.810 --> 05:59:32.820 align:start position:0%
counties now we want it for industrial
 
05:59:34.430 --> 05:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
places you're going to start getting
 
05:59:36.650 --> 05:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of megawatts on
 
05:59:39.310 --> 05:59:39.320 align:start position:0%
the grid with no obligation to deliver
 
05:59:42.530 --> 05:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
and so if the thunderstorm comes in a
 
05:59:44.448 --> 05:59:44.458 align:start position:0%
little bit early or a cold wave comes in
 
05:59:47.390 --> 05:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
and most of the solar drops off by 50
 
05:59:50.330 --> 05:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
percent More Than People expected
 
05:59:52.310 --> 05:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
but we have to get back up power to make
 
05:59:54.830 --> 05:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
up for that there's utilities the iso
 
05:59:56.150 --> 05:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
New England is going to have a
 
05:59:57.650 --> 05:59:57.660 align:start position:0%
increasedly reserved margin
 
05:59:59.868 --> 05:59:59.878 align:start position:0%
substantially because they realize you
 
06:00:02.868 --> 06:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
put four or 500 megawatts on the grid
 
06:00:05.448 --> 06:00:05.458 align:start position:0%
that has no obligation to deliver like a
 
06:00:07.730 --> 06:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
regular generator that creates a lot
 
06:00:09.890 --> 06:00:09.900 align:start position:0%
more uncertainty and everybody wants
 
06:00:11.570 --> 06:00:11.580 align:start position:0%
electricity oops the cold front came in
 
06:00:13.490 --> 06:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
early is not an adequate excuse why your
 
06:00:15.530 --> 06:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
lights don't work so they're going to
 
06:00:17.030 --> 06:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
turn around and say we want more
 
06:00:18.590 --> 06:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
spinning Reserve well they have to pay
 
06:00:20.810 --> 06:00:20.820 align:start position:0%
for the spinning Reserve so the costs go
 
06:00:22.670 --> 06:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
up there's just no other way to look at
 
06:00:24.530 --> 06:00:24.540 align:start position:0%
it when it's a small amount it's
 
06:00:26.030 --> 06:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
negligible the one percent was
 
06:00:28.310 --> 06:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
remembering that report was up to one
 
06:00:30.890 --> 06:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
megawatt of net metering not going to
 
06:00:32.628 --> 06:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
five and certainly not expanding it to
 
06:00:35.030 --> 06:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
any industrial facility in the state
 
06:00:37.070 --> 06:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
that had a load of that could go up to
 
06:00:39.110 --> 06:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
five megawatts so there's a drastically
 
06:00:41.570 --> 06:00:41.580 align:start position:0%
load shifted because as we heard earlier
 
06:00:44.150 --> 06:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
about risk this increases the risk to
 
06:00:46.910 --> 06:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
the supplying utility or the iso New
 
06:00:47.930 --> 06:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
England whoever you want to talk about
 
06:00:49.970 --> 06:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
balancing it because it's simply more
 
06:00:52.070 --> 06:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
more risk involved because these
 
06:00:53.810 --> 06:00:53.820 align:start position:0%
companies do not have an obligation
 
06:00:57.110 --> 06:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
their inverters break on Tuesday maybe
 
06:00:58.368 --> 06:00:58.378 align:start position:0%
they'll fix them Wednesday or Thursday
 
06:00:59.570 --> 06:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
maybe they won't maybe they'll wait
 
06:01:01.730 --> 06:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
three weeks they have no obligation
 
06:01:03.230 --> 06:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
there's no penalty for not delivering
 
06:01:04.730 --> 06:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
the electricity but whenever they do
 
06:01:09.350 --> 06:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:10.910 --> 06:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
I think we can all get a pretty good
 
06:01:13.310 --> 06:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
idea based on the discussion we've just
 
06:01:15.830 --> 06:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
heard over the last 15 20 minutes that
 
06:01:17.990 --> 06:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
we're probably not going to come to any
 
06:01:19.368 --> 06:01:19.378 align:start position:0%
kind of an agreement over these two
 
06:01:19.378 --> 06:01:20.510 align:start position:0%
kind of an agreement over these two
bills

06:01:20.510 --> 06:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
bills
 
06:01:22.970 --> 06:01:22.980 align:start position:0%
nor have we identified any way to
 
06:01:26.330 --> 06:01:26.340 align:start position:0%
improve them I don't think that's
 
06:01:28.368 --> 06:01:28.378 align:start position:0%
basically the purpose of a work session
 
06:01:30.170 --> 06:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
is to look at bills and see if we can
 
06:01:31.970 --> 06:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
wait think of ways to
 
06:01:34.788 --> 06:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
improve them make them better make them
 
06:01:38.208 --> 06:01:38.218 align:start position:0%
work better and I think it likely makes
 
06:01:40.490 --> 06:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
based on the discussion we just had
 
06:01:42.830 --> 06:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
we're not going to make either of these
 
06:01:45.650 --> 06:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
bills any better one way or the other
 
06:01:47.868 --> 06:01:47.878 align:start position:0%
so let's move on to Senate Bill 113
 
06:01:51.470 --> 06:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
relative to cost effectiveness
 
06:01:54.350 --> 06:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
a car relative to cost Effectiveness
 
06:01:56.570 --> 06:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
review of The Joint utility Energy
 
06:01:59.030 --> 06:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
Efficiency plan it's not worded very
 
06:02:01.368 --> 06:02:01.378 align:start position:0%
well but anyway what that means
 
06:02:03.890 --> 06:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
basically is that um
 
06:02:07.070 --> 06:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 113 wanted to add the word
 
06:02:12.230 --> 06:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
annually to the section of law that
 
06:02:15.650 --> 06:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
describes the system benefits charge
 
06:02:19.190 --> 06:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
because the puc interpreted the previous
 
06:02:21.110 --> 06:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
legislation that we passed in House Bill
 
06:02:24.910 --> 06:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
549 as meeting a lifetime and annual
 
06:02:27.230 --> 06:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
Energy savings
 
06:02:29.750 --> 06:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
and this bill clarifies that by saying
 
06:02:32.750 --> 06:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
that it's just annual Energy savings not
 
06:02:32.760 --> 06:02:34.490 align:start position:0%
that it's just annual Energy savings not
lifetime

06:02:34.490 --> 06:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
lifetime
 
06:02:34.500 --> 06:02:35.990 align:start position:0%
lifetime
and

06:02:35.990 --> 06:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:02:39.170 --> 06:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
I think uh it would be reasonable since
 
06:02:40.670 --> 06:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
that was one of the guard rails that was
 
06:02:43.548 --> 06:02:43.558 align:start position:0%
put into HB 549 if we're going to weaken
 
06:02:45.410 --> 06:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
that guardrail we should strengthen the
 
06:02:47.690 --> 06:02:47.700 align:start position:0%
other guardrail so I will be submitting
 
06:02:52.090 --> 06:02:52.100 align:start position:0%
an amendment that removes the
 
06:02:55.128 --> 06:02:55.138 align:start position:0%
0.25 percent adder
 
06:02:58.430 --> 06:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
to the system benefits charge
 
06:02:58.440 --> 06:03:00.350 align:start position:0%
to the system benefits charge
uh

06:03:00.350 --> 06:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:03:00.360 --> 06:03:02.030 align:start position:0%
uh
CPI

06:03:02.030 --> 06:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
CPI
 
06:03:04.090 --> 06:03:04.100 align:start position:0%
adjustment that's made every three years
 
06:03:07.610 --> 06:03:07.620 align:start position:0%
so we'll this amendment will delete that
 
06:03:10.310 --> 06:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
0.25 Adder which will strengthen that
 
06:03:13.610 --> 06:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
guard rail since we're weakening the
 
06:03:16.368 --> 06:03:16.378 align:start position:0%
other guard rail and I think uh that's
 
06:03:18.110 --> 06:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
the kind of an improvement to this bill
 
06:03:19.670 --> 06:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
that would make it acceptable to both
 
06:03:22.490 --> 06:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
sides and we could probably pass that
 
06:03:22.500 --> 06:03:25.368 align:start position:0%
sides and we could probably pass that
unanimously

06:03:25.368 --> 06:03:25.378 align:start position:0%
unanimously
 
06:03:27.830 --> 06:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
I haven't gotten the bill back from OLS
 
06:03:29.810 --> 06:03:29.820 align:start position:0%
it's been filed I haven't checked my
 
06:03:33.110 --> 06:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
email recently but last time I looked it
 
06:03:40.310 --> 06:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:43.610 --> 06:03:43.620 align:start position:0%
and I don't see it yet so I asked for it
 
06:03:46.190 --> 06:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
by three o'clock this afternoon it is
 
06:03:47.990 --> 06:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
three o'clock but
 
06:03:50.628 --> 06:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
not there yet but anyway that's what my
 
06:03:53.750 --> 06:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment will do and uh
 
06:03:57.230 --> 06:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
foreign any comments representative
 
06:03:57.240 --> 06:03:58.850 align:start position:0%
foreign any comments representative
McGee

06:03:58.850 --> 06:03:58.860 align:start position:0%
McGee
 
06:04:01.670 --> 06:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair as we discussed this
 
06:04:04.250 --> 06:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
um I I don't I don't agree that
 
06:04:06.048 --> 06:04:06.058 align:start position:0%
um clarifying that we should have annual
 
06:04:09.048 --> 06:04:09.058 align:start position:0%
in there to explicitly let the puc
 
06:04:10.868 --> 06:04:10.878 align:start position:0%
understand that we don't mean lifetime
 
06:04:13.190 --> 06:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
which no one had ever interpreted it
 
06:04:15.350 --> 06:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
that way before is weakening something
 
06:04:17.510 --> 06:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
so that we have to then make something
 
06:04:20.868 --> 06:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
else stronger but I I think removing the
 
06:04:24.230 --> 06:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
um the adder is not significant enough
 
06:04:26.270 --> 06:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
to hold up the bill I think the bill is
 
06:04:28.730 --> 06:04:28.740 align:start position:0%
is a no-brainer to quote my colleague on
 
06:04:32.390 --> 06:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:35.690 --> 06:04:35.700 align:start position:0%
representative munz thank you so that
 
06:04:38.090 --> 06:04:38.100 align:start position:0%
that change you're proposing in your
 
06:04:40.128 --> 06:04:40.138 align:start position:0%
Amendment it doesn't change the language
 
06:04:42.770 --> 06:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
in this bill per se it affects some
 
06:04:43.970 --> 06:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
other clause
 
06:04:46.070 --> 06:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
yes it is it affects
 
06:04:46.080 --> 06:04:46.730 align:start position:0%
yes it is it affects
um

06:04:46.730 --> 06:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:50.208 --> 06:04:50.218 align:start position:0%
Clause two I believe
 
06:04:53.868 --> 06:04:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:55.910 --> 06:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
is that correct I don't have it right in
 
06:04:57.650 --> 06:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
front of me
 
06:04:59.448 --> 06:04:59.458 align:start position:0%
oh so you're changing another section
 
06:05:01.610 --> 06:05:01.620 align:start position:0%
another paragraph the paragraph right
 
06:05:07.610 --> 06:05:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:09.830 --> 06:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
06:05:13.730 --> 06:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
okay moving on to House Bill a Senate
 
06:05:16.368 --> 06:05:16.378 align:start position:0%
Bill 161 which is relative to low
 
06:05:19.490 --> 06:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
moderate income Community solar projects
 
06:05:23.510 --> 06:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
I had sent you all a an amendment last
 
06:05:25.670 --> 06:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
Friday that was suggested by the
 
06:05:27.230 --> 06:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
06:05:29.390 --> 06:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
and I don't think there's any objection
 
06:05:31.390 --> 06:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
to that it's amendment number
 
06:05:34.190 --> 06:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
1346 h
 
06:05:39.650 --> 06:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:42.110 --> 06:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry this is on 161.
 
06:05:51.770 --> 06:05:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:54.350 --> 06:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
okay we're good to go with that then
 
06:05:57.048 --> 06:05:57.058 align:start position:0%
next step is excuse me what was the
 
06:05:58.730 --> 06:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm trying to get this it's
 
06:05:58.740 --> 06:05:59.770 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm trying to get this it's
amendment

06:05:59.770 --> 06:05:59.780 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:06:02.150 --> 06:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
1346h I sent it to your legislative
 
06:06:07.190 --> 06:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:10.368 --> 06:06:10.378 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't have that
 
06:06:12.770 --> 06:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
it's not in the computer yet did it I
 
06:06:15.048 --> 06:06:15.058 align:start position:0%
don't see it listed
 
06:06:17.448 --> 06:06:17.458 align:start position:0%
we have copies here at all actually I
 
06:06:19.190 --> 06:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
have copies in my desk drawer I can go
 
06:06:20.930 --> 06:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
get them
 
06:06:24.650 --> 06:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
I I have the language here right talks
 
06:06:26.030 --> 06:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
them on to yourselves while I go to my
 
06:06:26.040 --> 06:06:37.548 align:start position:0%
them on to yourselves while I go to my
desk

06:06:37.548 --> 06:06:37.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:40.128 --> 06:06:40.138 align:start position:0%
oh so it adds the rule of order that's
 
06:06:42.650 --> 06:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
that's what the change is okay thank you
 
06:06:42.660 --> 06:07:31.548 align:start position:0%
that's what the change is okay thank you
foreign

06:07:31.548 --> 06:07:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:31.558 --> 06:08:24.230 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:08:24.230 --> 06:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:26.990 --> 06:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
okay we're passing out the paper copy of
 
06:08:31.610 --> 06:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:34.128 --> 06:08:34.138 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman while we're doing on that I
 
06:08:35.570 --> 06:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
had a comment that doesn't pertain to
 
06:08:38.270 --> 06:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment okay uh I'm looking at
 
06:08:40.850 --> 06:08:40.860 align:start position:0%
this in one of the uh caveats in here is
 
06:08:43.310 --> 06:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
that people that can get subsidized for
 
06:08:46.610 --> 06:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
low-income solar make 80 percent of the
 
06:08:49.970 --> 06:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
area area median income and doing a
 
06:08:52.970 --> 06:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
quick look if you take the uh area
 
06:08:54.770 --> 06:08:54.780 align:start position:0%
median income for New Hampshire and
 
06:08:56.208 --> 06:08:56.218 align:start position:0%
adjust it for inflation that was from
 
06:08:59.690 --> 06:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
2021 that's eighty thousand dollars and
 
06:09:01.128 --> 06:09:01.138 align:start position:0%
so someone could make seventy five
 
06:09:02.510 --> 06:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars I don't think they're
 
06:09:04.368 --> 06:09:04.378 align:start position:0%
in need of a subsidy if they're living
 
06:09:06.170 --> 06:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
in public housing they're already
 
06:09:08.270 --> 06:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
getting a subsidy and there's a lot of
 
06:09:09.590 --> 06:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire that make less
 
06:09:11.270 --> 06:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
than 80 000 that are living in an
 
06:09:13.128 --> 06:09:13.138 align:start position:0%
apartment or living in a trailer or
 
06:09:15.230 --> 06:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
living in a small house and they'll be
 
06:09:16.670 --> 06:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
paying higher electric rates to
 
06:09:18.410 --> 06:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
subsidize these people who again already
 
06:09:19.910 --> 06:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
getting subsidized housing now they're
 
06:09:21.530 --> 06:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
going to get subsidized electricity I
 
06:09:24.170 --> 06:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
just think it's way too much money
 
06:09:26.628 --> 06:09:26.638 align:start position:0%
and again it's the same old thing hide
 
06:09:28.190 --> 06:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
the hide the thing in the electric bill
 
06:09:30.170 --> 06:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
if you want to subsidize people to put
 
06:09:32.390 --> 06:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
solar in put attacks out there let
 
06:09:34.548 --> 06:09:34.558 align:start position:0%
people know what they're paying
 
06:09:37.788 --> 06:09:37.798 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chairman on that point yes if
 
06:09:41.090 --> 06:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
they say area median income then is
 
06:09:44.270 --> 06:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester gonna have the same as you
 
06:09:47.270 --> 06:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
know Lebanon or Hanover I I think area
 
06:09:51.368 --> 06:09:51.378 align:start position:0%
media income becomes more specific right
 
06:09:53.810 --> 06:09:53.820 align:start position:0%
I believe it is broken out by different
 
06:09:56.270 --> 06:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
areas and it says calculated by the
 
06:09:57.530 --> 06:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
Department of Housing and Urban
 
06:09:59.390 --> 06:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
Development so I think
 
06:10:01.128 --> 06:10:01.138 align:start position:0%
um I think it might be a little more
 
06:10:05.030 --> 06:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
discreet than the way your your concerns
 
06:10:06.670 --> 06:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
um representative Harrington
 
06:10:09.170 --> 06:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
representative muns I think I can
 
06:10:11.448 --> 06:10:11.458 align:start position:0%
actually answer that because I actually
 
06:10:15.948 --> 06:10:15.958 align:start position:0%
uh downloaded the uh area Inc incomes
 
06:10:18.410 --> 06:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
and it's it's a whole group of different
 
06:10:21.530 --> 06:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
uh areas there's there's probably
 
06:10:24.190 --> 06:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say 20 different
 
06:10:26.510 --> 06:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
areas in New Hampshire and it's mostly
 
06:10:28.128 --> 06:10:28.138 align:start position:0%
by county
 
06:10:30.410 --> 06:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
mostly by County yeah and they and they
 
06:10:33.230 --> 06:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
carve out Nashua and Manchester as
 
06:10:35.510 --> 06:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
separate uh entities
 
06:10:38.628 --> 06:10:38.638 align:start position:0%
okay traditional comment representative
 
06:10:41.208 --> 06:10:41.218 align:start position:0%
munz so I'm I just can you explain what
 
06:10:44.750 --> 06:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
your amendment is and what it does
 
06:10:48.910 --> 06:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
yes so in the in the lines of
 
06:10:52.310 --> 06:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
six and lines 15 it allows the
 
06:10:56.810 --> 06:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
department of energy to develop rules
 
06:11:01.070 --> 06:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
or issue orders to develop the process
 
06:11:04.190 --> 06:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
and the means by which these low
 
06:11:07.250 --> 06:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
moderate income Community solar projects
 
06:11:11.750 --> 06:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
are created and operated
 
06:11:13.730 --> 06:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
and then there is additional language
 
06:11:16.070 --> 06:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
down in
 
06:11:18.590 --> 06:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
um starting on lines 25 and running
 
06:11:20.690 --> 06:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
through lines 30.
 
06:11:24.170 --> 06:11:24.180 align:start position:0%
that specify
 
06:11:27.110 --> 06:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
that well this was a that was already in
 
06:11:28.368 --> 06:11:28.378 align:start position:0%
there this was already in the bill
 
06:11:30.010 --> 06:11:30.020 align:start position:0%
except for the word
 
06:11:34.430 --> 06:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
uh on line 26 as described in the
 
06:11:37.368 --> 06:11:37.378 align:start position:0%
original bill that was as defined
 
06:11:40.670 --> 06:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
and excuse me
 
06:11:40.680 --> 06:11:41.990 align:start position:0%
and excuse me
the

06:11:41.990 --> 06:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:11:47.208 --> 06:11:47.218 align:start position:0%
RSA to which as defined referred doesn't
 
06:11:49.368 --> 06:11:49.378 align:start position:0%
actually Define anything all it does is
 
06:11:52.610 --> 06:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
it points to Federal legislation
 
06:11:55.730 --> 06:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
so changing the word as defined to as
 
06:11:58.310 --> 06:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
described was determined to be
 
06:12:01.368 --> 06:12:01.378 align:start position:0%
a more accurate way to
 
06:12:01.378 --> 06:12:01.970 align:start position:0%
a more accurate way to
um

06:12:01.970 --> 06:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:04.548 --> 06:12:04.558 align:start position:0%
make that reference and the same change
 
06:12:08.990 --> 06:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
was made on line 16 in on page two so
 
06:12:10.788 --> 06:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
those are the those are the changes
 
06:12:12.410 --> 06:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
they're relatively small relatively
 
06:12:14.690 --> 06:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
minor thank you
 
06:12:16.788 --> 06:12:16.798 align:start position:0%
further descriptive
 
06:12:16.798 --> 06:12:18.110 align:start position:0%
further descriptive
discussion

06:12:18.110 --> 06:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
06:12:19.970 --> 06:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
representative Summers
 
06:12:21.590 --> 06:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:12:23.330 --> 06:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
um I know I mentioned it over here when
 
06:12:24.830 --> 06:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
we were discussing the only thing I have
 
06:12:27.708 --> 06:12:27.718 align:start position:0%
an issue with is the uh in some
 
06:12:30.410 --> 06:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
municipalities eighty percent of the
 
06:12:32.810 --> 06:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
area of median income might be a little
 
06:12:38.090 --> 06:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:38.100 --> 06:12:39.650 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:12:39.650 --> 06:12:39.660 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:12:41.570 --> 06:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
06:12:44.628 --> 06:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
representative Mickey yeah my comment is
 
06:12:47.448 --> 06:12:47.458 align:start position:0%
on the changes that say by rule or order
 
06:12:49.850 --> 06:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
of the Department of energy
 
06:12:52.430 --> 06:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
um I wasn't under the impression I
 
06:12:53.750 --> 06:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
didn't know that
 
06:12:55.730 --> 06:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
the department of energy made rules or
 
06:12:58.010 --> 06:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
orders like I traditionally would see
 
06:12:59.330 --> 06:12:59.340 align:start position:0%
rules and orders coming out of the
 
06:13:00.890 --> 06:13:00.900 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission so I'm just
 
06:13:00.900 --> 06:13:01.910 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission so I'm just
curious

06:13:01.910 --> 06:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
curious
 
06:13:05.750 --> 06:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
why that language is is there and if
 
06:13:07.910 --> 06:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
that is customary I know you and I when
 
06:13:09.490 --> 06:13:09.500 align:start position:0%
we had a conversation I mentioned
 
06:13:12.770 --> 06:13:12.780 align:start position:0%
regulatory versus you know an agency and
 
06:13:14.810 --> 06:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
so if you could just clarify that
 
06:13:17.270 --> 06:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
because it looks like it's new language
 
06:13:21.530 --> 06:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
sure so all uh executive departments
 
06:13:24.230 --> 06:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
have regulatory Authority Department of
 
06:13:25.970 --> 06:13:25.980 align:start position:0%
Transportation Department of Health and
 
06:13:28.490 --> 06:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
Human Services on and on and they all
 
06:13:32.150 --> 06:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
make rules that's what RSA 541a is all
 
06:13:34.490 --> 06:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
about it's rulemaking Authority for
 
06:13:36.650 --> 06:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
executive departments
 
06:13:39.350 --> 06:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
so the if if you'll recall when we
 
06:13:44.150 --> 06:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
passed hb2 back in 2021
 
06:13:47.810 --> 06:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
the the bill that broke up the Public
 
06:13:50.628 --> 06:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission into the the new
 
06:13:53.090 --> 06:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
puc and the department of energy
 
06:13:56.510 --> 06:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
part of the legislation in hb2
 
06:13:56.520 --> 06:13:58.368 align:start position:0%
part of the legislation in hb2
directed

06:13:58.368 --> 06:13:58.378 align:start position:0%
directed
 
06:14:00.230 --> 06:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
and subsequent legislation that we
 
06:14:02.390 --> 06:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
passed in in this committee and in the
 
06:14:04.670 --> 06:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
house in the Senate directed the
 
06:14:07.070 --> 06:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
department to develop rules
 
06:14:10.430 --> 06:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
regulatory rules and so what this means
 
06:14:13.490 --> 06:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
in this legislation is that
 
06:14:17.448 --> 06:14:17.458 align:start position:0%
Community solar projects are a area
 
06:14:17.458 --> 06:14:18.730 align:start position:0%
Community solar projects are a area
where

06:14:18.730 --> 06:14:18.740 align:start position:0%
where
 
06:14:22.610 --> 06:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
Department of energy rules May apply
 
06:14:22.620 --> 06:14:24.170 align:start position:0%
Department of energy rules May apply
so

06:14:24.170 --> 06:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:14:24.180 --> 06:14:28.070 align:start position:0%
so
um

06:14:28.070 --> 06:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:32.170 --> 06:14:32.180 align:start position:0%
sorry I had to answer my phone so
 
06:14:35.510 --> 06:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
basically what this
 
06:14:38.990 --> 06:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
clarification to the legislation does is
 
06:14:42.470 --> 06:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
it shows that the department
 
06:14:46.310 --> 06:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
may use its rulemaking Authority or its
 
06:14:47.990 --> 06:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
authority to
 
06:14:49.970 --> 06:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
create orders
 
06:14:51.948 --> 06:14:51.958 align:start position:0%
to con to
 
06:14:51.958 --> 06:14:52.788 align:start position:0%
to con to
um

06:14:52.788 --> 06:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:57.110 --> 06:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
control the way that these low-income
 
06:15:01.128 --> 06:15:01.138 align:start position:0%
Community solar projects are created and
 
06:15:01.138 --> 06:15:02.570 align:start position:0%
Community solar projects are created and
operated

06:15:02.570 --> 06:15:02.580 align:start position:0%
operated
 
06:15:05.330 --> 06:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
does that make does that explain it yeah
 
06:15:07.010 --> 06:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
I think it's a good explanation I I
 
06:15:09.170 --> 06:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
think it it represents a change I think
 
06:15:11.150 --> 06:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
the other agencies that we're discussing
 
06:15:12.708 --> 06:15:12.718 align:start position:0%
like Transportation they don't have a
 
06:15:14.090 --> 06:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission you know they don't
 
06:15:14.100 --> 06:15:15.770 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission you know they don't
have

06:15:15.770 --> 06:15:15.780 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:15:19.190 --> 06:15:19.200 align:start position:0%
um a body that generally produces the
 
06:15:22.430 --> 06:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
orders around various energy projects so
 
06:15:23.868 --> 06:15:23.878 align:start position:0%
that's why I was just it seemed like a
 
06:15:25.368 --> 06:15:25.378 align:start position:0%
change to me to say that they were going
 
06:15:27.470 --> 06:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
to start producing the orders that would
 
06:15:27.480 --> 06:15:28.548 align:start position:0%
to start producing the orders that would
allow

06:15:28.548 --> 06:15:28.558 align:start position:0%
allow
 
06:15:32.690 --> 06:15:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:34.670 --> 06:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
without putting you on the spot Mr
 
06:15:38.690 --> 06:15:38.700 align:start position:0%
Roberts could I ask you to come up and
 
06:15:43.128 --> 06:15:43.138 align:start position:0%
say a few words about the departments
 
06:15:47.810 --> 06:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:49.810 --> 06:15:49.820 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee again
 
06:15:52.430 --> 06:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
Griffin Roberts Department of energy so
 
06:15:54.530 --> 06:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
the it is correct the department did
 
06:15:58.090 --> 06:15:58.100 align:start position:0%
request the language in Amendment 1346 H
 
06:16:01.128 --> 06:16:01.138 align:start position:0%
regarding the changes on line six and
 
06:16:04.610 --> 06:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
line 15 which is the Bold uh Language by
 
06:16:07.788 --> 06:16:07.798 align:start position:0%
rule or order this stems or I should say
 
06:16:10.490 --> 06:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
this amendment amends a state statute
 
06:16:13.670 --> 06:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
that's created in Senate Bill 270 from
 
06:16:16.430 --> 06:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
last year as you might recall that bill
 
06:16:18.770 --> 06:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
required the department to establish a
 
06:16:21.048 --> 06:16:21.058 align:start position:0%
program to identify low to moderate
 
06:16:22.910 --> 06:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
income customers who could participate
 
06:16:26.990 --> 06:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
in these LMI Community solar projects
 
06:16:27.000 --> 06:16:27.770 align:start position:0%
in these LMI Community solar projects
um

06:16:27.770 --> 06:16:27.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:29.628 --> 06:16:29.638 align:start position:0%
as you'll see in the bill um the
 
06:16:29.638 --> 06:16:30.530 align:start position:0%
as you'll see in the bill um the
department

06:16:30.530 --> 06:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
department
 
06:16:33.890 --> 06:16:33.900 align:start position:0%
um have is required to uh
 
06:16:36.470 --> 06:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh create administrative rules
 
06:16:39.048 --> 06:16:39.058 align:start position:0%
um for the program the department uh
 
06:16:40.310 --> 06:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
brought forward this amendment because
 
06:16:43.010 --> 06:16:43.020 align:start position:0%
it would take substantial time for the
 
06:16:45.048 --> 06:16:45.058 align:start position:0%
Department to create those rules at the
 
06:16:48.350 --> 06:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
same time that we are uh revising our
 
06:16:49.970 --> 06:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
rules given the breakup between the puc
 
06:16:51.590 --> 06:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
and the doe
 
06:16:53.628 --> 06:16:53.638 align:start position:0%
um and given that is our understanding
 
06:16:55.010 --> 06:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
that the legislative intent was that
 
06:16:57.830 --> 06:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
this program would be up much sooner
 
06:17:00.530 --> 06:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
um we submitted this a language that
 
06:17:02.448 --> 06:17:02.458 align:start position:0%
will allow the department to issue
 
06:17:04.788 --> 06:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
orders to develop uh requirements around
 
06:17:07.730 --> 06:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
this LMI program we certainly could
 
06:17:10.070 --> 06:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
proceed without administrative rule
 
06:17:12.110 --> 06:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
however that would leave the department
 
06:17:15.230 --> 06:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
vulnerable uh to potentially Bad actors
 
06:17:17.448 --> 06:17:17.458 align:start position:0%
who could file poor or mediocre
 
06:17:19.970 --> 06:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
applications that the doe would be
 
06:17:21.948 --> 06:17:21.958 align:start position:0%
unable to deny because the only backup
 
06:17:23.930 --> 06:17:23.940 align:start position:0%
we have is what's currently existing in
 
06:17:25.190 --> 06:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
statute we do not have the
 
06:17:27.170 --> 06:17:27.180 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that would back
 
06:17:30.410 --> 06:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
that up so to ensure that we have the
 
06:17:31.970 --> 06:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
the those um
 
06:17:33.650 --> 06:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
guardrails and it has been tossed around
 
06:17:35.330 --> 06:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
quite a bit today those guard rails in
 
06:17:36.830 --> 06:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
place and to make sure that the
 
06:17:38.628 --> 06:17:38.638 align:start position:0%
legislative intent is met that we move
 
06:17:40.788 --> 06:17:40.798 align:start position:0%
this program along having the
 
06:17:44.030 --> 06:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility and statute to issue orders
 
06:17:45.650 --> 06:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
um would help us kind of bridge that Gap
 
06:17:47.448 --> 06:17:47.458 align:start position:0%
until administrative rules are formally
 
06:17:51.650 --> 06:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:53.510 --> 06:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification I think
 
06:17:55.910 --> 06:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
that helps us understand exactly what
 
06:17:58.490 --> 06:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
what the intent of this uh Amendment
 
06:18:00.830 --> 06:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
would be representative McGee
 
06:18:00.840 --> 06:18:02.448 align:start position:0%
would be representative McGee
sorry

06:18:02.448 --> 06:18:02.458 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
06:18:02.458 --> 06:18:03.830 align:start position:0%
sorry
so

06:18:03.830 --> 06:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:18:05.510 --> 06:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
am I understanding you correct that
 
06:18:07.310 --> 06:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
you're saying that the rules may not be
 
06:18:08.628 --> 06:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
ready for a while but you want to be
 
06:18:10.788 --> 06:18:10.798 align:start position:0%
able to put orders out before the rules
 
06:18:13.610 --> 06:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
are complete yes uh that's that's
 
06:18:16.010 --> 06:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
correct so we'd like to issue guard
 
06:18:18.530 --> 06:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
rails around the program by order until
 
06:18:20.448 --> 06:18:20.458 align:start position:0%
administrative rules are formally
 
06:18:23.868 --> 06:18:23.878 align:start position:0%
adopted through the formal rulemaking
 
06:18:23.878 --> 06:18:25.490 align:start position:0%
adopted through the formal rulemaking
process

06:18:25.490 --> 06:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:18:27.530 --> 06:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense yeah well I I guess
 
06:18:30.288 --> 06:18:30.298 align:start position:0%
my question would be how do you define
 
06:18:32.868 --> 06:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
what guard rails are appropriate if you
 
06:18:34.970 --> 06:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
don't have established rules that you've
 
06:18:37.128 --> 06:18:37.138 align:start position:0%
discussed sure trying to figure out what
 
06:18:39.110 --> 06:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
should be going around and I appreciate
 
06:18:40.788 --> 06:18:40.798 align:start position:0%
that I believe there is a stakeholder
 
06:18:43.128 --> 06:18:43.138 align:start position:0%
process by which a lot of this takes
 
06:18:44.930 --> 06:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
place and they're already there already
 
06:18:46.610 --> 06:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
has been regarding this LMI Community
 
06:18:48.310 --> 06:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
solar program that was developed through
 
06:18:50.930 --> 06:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 270.
 
06:18:52.430 --> 06:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding the department
 
06:18:53.810 --> 06:18:53.820 align:start position:0%
issued a letter to interested
 
06:18:56.150 --> 06:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
stakeholders here relatively a short
 
06:18:58.070 --> 06:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
time ago indicating that they're we're
 
06:19:00.948 --> 06:19:00.958 align:start position:0%
aiming to release an RFP sometime soon
 
06:19:02.448 --> 06:19:02.458 align:start position:0%
regarding that program so again
 
06:19:04.490 --> 06:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
stakeholders are involved throughout the
 
06:19:08.030 --> 06:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
process I think the goal is to you know
 
06:19:11.868 --> 06:19:11.878 align:start position:0%
not overstep and certainly not supersede
 
06:19:13.970 --> 06:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
The rulemaking Authority by just issuing
 
06:19:16.070 --> 06:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
an order and we're all done I think the
 
06:19:17.930 --> 06:19:17.940 align:start position:0%
order would really be viewed as maybe a
 
06:19:20.448 --> 06:19:20.458 align:start position:0%
stop Gap until those rules are formally
 
06:19:23.030 --> 06:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
done and adjudicated and formally put in
 
06:19:25.670 --> 06:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
place if that makes sense and to your
 
06:19:27.530 --> 06:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
other point the department does
 
06:19:29.030 --> 06:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
um have the authority under statute to
 
06:19:31.190 --> 06:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
issue orders for example just a recent
 
06:19:31.200 --> 06:19:32.448 align:start position:0%
issue orders for example just a recent
one

06:19:32.448 --> 06:19:32.458 align:start position:0%
one
 
06:19:34.610 --> 06:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
um what was it under State Statute the
 
06:19:36.190 --> 06:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
department has the authority to
 
06:19:38.448 --> 06:19:38.458 align:start position:0%
administratively lower
 
06:19:40.430 --> 06:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
um class three obligations under the RPS
 
06:19:42.230 --> 06:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
for example we just kind of issued an
 
06:19:44.030 --> 06:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
order recently after a stakeholder
 
06:19:46.730 --> 06:19:46.740 align:start position:0%
process to lower that obligation
 
06:19:49.490 --> 06:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:51.590 --> 06:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate you taking a
 
06:19:54.110 --> 06:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
question on short notice
 
06:19:58.730 --> 06:19:58.740 align:start position:0%
further comments on Senate Bill 161
 
06:20:01.090 --> 06:20:01.100 align:start position:0%
seeing none let's move on Senate Bill
 
06:20:05.208 --> 06:20:05.218 align:start position:0%
166 relative to grid modernization and I
 
06:20:07.368 --> 06:20:07.378 align:start position:0%
believe representative McGee has an
 
06:20:10.548 --> 06:20:10.558 align:start position:0%
amendment to 150 166.
 
06:20:14.690 --> 06:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
and it actually uses language that
 
06:20:14.700 --> 06:20:15.230 align:start position:0%
and it actually uses language that
um

06:20:15.230 --> 06:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:18.410 --> 06:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
I suggested as well as some language
 
06:20:22.128 --> 06:20:22.138 align:start position:0%
that she suggested so
 
06:20:24.410 --> 06:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
uh representative Mickey why don't you
 
06:20:27.170 --> 06:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
tell us about it thank you
 
06:20:33.590 --> 06:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
um yes so it's Amendment uh 2023 1392h
 
06:20:36.830 --> 06:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
and it's hot off the presses
 
06:20:40.310 --> 06:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
um the chairman and I talked last well
 
06:20:42.770 --> 06:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
over the weekend uh went over a bunch of
 
06:20:46.128 --> 06:20:46.138 align:start position:0%
bills and he had told me that there were
 
06:20:48.170 --> 06:20:48.180 align:start position:0%
a couple of changes which you see
 
06:20:51.830 --> 06:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
between lines 5 and 12.
 
06:20:54.410 --> 06:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
um that he had intended to
 
06:20:57.310 --> 06:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
bring in in an amendment on this bill
 
06:21:00.948 --> 06:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
there was also pending language on
 
06:21:04.190 --> 06:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
helping to clarify and really instruct
 
06:21:07.310 --> 06:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
what um what the legislature would like
 
06:21:10.128 --> 06:21:10.138 align:start position:0%
to see done in terms of
 
06:21:14.150 --> 06:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:16.430 --> 06:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
when reviewing these types of projects
 
06:21:18.230 --> 06:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
because there seems to be some lack of
 
06:21:21.110 --> 06:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
clarity around how that's to be done and
 
06:21:24.410 --> 06:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
so the language that's online 27 through
 
06:21:28.570 --> 06:21:28.580 align:start position:0%
32 at the bottom of the page
 
06:21:31.490 --> 06:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
it's taken from some language that was I
 
06:21:33.708 --> 06:21:33.718 align:start position:0%
guess started in I think it was 321
 
06:21:37.610 --> 06:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
which must be 321 which passed last year
 
06:21:39.530 --> 06:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
um it started there but then it got a
 
06:21:42.110 --> 06:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
little uh convoluted in the version that
 
06:21:43.910 --> 06:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
I was reading so I tried to rewrite it
 
06:21:46.548 --> 06:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
to make it clearer and so basically it
 
06:21:48.948 --> 06:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
says such credit shall be based upon the
 
06:21:51.230 --> 06:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
extent to which such exports to the
 
06:21:53.868 --> 06:21:53.878 align:start position:0%
distribution grid reduce retail loads
 
06:21:55.090 --> 06:21:55.100 align:start position:0%
calculated at the point of
 
06:21:57.650 --> 06:21:57.660 align:start position:0%
interconnection between the distribution
 
06:22:00.110 --> 06:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
system under State jurisdiction and
 
06:22:01.730 --> 06:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
Transmissions facilities under Federal
 
06:22:04.190 --> 06:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and the extent to which the
 
06:22:06.230 --> 06:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
actual transmission costs allocated to
 
06:22:07.490 --> 06:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
the distribution utility Network
 
06:22:09.708 --> 06:22:09.718 align:start position:0%
customer are reduced from what they
 
06:22:12.410 --> 06:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
would be absent the electricity exported
 
06:22:14.090 --> 06:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
to the distribution grid by the Limited
 
06:22:16.788 --> 06:22:16.798 align:start position:0%
producer so it's basically clarifying
 
06:22:19.010 --> 06:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
what should be taken into account
 
06:22:21.430 --> 06:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
and how it should be looked at
 
06:22:24.948 --> 06:22:24.958 align:start position:0%
so that language helps to make this
 
06:22:28.850 --> 06:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
portion under Pilots clearer in terms of
 
06:22:30.890 --> 06:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
um how they'll be set up because it's
 
06:22:33.110 --> 06:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
it's kind of new territory so that's the
 
06:22:34.910 --> 06:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
reason for that language
 
06:22:37.610 --> 06:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
and so those are all the changes that we
 
06:22:39.830 --> 06:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
were aware of now in one in one
 
06:22:39.840 --> 06:22:43.070 align:start position:0%
were aware of now in one in one
Amendment

06:22:43.070 --> 06:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:46.490 --> 06:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
and I've discussed these changes with
 
06:22:46.500 --> 06:22:47.390 align:start position:0%
and I've discussed these changes with
the

06:22:47.390 --> 06:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:22:49.788 --> 06:22:49.798 align:start position:0%
a few a few different people and I
 
06:22:51.770 --> 06:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
concur that these changes are worth
 
06:22:55.070 --> 06:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
making and will make Senate Bill 166 a
 
06:22:56.868 --> 06:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
stronger bill
 
06:23:03.048 --> 06:23:03.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:05.868 --> 06:23:05.878 align:start position:0%
see now let's move on to Senate Bill 167
 
06:23:08.270 --> 06:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
and I believe we have a proposed
 
06:23:10.788 --> 06:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
amendment for that one too
 
06:23:15.288 --> 06:23:15.298 align:start position:0%
that's amendment number 1391 H submitted
 
06:23:15.298 --> 06:23:16.368 align:start position:0%
that's amendment number 1391 H submitted
by

06:23:16.368 --> 06:23:16.378 align:start position:0%
by
 
06:23:19.850 --> 06:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
Representatives Kaplan and McGee and
 
06:23:21.650 --> 06:23:21.660 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan you want to tell
 
06:23:24.470 --> 06:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
us about this amendment
 
06:23:27.470 --> 06:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair um
 
06:23:29.570 --> 06:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
as I think I mentioned before and during
 
06:23:33.230 --> 06:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
the public hearing this amendment uh
 
06:23:35.810 --> 06:23:35.820 align:start position:0%
basically goes through and makes all the
 
06:23:37.910 --> 06:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
language consistent so that we know
 
06:23:39.470 --> 06:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking about Green hydrogen and a
 
06:23:42.010 --> 06:23:42.020 align:start position:0%
build to incentivize green hydrogen
 
06:23:44.150 --> 06:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
it also
 
06:23:46.548 --> 06:23:46.558 align:start position:0%
um adds language that was suggested by
 
06:23:48.110 --> 06:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue Administration
 
06:23:51.110 --> 06:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
to make the taxing the credit much
 
06:23:53.868 --> 06:23:53.878 align:start position:0%
clearer at the end paragraph one section
 
06:23:56.990 --> 06:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
seven is replaced with uh that final
 
06:24:00.910 --> 06:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:02.930 --> 06:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
that's all this stuff this is a very
 
06:24:04.548 --> 06:24:04.558 align:start position:0%
very simple Amendment
 
06:24:07.548 --> 06:24:07.558 align:start position:0%
uh basically it makes sure that the
 
06:24:08.810 --> 06:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
definition of green hydrogen is
 
06:24:12.250 --> 06:24:12.260 align:start position:0%
consistent throughout by
 
06:24:14.930 --> 06:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
removing any lines that might be
 
06:24:14.940 --> 06:24:20.448 align:start position:0%
removing any lines that might be
ambiguous

06:24:20.448 --> 06:24:20.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:22.670 --> 06:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
any questions about the amendment or
 
06:24:24.890 --> 06:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
reactions to it representative Wendy
 
06:24:27.530 --> 06:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair
 
06:24:30.350 --> 06:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
um the the last line let me see where is
 
06:24:32.990 --> 06:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
it 11 and 12 the term does not include
 
06:24:36.350 --> 06:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
hydrogen produced using steam I thought
 
06:24:36.360 --> 06:24:37.850 align:start position:0%
hydrogen produced using steam I thought
that

06:24:37.850 --> 06:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:24:40.128 --> 06:24:40.138 align:start position:0%
when when they presented the bill they
 
06:24:41.690 --> 06:24:41.700 align:start position:0%
were talking about using the steam from
 
06:24:44.030 --> 06:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
Seabrook and that seems like a free
 
06:24:46.850 --> 06:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
source of of energy so why is that in
 
06:24:46.860 --> 06:24:48.048 align:start position:0%
source of of energy so why is that in
there

06:24:48.048 --> 06:24:48.058 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:24:50.270 --> 06:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
can you be clear about what where where
 
06:24:53.810 --> 06:24:53.820 align:start position:0%
you see that about stuff um page one uh
 
06:24:56.390 --> 06:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
lines 11 and 12. all right well it
 
06:24:59.330 --> 06:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
starts on 11 it goes to to 12 and 13.
 
06:25:01.788 --> 06:25:01.798 align:start position:0%
the term does not include hydrogen
 
06:25:03.830 --> 06:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
produced using steam
 
06:25:06.610 --> 06:25:06.620 align:start position:0%
yeah steam reforming I believe that is
 
06:25:08.868 --> 06:25:08.878 align:start position:0%
I'm not certain but I think that's a
 
06:25:12.110 --> 06:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
reference to natural gas production
 
06:25:15.530 --> 06:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
so that so it doesn't exclude the steam
 
06:25:17.390 --> 06:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
from Seabrook
 
06:25:23.990 --> 06:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:26.570 --> 06:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative lewicki has
 
06:25:28.368 --> 06:25:28.378 align:start position:0%
a question okay this is actually a
 
06:25:31.490 --> 06:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
clarification what happens excuse me the
 
06:25:34.850 --> 06:25:34.860 align:start position:0%
steam itself is um not exactly reformed
 
06:25:37.128 --> 06:25:37.138 align:start position:0%
basically what you do is you combine the
 
06:25:39.070 --> 06:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
steam with a high temperature
 
06:25:41.270 --> 06:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
hydrocarbon which can be anything from
 
06:25:43.788 --> 06:25:43.798 align:start position:0%
charcoal to natural gas to oil or
 
06:25:46.548 --> 06:25:46.558 align:start position:0%
whatever and that then is actually very
 
06:25:48.170 --> 06:25:48.180 align:start position:0%
similar to what was done with this gas
 
06:25:50.030 --> 06:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
holder down the road here that they want
 
06:25:53.590 --> 06:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
to preserve and so you end up with uh
 
06:25:57.170 --> 06:25:57.180 align:start position:0%
hydrogen and carbon monoxide and then
 
06:25:58.970 --> 06:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
can separate out the hydrogen and so
 
06:26:03.350 --> 06:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's a fairly con very old process but
 
06:26:05.628 --> 06:26:05.638 align:start position:0%
it does you involve either some kind of
 
06:26:07.788 --> 06:26:07.798 align:start position:0%
hydrocarbon fuel
 
06:26:13.610 --> 06:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:17.208 --> 06:26:17.218 align:start position:0%
so this uh to make sure I understand it
 
06:26:19.190 --> 06:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're getting at here this
 
06:26:21.830 --> 06:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
last sentence says that
 
06:26:25.128 --> 06:26:25.138 align:start position:0%
any hydrogen produced using steam
 
06:26:27.410 --> 06:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
reforming or any other conversion
 
06:26:27.420 --> 06:26:28.730 align:start position:0%
reforming or any other conversion
technology

06:26:28.730 --> 06:26:28.740 align:start position:0%
technology
 
06:26:31.730 --> 06:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
that produces hydrogen from fossil fuel
 
06:26:31.740 --> 06:26:33.288 align:start position:0%
that produces hydrogen from fossil fuel
feedstock

06:26:33.288 --> 06:26:33.298 align:start position:0%
feedstock
 
06:26:35.330 --> 06:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
does not meet the definition of green
 
06:26:35.340 --> 06:26:36.708 align:start position:0%
does not meet the definition of green
hydrogen

06:26:36.708 --> 06:26:36.718 align:start position:0%
hydrogen
 
06:26:45.170 --> 06:26:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:46.788 --> 06:26:46.798 align:start position:0%
okay so this doesn't change the original
 
06:26:49.190 --> 06:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
Bill well okay
 
06:26:54.770 --> 06:26:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:56.990 --> 06:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
yeah as I said
 
06:26:58.548 --> 06:26:58.558 align:start position:0%
there in the original Bill there were
 
06:27:01.128 --> 06:27:01.138 align:start position:0%
references to hydrogen that didn't uh
 
06:27:03.048 --> 06:27:03.058 align:start position:0%
that were ambiguous because it wasn't
 
06:27:05.030 --> 06:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
clear that we were trying to talk about
 
06:27:07.250 --> 06:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
green hydrogen so I just added green to
 
06:27:10.250 --> 06:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
to everywhere where it said hydrogen
 
06:27:11.628 --> 06:27:11.638 align:start position:0%
um and there were three or four
 
06:27:15.708 --> 06:27:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:19.970 --> 06:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
also online uh section g on line 20 on
 
06:27:23.570 --> 06:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
on the uh page two line 20 page two
 
06:27:23.580 --> 06:27:26.390 align:start position:0%
on the uh page two line 20 page two
um

06:27:26.390 --> 06:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:29.030 --> 06:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
there's been a line that was edited and
 
06:27:31.850 --> 06:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
dropped from that section
 
06:27:34.730 --> 06:27:34.740 align:start position:0%
that was about uh the line referred to
 
06:27:37.548 --> 06:27:37.558 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel feed stocks used in
 
06:27:40.190 --> 06:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
production for hydrogen so as part of
 
06:27:41.750 --> 06:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
the duties of the advisory committee to
 
06:27:47.330 --> 06:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:50.030 --> 06:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
okay additional comment on whether or
 
06:27:52.310 --> 06:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
not this legislation or this amendment
 
06:27:54.470 --> 06:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
makes the bill better makes it worst
 
06:27:58.070 --> 06:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
whatever representative Summers thank
 
06:27:59.590 --> 06:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I'm just looking
 
06:28:01.610 --> 06:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
actually looking at hydrogen and
 
06:28:03.770 --> 06:28:03.780 align:start position:0%
hydrogen is becoming very popular but
 
06:28:05.990 --> 06:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
what I was going to look is the
 
06:28:09.230 --> 06:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
Restriction here on green hydrogen where
 
06:28:10.970 --> 06:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
it says it looks like 95 percent of all
 
06:28:12.230 --> 06:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
hydrogen in the United States is
 
06:28:16.150 --> 06:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
produced by either gray or blue hydrogen
 
06:28:19.430 --> 06:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
with only five percent green is this
 
06:28:22.490 --> 06:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
would this be limiting to us in any way
 
06:28:26.628 --> 06:28:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:28.730 --> 06:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
sounds like it might
 
06:28:31.250 --> 06:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
other comments do you have a reaction to
 
06:28:33.650 --> 06:28:33.660 align:start position:0%
that representative Kaplan yeah
 
06:28:35.810 --> 06:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
absolutely I mean this would limit the
 
06:28:37.730 --> 06:28:37.740 align:start position:0%
incentives to the tax credits that we
 
06:28:38.868 --> 06:28:38.878 align:start position:0%
would be offering under this bill to
 
06:28:44.208 --> 06:28:44.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:44.218 --> 06:28:45.650 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:28:45.650 --> 06:28:45.660 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:28:48.970 --> 06:28:48.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:51.170 --> 06:28:51.180 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington had some
 
06:28:53.750 --> 06:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
comments about the the tax incentives
 
06:28:56.390 --> 06:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
that were part of this bill
 
06:28:58.128 --> 06:28:58.138 align:start position:0%
yeah basically
 
06:29:02.690 --> 06:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
um it's it's another uh subsidy and uh
 
06:29:04.610 --> 06:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
if green hydrogen is a good idea and
 
06:29:06.170 --> 06:29:06.180 align:start position:0%
it's economical and all this other stuff
 
06:29:07.910 --> 06:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
why do we have to
 
06:29:10.070 --> 06:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
um spend five million dollars a year in
 
06:29:13.430 --> 06:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
tax subsidies on it and is also I don't
 
06:29:15.530 --> 06:29:15.540 align:start position:0%
have any exact number but the number of
 
06:29:17.090 --> 06:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
the federal government is tossing around
 
06:29:20.330 --> 06:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
hydrogen is in the billions and I think
 
06:29:21.948 --> 06:29:21.958 align:start position:0%
they're going to put and I don't maybe
 
06:29:23.868 --> 06:29:23.878 align:start position:0%
you could see the I think five or six
 
06:29:27.948 --> 06:29:27.958 align:start position:0%
hydrogen hubs and if we become one uh
 
06:29:29.390 --> 06:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
basically most of it's gonna be paid for
 
06:29:31.670 --> 06:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
by the federal taxpayers if we don't
 
06:29:33.410 --> 06:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
become one there's no way we can compete
 
06:29:34.430 --> 06:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
with those that are going to be
 
06:29:36.230 --> 06:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
subsidized so highly so I'm just not
 
06:29:37.490 --> 06:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
sure this bill is going to accomplish
 
06:29:37.500 --> 06:29:38.948 align:start position:0%
sure this bill is going to accomplish
anything

06:29:38.948 --> 06:29:38.958 align:start position:0%
anything
 
06:29:41.570 --> 06:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds
 
06:29:44.270 --> 06:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
well I I would just it's timely because
 
06:29:45.470 --> 06:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
I was going to comment before
 
06:29:47.750 --> 06:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington's remark but
 
06:29:49.368 --> 06:29:49.378 align:start position:0%
you know that's the point of this bill
 
06:29:53.390 --> 06:29:53.400 align:start position:0%
is his green hydrogen is an essent
 
06:29:55.788 --> 06:29:55.798 align:start position:0%
technology that holds a lot of economic
 
06:29:55.798 --> 06:29:56.750 align:start position:0%
technology that holds a lot of economic
promise

06:29:56.750 --> 06:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
promise
 
06:30:00.350 --> 06:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
and so the point of the bill is to not
 
06:30:01.910 --> 06:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
incentivize what's already happening
 
06:30:04.490 --> 06:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
where industrial hydrogen is produced
 
06:30:06.288 --> 06:30:06.298 align:start position:0%
from you know the brown process of
 
06:30:10.128 --> 06:30:10.138 align:start position:0%
reforming methane but rather uh
 
06:30:15.410 --> 06:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
like uh catalytic you know the term from
 
06:30:19.030 --> 06:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
using using renewable energy and
 
06:30:22.788 --> 06:30:22.798 align:start position:0%
as for New Hampshire becoming
 
06:30:24.650 --> 06:30:24.660 align:start position:0%
you know if there's a hydrogen Hub
 
06:30:25.910 --> 06:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately New Hampshire is the only
 
06:30:27.830 --> 06:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
state not there was an article in the
 
06:30:29.570 --> 06:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
Seacoast paper over the weekend how New
 
06:30:30.890 --> 06:30:30.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the only state in the
 
06:30:32.448 --> 06:30:32.458 align:start position:0%
Northeast not participating in the
 
06:30:34.548 --> 06:30:34.558 align:start position:0%
effort to bring a hydrogen Hub to the
 
06:30:34.558 --> 06:30:36.110 align:start position:0%
effort to bring a hydrogen Hub to the
Northeast

06:30:36.110 --> 06:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
Northeast
 
06:30:36.120 --> 06:30:36.708 align:start position:0%
Northeast
um

06:30:36.708 --> 06:30:36.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:30:40.490 --> 06:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
I think the intent of this bill is is to
 
06:30:42.830 --> 06:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
have New Hampshire do something as a
 
06:30:45.470 --> 06:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
state to have a chance of attracting
 
06:30:50.628 --> 06:30:50.638 align:start position:0%
some uh industry in this important area
 
06:30:53.090 --> 06:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
if we completely sit it out then we can
 
06:30:54.650 --> 06:30:54.660 align:start position:0%
pretty much be assured that whatever
 
06:30:56.990 --> 06:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
investment Private Industry makes in
 
06:30:58.730 --> 06:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
green hydrogen it won't be in New
 
06:30:58.740 --> 06:31:02.390 align:start position:0%
green hydrogen it won't be in New
Hampshire

06:31:02.390 --> 06:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:04.788 --> 06:31:04.798 align:start position:0%
representative McGee
 
06:31:06.590 --> 06:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:31:08.150 --> 06:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
um to follow on that point I actually
 
06:31:10.190 --> 06:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
was a co-sponsor on this bill and I
 
06:31:12.350 --> 06:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
talked with Senator Waters a few times
 
06:31:15.650 --> 06:31:15.660 align:start position:0%
on it and he also as I recall in his
 
06:31:18.170 --> 06:31:18.180 align:start position:0%
testimony was pretty clear that his
 
06:31:20.030 --> 06:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
intention was
 
06:31:23.150 --> 06:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
um to give us enabling legislation that
 
06:31:26.090 --> 06:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
would allow us to open up to the idea of
 
06:31:27.830 --> 06:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
you know welcoming some of those federal
 
06:31:30.350 --> 06:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
dollars and having green hydrogen he was
 
06:31:32.690 --> 06:31:32.700 align:start position:0%
saying particularly you know where he is
 
06:31:34.430 --> 06:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
over on the coast that they're looking
 
06:31:37.250 --> 06:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
at it in terms of transportation and
 
06:31:39.530 --> 06:31:39.540 align:start position:0%
other uses that are already being
 
06:31:41.990 --> 06:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
explored in other states and already
 
06:31:44.628 --> 06:31:44.638 align:start position:0%
being used in other states so I I think
 
06:31:47.150 --> 06:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
it that's all the intention was and the
 
06:31:48.770 --> 06:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
reason it was written as a green
 
06:31:50.810 --> 06:31:50.820 align:start position:0%
hydrogen Bill and all representative
 
06:31:53.090 --> 06:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
Kaplan and I did was say that we should
 
06:31:54.830 --> 06:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
make that a consistent reference
 
06:31:57.650 --> 06:31:57.660 align:start position:0%
throughout the language of the bill the
 
06:32:00.470 --> 06:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
main change that happens here as a
 
06:32:02.090 --> 06:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
result of us putting together an
 
06:32:04.430 --> 06:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
amendment is to make sure that the dra
 
06:32:06.170 --> 06:32:06.180 align:start position:0%
language which they said could be
 
06:32:08.570 --> 06:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
tightened up at the end said that it
 
06:32:11.390 --> 06:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
shall take effect January 1st 2029 and
 
06:32:13.430 --> 06:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
shall apply to taxable periods beginning
 
06:32:17.150 --> 06:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
after December 31st 2028 so that was the
 
06:32:19.070 --> 06:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
correction that
 
06:32:21.350 --> 06:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
that caused us to do the amendment that
 
06:32:24.170 --> 06:32:24.180 align:start position:0%
was the substantive change and the rest
 
06:32:25.850 --> 06:32:25.860 align:start position:0%
of it is really just for consistency's
 
06:32:25.860 --> 06:32:27.128 align:start position:0%
of it is really just for consistency's
sake

06:32:27.128 --> 06:32:27.138 align:start position:0%
sake
 
06:32:30.110 --> 06:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
so we didn't know that there was a
 
06:32:32.628 --> 06:32:32.638 align:start position:0%
debate on green hydrogen itself as a
 
06:32:35.750 --> 06:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
technology but um but I just want to
 
06:32:37.250 --> 06:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
bring you back to Senator Waters
 
06:32:40.128 --> 06:32:40.138 align:start position:0%
testimony because he did say that there
 
06:32:42.590 --> 06:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
is a bunch of money that's available and
 
06:32:45.110 --> 06:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
he was hoping to
 
06:32:46.850 --> 06:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
make sure that New Hampshire was
 
06:32:48.410 --> 06:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
eligible for that money and able to
 
06:32:50.990 --> 06:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
pursue these new technologies if we
 
06:32:55.190 --> 06:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:55.200 --> 06:32:58.128 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:32:58.128 --> 06:32:58.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:01.910 --> 06:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:04.070 --> 06:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
is there any place that is actually
 
06:33:06.350 --> 06:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
using hydrogen in the United States and
 
06:33:08.628 --> 06:33:08.638 align:start position:0%
any significant quantity or are we
 
06:33:09.830 --> 06:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
basically talking about something
 
06:33:11.570 --> 06:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
hypothetical that may or may not have
 
06:33:14.390 --> 06:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
problems in the future
 
06:33:17.990 --> 06:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:18.000 --> 06:33:19.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:33:19.030 --> 06:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:33:22.548 --> 06:33:22.558 align:start position:0%
yeah there are representative months you
 
06:33:25.910 --> 06:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
might have more detail I I all I would
 
06:33:27.530 --> 06:33:27.540 align:start position:0%
all I'm doing is looking at the article
 
06:33:29.750 --> 06:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
that was uh printed in the paper this
 
06:33:33.350 --> 06:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
weekend and um it makes reference to a
 
06:33:33.360 --> 06:33:35.270 align:start position:0%
weekend and um it makes reference to a
uh

06:33:35.270 --> 06:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:33:37.730 --> 06:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
um a project that's going on in
 
06:33:37.740 --> 06:33:38.868 align:start position:0%
um a project that's going on in
groverton

06:33:38.868 --> 06:33:38.878 align:start position:0%
groverton
 
06:33:40.670 --> 06:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
it'll be the world's first power plant
 
06:33:43.070 --> 06:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
completely fueled by Clean affordable
 
06:33:45.010 --> 06:33:45.020 align:start position:0%
clean hydrogen
 
06:33:45.020 --> 06:33:46.788 align:start position:0%
clean hydrogen
yeah

06:33:46.788 --> 06:33:46.798 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:33:51.708 --> 06:33:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:54.708 --> 06:33:54.718 align:start position:0%
representative murder
 
06:33:57.410 --> 06:33:57.420 align:start position:0%
yes I um the reason they came to New
 
06:33:58.610 --> 06:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I've been with them for five
 
06:34:01.250 --> 06:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
years this has kind of been flying I did
 
06:34:03.170 --> 06:34:03.180 align:start position:0%
meet with Q hydrogen on this bill last
 
06:34:05.930 --> 06:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
week and to them it's it's indifference
 
06:34:08.208 --> 06:34:08.218 align:start position:0%
for the five million dollars a year that
 
06:34:10.128 --> 06:34:10.138 align:start position:0%
the total amount going out was nothing
 
06:34:13.250 --> 06:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
to be subsidized so uh there'll be a lot
 
06:34:15.288 --> 06:34:15.298 align:start position:0%
more being offered on Q hydrogen the
 
06:34:15.298 --> 06:34:16.128 align:start position:0%
more being offered on Q hydrogen the
next

06:34:16.128 --> 06:34:16.138 align:start position:0%
next
 
06:34:18.410 --> 06:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
two months
 
06:34:20.628 --> 06:34:20.638 align:start position:0%
um so I I was up on the site last
 
06:34:23.090 --> 06:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
weekend and uh it's coming along pretty
 
06:34:26.150 --> 06:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
quick so I all I can tell you say is
 
06:34:27.470 --> 06:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
stay tuned to it
 
06:34:29.270 --> 06:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
I'm amazed it keeps getting out in the
 
06:34:30.890 --> 06:34:30.900 align:start position:0%
Press I don't know how it happens but
 
06:34:34.010 --> 06:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
I've been with them since 2017 on this
 
06:34:38.270 --> 06:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:40.490 --> 06:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
so they subscribe to the idea that if
 
06:34:43.310 --> 06:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
you build a better mousetrap y you'll
 
06:34:46.788 --> 06:34:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:46.798 --> 06:34:48.530 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:34:48.530 --> 06:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:34:50.208 --> 06:34:50.218 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:34:52.490 --> 06:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
anybody else having a comment to make
 
06:34:54.830 --> 06:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
about 167 and whether or not the
 
06:34:56.690 --> 06:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
amendment makes it better or worse or
 
06:34:56.700 --> 06:35:01.490 align:start position:0%
amendment makes it better or worse or
whatever

06:35:01.490 --> 06:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:04.128 --> 06:35:04.138 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas yeah no
 
06:35:06.230 --> 06:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
um if you're asking if the amendment is
 
06:35:07.970 --> 06:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
better I'm going to agree that yes the
 
06:35:10.128 --> 06:35:10.138 align:start position:0%
amendment makes it better
 
06:35:13.070 --> 06:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
06:35:15.288 --> 06:35:15.298 align:start position:0%
all right no further comment on this one
 
06:35:17.868 --> 06:35:17.878 align:start position:0%
Let's us move on to the last bill of the
 
06:35:20.868 --> 06:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
day which is Senate Bill 225
 
06:35:23.948 --> 06:35:23.958 align:start position:0%
which re-establishes a committee that
 
06:35:26.990 --> 06:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
existed last year
 
06:35:28.910 --> 06:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
that was created the year before I
 
06:35:28.920 --> 06:35:29.690 align:start position:0%
that was created the year before I
believe

06:35:29.690 --> 06:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
believe
 
06:35:31.430 --> 06:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
or it might have been created last year
 
06:35:34.090 --> 06:35:34.100 align:start position:0%
but in any case it it just
 
06:35:37.368 --> 06:35:37.378 align:start position:0%
re-establishes this commission to
 
06:35:40.190 --> 06:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
figure out how to assess power plants
 
06:35:44.570 --> 06:35:44.580 align:start position:0%
for tax purposes and I think
 
06:35:47.030 --> 06:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
that committee did a good job
 
06:35:49.128 --> 06:35:49.138 align:start position:0%
last year but it didn't finish its work
 
06:35:52.250 --> 06:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
and so I think we should reauthorize it
 
06:35:54.170 --> 06:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
anybody have any
 
06:35:56.570 --> 06:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
other thoughts representative Corman yes
 
06:35:58.970 --> 06:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned to you earlier I did put
 
06:36:00.650 --> 06:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
in for an amendment and I did get it
 
06:36:02.990 --> 06:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
from OLS so I have an amendment that
 
06:36:05.570 --> 06:36:05.580 align:start position:0%
corrects an error in and at the
 
06:36:07.910 --> 06:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
beginning of the bill where it repeals
 
06:36:10.190 --> 06:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
the wrong RSA and the amendment has the
 
06:36:12.288 --> 06:36:12.298 align:start position:0%
correct RSA
 
06:36:16.010 --> 06:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
good we'll adopt that Amendment tomorrow
 
06:36:18.590 --> 06:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
06:36:21.830 --> 06:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay we're done good work session we'll
 
06:36:24.048 --> 06:36:24.058 align:start position:0%
be back here tomorrow morning at 9 00
 
06:36:24.058 --> 06:36:25.430 align:start position:0%
be back here tomorrow morning at 9 00
A.M

06:36:25.430 --> 06:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
A.M
 
06:36:28.610 --> 06:36:28.620 align:start position:0%
with bells on and we will exec these
 
06:36:28.620 --> 06:36:29.628 align:start position:0%
with bells on and we will exec these
bills

06:36:29.628 --> 06:36:29.638 align:start position:0%
bills
 
06:36:32.868 --> 06:36:32.878 align:start position:0%
and determine their fate
 
06:36:35.150 --> 06:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
for width thank you for your hard work
 
06:36:39.048 --> 06:36:39.058 align:start position:0%

06:36:41.030 --> 06:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
I wasn't interested in seeing that the
 
06:36:47.868 --> 06:36:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:50.150 --> 06:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
he wants to oh it's all going to be in
 
06:36:51.890 --> 06:36:51.900 align:start position:0%
May and then after that there's you know
 
06:36:54.230 --> 06:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
no value yeah well it's like well
 
06:36:56.330 --> 06:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
actually you know if you want to be true
 
06:36:58.730 --> 06:36:58.740 align:start position:0%
it's pretty steady all summer long May
 
06:37:01.570 --> 06:37:01.580 align:start position:0%
June July August pretty pretty close
 
06:37:04.010 --> 06:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
pretty close remember to clean up all
 
06:37:05.810 --> 06:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
the paperwork around your desks please
 
06:37:13.670 --> 06:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:15.650 --> 06:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
