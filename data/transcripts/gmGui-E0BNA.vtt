00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and good
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
morning everyone
 
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.470 align:start position:0%
morning everyone
um

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
I provided written testimony on this
 
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
bill that should be at each of your
 
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
places I'm not going to read that but I
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
do want to highlight some key points
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
about this bill it's a result of
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
discussions of from the HB 737 pfas
 
00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
commission which was a commission
 
00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
established by Statute about a little
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
over three years ago to study the health
 
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
and environmental impacts of pfas
 
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
contamination from the Merrimac
 
00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
operations of cincobain there was
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
legislation that passed two years ago to
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
expand that to include the towns of
 
00:12:45.889 --> 00:12:45.899 align:start position:0%
Londonderry which has discovered to also
 
00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
be impacted so the four communities of
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
Merrimack Litchfield Bedford and
 
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
Londonderry meet monthly we also meet
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
part of that commission includes
 
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
representatives from Des DHHS UNH USGS
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
UNH and there's a couple environmental
 
00:13:07.129 --> 00:13:07.139 align:start position:0%
scientists on there and um
 
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:09.180 align:start position:0%
every year we prepare an annual report
 
00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
for the governor the speaker the Senate
 
00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
President some others about what our
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
legislative and non-legislative
 
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations would be this year the
 
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
committee came forward with three
 
00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
legislative recommendations that
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
involved funding funding to secure that
 
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
testing is done funding to ensure that
 
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:35.480 align:start position:0%
the state is is equipped to manage
 
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
upcoming mcl's drink for drinking water
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
coming from the EPA
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
um and just also to be equipped to uh
 
00:13:47.569 --> 00:13:47.579 align:start position:0%
look do perform scientific investigation
 
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
about the extent of pfas contamination
 
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
all of these three things don't just
 
00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
impact that area but they do provide a
 
00:13:57.769 --> 00:13:57.779 align:start position:0%
benefit to to the state so um with
 
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
discussions with Mr Mike wimsat from Des
 
00:14:02.329 --> 00:14:02.339 align:start position:0%
we decided to bundle these
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations into one bill and which
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
comes before you as hb212 what it does
 
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
it does several things one is it expands
 
00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
the current pfas remediation Loan Fund
 
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
which was also established by Statute a
 
00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:20.519 align:start position:0%
few years ago I believe it's funded now
 
00:14:23.449 --> 00:14:23.459 align:start position:0%
at least 50 million dollars that fund
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
provides low-cost loans and some grants
 
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
Mr whimsat could probably correct me on
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
this and I think there's also some loan
 
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
forgiveness aspect to that bill for
 
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:35.700 align:start position:0%
people that are suffering from well
 
00:14:38.449 --> 00:14:38.459 align:start position:0%
contamination and it helps provide
 
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
monies for them to install systems which
 
00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
stands for point of entry treatment
 
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.490 align:start position:0%
stands for point of entry treatment
systems

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:45.500 align:start position:0%
systems
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
212 would expand that loan forgiveness
 
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
Bill to also include two million dollars
 
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
that Des would have to address pfas
 
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
contamination testing investigation in
 
00:14:59.689 --> 00:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
the state and thus it would also rename
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
that bill the pfas response fund
 
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
um I I want to thank Mr wimsat very much
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
for his technical assistance in drafting
 
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
this bill and I would be happy to answer
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
there any questions from members of the
 
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:24.769 align:start position:0%
there any questions from members of the
committee

00:15:24.769 --> 00:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
I thought I'd have my bill more time to
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
organize the cards
 
00:15:50.689 --> 00:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and members of the
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
Mike wimsat I serve as director of the
 
00:15:58.970 --> 00:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
waste management division for the New
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
00:16:02.569 --> 00:16:02.579 align:start position:0%
Services and with me here today is our
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
pfas coordinator Amy Russo and uh we
 
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:07.980 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to come and
 
00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:10.019 align:start position:0%
testify in support of this of this bill
 
00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:13.019 align:start position:0%
so as representative rung indicated
 
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
um this is uh a bill that came in a
 
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
large part out of discussions um that
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
occurred at the HP 737 commission which
 
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
as she stated me you know meets monthly
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
and has met monthly for a few years now
 
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
to really try to get its arms around
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
um what's happening in Southern New
 
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with regard to pfas
 
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
contamination and how the agencies of
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
both and New Hampshire DHHS are
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
addressing the concerns in those
 
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.110 align:start position:0%
addressing the concerns in those
communities

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
so for us pfas is very important in
 
00:16:42.889 --> 00:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire but it's really
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
an issue that the the
 
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
includes the whole state we have uh
 
00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
challenges in both Southern New
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Seacoast but really pfas
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
because of its really ubiquitous use in
 
00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:57.180 align:start position:0%
products exists contamination exists
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
throughout the state it's more severe in
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire as a result of
 
00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
some industrial discharges that occurred
 
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
but it is an issue that is really truly
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
a Statewide issue and the uh again we
 
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
support the expansion of these allowable
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
duties under the pfas remediation Loan
 
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
Fund the
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand that really
 
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
since 2016 when this problem really
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
reared its head in Southern New
 
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Des has been directing
 
00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:26.339 align:start position:0%
resources from multiple areas to try to
 
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
understand the extent of the
 
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
contamination and really our main focus
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
has been to either reduce or eliminate
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
exposure of our citizens to pfas
 
00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
contamination much of that has been
 
00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:39.299 align:start position:0%
associated with drinking water and so
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
our Focus has largely been on drinking
 
00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
water and drinking water treatment and
 
00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
and testing as well and uh the Pea past
 
00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
formation Loan Fund really has to date
 
00:17:51.289 --> 00:17:51.299 align:start position:0%
been targeted specifically at that and
 
00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:53.780 align:start position:0%
really nothing else
 
00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
alongside that since 2019 Des has had
 
00:18:00.049 --> 00:18:00.059 align:start position:0%
the benefit of a six million dollar
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation that was uh in the in the
 
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
in the in hb4 the the Budget Trailer
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
bill that occurred that year that was
 
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
passed that year and that gave us
 
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
specific uh funding and a directive to
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
do uh testing monitoring sampling and
 
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
research associated with not just pfas
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
and drinking water systems but across
 
00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
all media because we do see it we're
 
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
concerns about it in both groundwater
 
00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:29.660 align:start position:0%
drinking water surface water air
 
00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
soil and biota and and the food that we
 
00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
so we've done we've used those funds in
 
00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
large part to really a lot of those
 
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
funds have been have gone towards
 
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
testing and that's been the biggest
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
concern is that because of the
 
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous nature of these we need to do
 
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
testing really anywhere so at this point
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
anywhere that anyone asks us we
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
generally are able to go and Sample
 
00:18:54.529 --> 00:18:54.539 align:start position:0%
their well and understand and find out
 
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
what the pfas concentrations are on the
 
00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
well and then help them through a
 
00:18:59.690 --> 00:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
variety of other programs address that
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
if it's found that they're well as
 
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
contaminated and that's an important
 
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
part of what we do we've made great
 
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
strides we've done thousands of Wells
 
00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
that we've tested over the last several
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
years but the need for that work is
 
00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:12.299 align:start position:0%
still very great there's a lot of work
 
00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:15.299 align:start position:0%
we still have yet to do and the that
 
00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
that appropriation that happened in 2019
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
has been tremendously helpful but it
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
lapses in five months it lapses in at
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
the end of June of this year so what
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do would be to
 
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
expand the the sort of the reach of this
 
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
remediation Loan Fund to also include a
 
00:19:36.289 --> 00:19:36.299 align:start position:0%
directive and an authority for Des to do
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
this additional work that I've just
 
00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
described and really make this pfas
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
response fund as it would be renamed if
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
the bill passes a comprehensive tool and
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
resource for the agency to continue
 
00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:51.500 align:start position:0%
doing this very important work
 
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
we don't take a position specific
 
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
particularly on the source of any
 
00:19:57.409 --> 00:19:57.419 align:start position:0%
appropriation that's that's you know for
 
00:19:58.970 --> 00:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
the legislature and the governor to sort
 
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
out in this year's biennial budget
 
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
process but we're certainly very
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
supportive of um you know providing
 
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
additional funding and expanding the
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
scope of the pfas response fund to to do
 
00:20:12.409 --> 00:20:12.419 align:start position:0%
this work and with that I'll be happy to
 
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
answer it along with Ms Russo to answer
 
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
any questions from members of the
 
00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:30.310 align:start position:0%
any questions from members of the
committee

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:33.549 --> 00:20:33.559 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for coming to
 
00:20:36.049 --> 00:20:36.059 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for coming to testify
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative McHugh from Merrimack
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
um and thank you representative wrong
 
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
for bringing this bill for our community
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
um so what I'm hearing you say is you
 
00:20:48.529 --> 00:20:48.539 align:start position:0%
support the bill but not necessarily the
 
00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:50.090 align:start position:0%
support the bill but not necessarily the
funding

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
no I'll thank you for the question I
 
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:53.780 align:start position:0%
want to be very clear about that there's
 
00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
this this is something that you will
 
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
hear I think from Des as a familiar
 
00:20:59.690 --> 00:20:59.700 align:start position:0%
refrain there are a number of bills that
 
00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:01.980 align:start position:0%
come before the legislature this year
 
00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
um that do provide an appropriation for
 
00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
funding and I think consistently what
 
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
you will hear from Des staff who testify
 
00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
on those bills is that the agency is not
 
00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:12.900 align:start position:0%
taking a position on the appropriation
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
and that is not that's nothing to do
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
with the importance of this fund or the
 
00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
work that I've just described that's
 
00:21:21.409 --> 00:21:21.419 align:start position:0%
across the board we recognize that the
 
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
legislature in the governor's office you
 
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
know the lecture is going to hear from
 
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
the governor around Valentine's Day his
 
00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
budget proposal and they're going to be
 
00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
working very hard over the next several
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
months to determine a lot of multiple
 
00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
priorities and we know that there are
 
00:21:36.649 --> 00:21:36.659 align:start position:0%
you know the regular funds available and
 
00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
there's Jennifer and surplus funds
 
00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:40.580 align:start position:0%
available and there are multiple parties
 
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
vying for those funds with many
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
different purposes and reasons and from
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
our perspective as a regulatory agency
 
00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:49.799 align:start position:0%
we're not taking position on that that's
 
00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:51.780 align:start position:0%
really we see that as the purview of the
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
legislature in the governor's office and
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
we're just simply not taking a position
 
00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:57.659 align:start position:0%
on the Appropriations because you know
 
00:21:59.930 --> 00:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
that's something that the legislature
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
sorts out and and we don't we're not
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
really trying to enter The Fray on that
 
00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
I guess is what I would say I hope you
 
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
don't in any way take it as any lukewarm
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm for what this bill was trying
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up follow-up thank you Mr
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
chairman so thank you for your support
 
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
for this bill for our community and we
 
00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
understand your your position on the
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
funding we'll sort it out in the budget
 
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
process but we thank you for your for
 
00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
that I apologize there representative uh
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
yes I'm going to ask everybody please
 
00:22:39.169 --> 00:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
turn your your name tags to it to me
 
00:22:40.669 --> 00:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
that's going to make it hard for me
 
00:22:40.679 --> 00:22:41.710 align:start position:0%
that's going to make it hard for me
because

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
well that's that's okay
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's not okay when the chairman gets for
 
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.029 align:start position:0%
it's not okay when the chairman gets for
sure

00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:51.919 align:start position:0%
we have bad glasses
 
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
yes it's easier for you because after a
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
while I'll get it I'll have everybody's
 
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
name but not as the second meeting
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative Vale I know you can't put
 
00:23:06.529 --> 00:23:06.539 align:start position:0%
it toward me I read I know
 
00:23:09.649 --> 00:23:09.659 align:start position:0%
yes representative Vale for a question
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I just have a
 
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
quick question maybe you could help me
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
and walk me through I'm looking at the
 
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.970 align:start position:0%
and walk me through I'm looking at the
bill

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
um and it says and I'm asking you
 
00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
because it says the department shall so
 
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
coming down to eight we're talking about
 
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
a potentially liable third party
 
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
um and how the treatment of that person
 
00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
would be who would be a potentially
 
00:23:39.529 --> 00:23:39.539 align:start position:0%
responsible or liable third party in in
 
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
terms of like an example I'm sorry can
 
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
you tell me where in the bill you're
 
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
you're at oh I'm so sorry
 
00:23:48.529 --> 00:23:48.539 align:start position:0%
um I'm in the first mention is in Roman
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:58.610 --> 00:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
oh I see okay and then again in four
 
00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:01.220 align:start position:0%
um it's mentioned again
 
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
oh so yeah that that reference is um so
 
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:08.220 align:start position:0%
when this fund was first created as a p
 
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:10.740 align:start position:0%
faster mediation Loan Fund
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
um it was uh capitalized with uh 50
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars in in general funds or
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
excuse me in
 
00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:17.630 align:start position:0%
excuse me in
um

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
because it was I'm sorry as a capital
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
appropriation and
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
um what it meant was we were going to be
 
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
making loans and eventually grants to
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
parties that needed to treat their water
 
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
but there was a concern on the part of
 
00:24:33.169 --> 00:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
the legislature appropriately that if
 
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
there were parties who were responsible
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
for that contamination that that those
 
00:24:39.049 --> 00:24:39.059 align:start position:0%
funds should in the first instance come
 
00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
from those parties and so what that
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
provision essentially does is um if
 
00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
you're going to come to the fund and
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
look for assistance we want to make sure
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
that you if you're a water system that
 
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
you've looked at you know if you have
 
00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:55.740 align:start position:0%
identified and potentially responsible
 
00:24:57.409 --> 00:24:57.419 align:start position:0%
party someone who caused the release and
 
00:24:59.570 --> 00:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
contaminated your water supply that you
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
were also looking to them for assistance
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's what those Provisions are
 
00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.610 align:start position:0%
that's that's what those Provisions are
about

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
representative harp for question thank
 
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
question even though you're not talking
 
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
about the appropriation you did mention
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
that six million dollars were allocated
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
before your department for different
 
00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
reasons including use and then the loans
 
00:25:27.529 --> 00:25:27.539 align:start position:0%
can you tell me how much of the six
 
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars was used do you know
 
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
that yes well I'm gonna I'm gonna turn
 
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:32.700 align:start position:0%
it over to the person who's managing
 
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
that money to speak to that she's a
 
00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:36.110 align:start position:0%
that money to speak to that she's a
millionaire

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
millionaire
 
00:25:39.169 --> 00:25:39.179 align:start position:0%
yes so by the end of this fiscal year we
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
are on track to have used every cent of
 
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
the six million dollars it's all been
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
appropriated to different tasks and
 
00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.690 align:start position:0%
appropriated to different tasks and
initiatives

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
initiatives
 
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
um so at yeah it will all be used there
 
00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
questions from anyone else uh
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative Darby
 
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh related to that
 
00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
I'm a little confused
 
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
um it seems like this originally there
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
was the remediation fund which I heard a
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
number 50 million was funded and then 6
 
00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:19.740 align:start position:0%
million was added in 2019 I think for
 
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
the um you know to help
 
00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
um you know to help do the testing is
 
00:26:27.049 --> 00:26:27.059 align:start position:0%
the is the 2 million basically to
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
continue that testing and how long do
 
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
you think that would
 
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
um would last
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
sure so yeah so and to be clear
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
um the 50 million that was initially
 
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
appropriated to this fund was
 
00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:42.380 align:start position:0%
specifically and it continues to be
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
specifically targeted towards loans and
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
grants for loans for uh water systems
 
00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
that are going to be treating for pfas
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
that money was earmarked for that and
 
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
that and it's actually all spoken for
 
00:26:57.049 --> 00:26:57.059 align:start position:0%
that we're we're we're actually loan
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
earnings at all
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
that's half-spoken for so so but that
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
money is still available in the fund and
 
00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
it's specifically earmarked for that
 
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:05.990 align:start position:0%
it's specifically earmarked for that
purpose

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
um the 6 million was a separate
 
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
appropriation that did not become part
 
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
of this fund it was a separate and part
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
appropriation that the department has
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
been utilizing since 2019 to do the work
 
00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:18.179 align:start position:0%
that I described
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
so there's two things happening here
 
00:27:21.529 --> 00:27:21.539 align:start position:0%
with this bill it's basically because
 
00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
that money is lapsing what this bill
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
will do is it'll sort of renew the
 
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:28.740 align:start position:0%
directive to do that additional work and
 
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
also provide additional funding for
 
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
doing so
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
um so the short answer is yes it will be
 
00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:35.820 align:start position:0%
to continue that work but I want to
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
emphasize that that work is morphing
 
00:27:39.649 --> 00:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
over time right the the need that we had
 
00:27:42.289 --> 00:27:42.299 align:start position:0%
back then was we still had thousands of
 
00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
Wells to people who really want to have
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
their water sampled we still get those
 
00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.059 align:start position:0%
requests we still have a lot of work to
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
do in that regard but we've made certain
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of progress because I think about
 
00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:54.539 align:start position:0%
1.7 million of that of that 6 million
 
00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
has been specifically targeted towards
 
00:27:58.850 --> 00:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
analytical costs for sampling Wells so
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
we sampled a lot of Wells but what we're
 
00:28:03.169 --> 00:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
learning you know as this so as it
 
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:05.700 align:start position:0%
morphs we have additional work to do we
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
have people asking questions about
 
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
um you know bio cells land application
 
00:28:12.049 --> 00:28:12.059 align:start position:0%
what does that mean does that have an
 
00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
impact on food supply or on soil quality
 
00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
what about just areas where we know
 
00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:20.220 align:start position:0%
there's been aerial deposition of pfas
 
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
what is the soil quality like we've got
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of work to do with regard to that
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
and then biota so people say well is it
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
safe to eat fish is it safe to eat farm
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
products and things like that so there's
 
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
a variety of things we don't
 
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
every time we get new data back from a
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
particular area or particular media that
 
00:28:39.289 --> 00:28:39.299 align:start position:0%
points towards new work that we need to
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
do it's not really possible to
 
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.549 align:start position:0%
do it's not really possible to
um

00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
you know prognosticate exactly where
 
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
that money will go because we're
 
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
basically following the data we get if
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
we get into a neighborhood where we
 
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
didn't realize it and we suddenly
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
realized we have a lot of pfas
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
contamination drinking water a lot of
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
that money will go towards evaluating
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
that neighborhood or that Community if
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
we find a problem with soil or biota we
 
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
will go down that road so it's really
 
00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
about reacting to the data based on the
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
science based on what we get as we do
 
00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
this work
 
00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up for a follow-up very
 
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:15.590 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up for a follow-up very
briefly

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
um so I in um 2019 you had six million
 
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
that lasted four years which is 1.5 per
 
00:29:24.889 --> 00:29:24.899 align:start position:0%
year this you know we have a biannual
 
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
budget biennium budget and it's only 2
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
million so do you have enough
 
00:29:33.049 --> 00:29:33.059 align:start position:0%
well and it's hard to say because I mean
 
00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:34.919 align:start position:0%
I think that this would certainly put us
 
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
in a position to do this work for for a
 
00:29:40.909 --> 00:29:40.919 align:start position:0%
company for the biennium I believe
 
00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
um it's hard to say what what we don't
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
know right it's hard to say what we'll
 
00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:47.100 align:start position:0%
learn but at this point
 
00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
um we think this would be a a pretty
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
robust uh and an effective approach to
 
00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
the to the
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
to the work that we need to do and the
 
00:29:57.409 --> 00:29:57.419 align:start position:0%
challenges that we have
 
00:29:57.419 --> 00:30:00.649 align:start position:0%
challenges that we have
thanks

00:30:00.649 --> 00:30:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
Mr graze I mean representing New
 
00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association
 
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
for two minutes
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so Nate Grace for the
 
00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:27.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
00:30:29.649 --> 00:30:29.659 align:start position:0%
we support this bill
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
certainly if the committee considers
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
increasing the amount of funding that
 
00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:36.179 align:start position:0%
would be allocated as part of this we
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
would support that as well it seems like
 
00:30:39.529 --> 00:30:39.539 align:start position:0%
some committee members may have been
 
00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
suggesting that
 
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
realistically this is the next step
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
forward in dealing with the pfas issue
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
in our state this has been a
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
long-running issue
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh effectively as as Mr rims to
 
00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
described Des has been identifying
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
sources of contamination and it needs
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
flexibility to uh
 
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
look at those test those and figure out
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
what the next steps are because this is
 
00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
brand new for all of us
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
um and the modifications to the uh the
 
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
pfas fund and the scope of that fund
 
00:31:15.049 --> 00:31:15.059 align:start position:0%
will certainly enable them to do so we
 
00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
know this is an incredibly expensive
 
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.289 align:start position:0%
know this is an incredibly expensive
problem

00:31:18.289 --> 00:31:18.299 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
um it really we at the municipal level
 
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
are running hand in hand with Des on
 
00:31:26.889 --> 00:31:26.899 align:start position:0%
this because as the es has identified
 
00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
new and additional sources of
 
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
contamination and figured out how
 
00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
exactly the best approaches are to deal
 
00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:37.740 align:start position:0%
with that we at the municipal levels off
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
have also been responding
 
00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
um particularly in the water and
 
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
wastewater area to try to make sure that
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
um we're we're doing everything we can
 
00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
to work hand in hand with the state and
 
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with this incredible uh problem
 
00:31:54.769 --> 00:31:54.779 align:start position:0%
so we support this bill and I'm happy to
 
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
take any questions that the committee
 
00:31:58.970 --> 00:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:00.889 --> 00:32:00.899 align:start position:0%
any questions for members of the
 
00:32:00.899 --> 00:32:02.870 align:start position:0%
any questions for members of the
committee

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
Mr Vogel
 
00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:20.889 --> 00:32:20.899 align:start position:0%
Loom is he the Loon alone
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
preservation committee and uh and
 
00:32:30.669 --> 00:32:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
we want to have two of these files one
 
00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:36.059 align:start position:0%
for each Direction okay and then also we
 
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
need to reference a report like you have
 
00:32:42.889 --> 00:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
a problem okay is this for the record
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
um I'll just pass it around and then
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
and please uh get it just give it back
 
00:32:51.049 --> 00:32:51.059 align:start position:0%
we only have one of those
 
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
it'll go into the record
 
00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:56.630 align:start position:0%
it'll go into the record
and

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
this well pass this into that direction
 
00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
so uh good morning Mr chairman and
 
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:08.220 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
my name is Harry Vogel I'm the senior
 
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
biologist and executive director of The
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
Loon preservation committee I also sit
 
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
on on the Environmental Policy Committee
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire Audubon and I'm
 
00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:19.559 align:start position:0%
representing that organization as well
 
00:33:19.559 --> 00:33:20.509 align:start position:0%
representing that organization as well
today

00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
we support House Bill 212 to increase
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
testing and investigation of pfas in New
 
00:33:28.009 --> 00:33:28.019 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wildlife many contaminants
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
including pfas are known to increase in
 
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:32.700 align:start position:0%
animals as you go up aquatic food webs
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
and that is a process known as
 
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
biomagnification and also accumulate in
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
long-lived animals over time a process
 
00:33:42.769 --> 00:33:42.779 align:start position:0%
known as bioaccumulation so long-lived
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
animals at the top of aquatic food webs
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
and that includes fish loons Osprey
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
Eagles mink
 
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
otters and humans would be expected to
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
be among those most at risk for these
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
contaminants and therefore we strongly
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
support systematic testing for pfas and
 
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:02.220 align:start position:0%
one or more of those species
 
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
a well-studied example of the power of
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
biomagnification and bioaccumulation is
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
Mercury and Mercury can reach
 
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
concentrations over a million times
 
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
higher in fish in a Mercury contaminated
 
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
Lake than in the water of that Lake a
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Statewide fish consumption
 
00:34:21.649 --> 00:34:21.659 align:start position:0%
advisory is a result of Mercury's
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
ability to biomagnify and bioaccumulate
 
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
in wildlife and people
 
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:28.919 align:start position:0%
balloon preservation committee has been
 
00:34:31.129 --> 00:34:31.139 align:start position:0%
testing in viable loon eggs collected
 
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
from failed nests for pfas in a broad
 
00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
range of other contaminants since 2008.
 
00:34:40.369 --> 00:34:40.379 align:start position:0%
LPC has tested 87 loon eggs from 28
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
lakes in New Hampshire for pfas and
 
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
those eggs were collected between 1993
 
00:34:48.109 --> 00:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
and 2021. our sampling has been limited
 
00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
due to the expense of testing and it
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
represents only 13 percent of Leon lakes
 
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
in the state however even in that small
 
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
sample we have found concerning levels
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
of pfas and other contaminants in our
 
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
stage Lakes
 
00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
we found that over 37 percent of loon
 
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
eggs tested from Lakes across the state
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
other than Squam Lake exceeded levels of
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
pfos which is just a type of pfas known
 
00:35:13.609 --> 00:35:13.619 align:start position:0%
to cause negative health or reproductive

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
Lake which has been more intensively
 
00:35:20.329 --> 00:35:20.339 align:start position:0%
studied because it has experienced
 
00:35:23.089 --> 00:35:23.099 align:start position:0%
unprecedented declines in survival and
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
the eggs that we tested exceeded this
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
level of concern
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
Windham Arlington Mill Reservoir in
 
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
Salem and Lake Winnipesaukee had pfos
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
levels that were more than six times the
 
00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:41.940 align:start position:0%

follow-up investigations by the
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services on
 
00:35:50.569 --> 00:35:50.579 align:start position:0%
Canopy Lake and Arlington Mill Reservoir
 
00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
resulted in a fish consumption advisory
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
for Canopy Lake and we feel that that
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
advisory demonstrates the importance of
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
monitoring pfas in these high trophic
 
00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:02.460 align:start position:0%

and safety
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
we are concerned that many other New
 
00:36:08.329 --> 00:36:08.339 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lakes May Harbor levels of
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
pfas and other contaminants that may
 
00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
pose a risk to human and Wildlife health
 
00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:14.940 align:start position:0%
to our knowledge LPC is the only
 
00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:16.740 align:start position:0%
organization that is systematically
 
00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
testing for pfas in a wide range of
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
other contaminants that are known to
 
00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
biomagnify and bioaccumulate in wildlife
 
00:36:25.609 --> 00:36:25.619 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
we do this work because loons are a
 
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
threatened species in New Hampshire and
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
and the population is far below uh
 
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
historical levels of of the population
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire and that is despite
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
lpc's intensive management of the
 
00:36:41.329 --> 00:36:41.339 align:start position:0%

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:43.500 align:start position:0%

comprehensive contaminants testing of
 
00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:51.900 align:start position:0%
inviable lunex is limited and based on
 
00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
the results of our testing to date we
 
00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
believe that a rigorous and long-term
 
00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
monitoring effort needs to be conducted
 
00:36:58.849 --> 00:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
LPC submitted a report on our work to
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
measure contaminants and loon eggs to

Department of Environmental Services and
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
the fish and game department in November
 
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
of of 2021 and Mr chairman that is a
 
00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:11.339 align:start position:0%
report that I had submitted to you
 
00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
and in that report LPC called for
 
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
funding of a state agency program to
 
00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
investigate and monitor bioaccumulative
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
contaminants including pfas pcbs and
 
00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:23.460 align:start position:0%
other contaminants in fish or other
 
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
Wildlife so we fully support HP 212 and
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
its mandate for Des to Monitor and
 
00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
investigate pfas in New Hampshire and in
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
fact we believe that monitoring should
 
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
be expanded to other Legacy and emerging
 
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:37.740 align:start position:0%
contaminants as well and that is the end
 
00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
of my testimony but I would be happy to
 
00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:51.589 align:start position:0%

00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:09.260 align:start position:0%
wow WWE
 
00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:11.700 align:start position:0%
WWA yeah that's it I'll explain myself
 
00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:13.079 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman thanks
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Boyd Smith I'm with
 
00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:17.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Waterworks Association
 
00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:20.060 align:start position:0%
we're a Statewide organization that
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
advocates for and works with our public
 
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
drinking water sector
 
00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
so pfas is a a Statewide pervasive and
 
00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:32.220 align:start position:0%
persistent problem I think we all know
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
that you've heard from prior testimony
 
00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
how broad that is while our Focus has
 
00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
been on water it's it's in waste water
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's in biosolids it's in soil it's
 
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
basically everywhere
 
00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:45.300 align:start position:0%
um and the decisions that our
 
00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
Association members make were they're
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
all science-based we you know we follow
 
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
the data we use data to make decisions
 
00:38:53.569 --> 00:38:53.579 align:start position:0%
that have large impact and have large
 
00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
costs if you're talking about treating a
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
contaminant for many many years these
 
00:38:59.329 --> 00:38:59.339 align:start position:0%
are multi-million dollar projects as I'm
 
00:39:02.329 --> 00:39:02.339 align:start position:0%
as I'm sure that you all know and we're
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
also committed to Public Health and
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
while I'm new to this Association about
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
three years anniversary now I've heard
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
from universally from everybody in the
 
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
water operator water treatment sector
 
00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
that this is a product that people put
 
00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:18.180 align:start position:0%
in their mouths so I've never worked
 
00:39:20.089 --> 00:39:20.099 align:start position:0%
with such a
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
a broad number that are people that are
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
consistently so Mission focused towards
 
00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839 align:start position:0%
public service and public good and it's
 
00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
just an amazing sector
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
and I say that just so to give you a
 
00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:33.780 align:start position:0%
little bit of context of you know where
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
I'm coming from and why I'm here
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
so we do support this bill this idea of
 
00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
monitoring and testing to get our hands
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
on a scope of the problem is critical
 
00:39:47.329 --> 00:39:47.339 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we're really facing a pfos
 
00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
crisis this is not going to go away
 
00:39:52.329 --> 00:39:52.339 align:start position:0%
anytime soon but the initial steps of
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
determining the extent of the problem
 
00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
are absolutely critical to coming up
 
00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:01.640 align:start position:0%
with a feasible solution
 
00:40:05.089 --> 00:40:05.099 align:start position:0%
so I would like to just you know wrap up
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
reiterate we support the bill this
 
00:40:08.569 --> 00:40:08.579 align:start position:0%
continues work that DS has done
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
incredibly well and we'll I'm sure we'll
 
00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
do uh you know incredibly well into the
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
future you know plugging them and I've
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
worked with them since the 80s on one
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
side of the table the other I've got to
 
00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:22.740 align:start position:0%
be really proud of these folks they do
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
amazing work for our people so that's it
 
00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
from me happy to take any questions if
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
so any questions uh
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:52.030 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.050 align:start position:0%
I
[Music]

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:57.900 align:start position:0%
have no I do not I have no additional
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
pink cards
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh seeing that
 
00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
that is testimony will be closed and
 
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
unless okay I have no digital pink cards
 
00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
so close the test close the hearing and
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
the next we'll start the next hearing uh
 
00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.690 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.609 --> 01:01:51.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:55.140 align:start position:0%
started on
 
01:01:59.230 --> 01:01:59.240 align:start position:0%
House Bill 276 establishing the
 
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria mitigation loan litigation
 
01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund uh
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman for the
 
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
record my name is representative
 
01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
Rosemary rung from Hillsboro 12 which is
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
the town of Merrimack
 
01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
I also left you my written testimony at
 
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
your place after the last hearing but a
 
01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
serious and growing threat to the
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
Granite State to our health is the
 
01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
increased occurrence of cyanobacteria
 
01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
blooms in our lakes and rivers
 
01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
multiple scientific Studies have linked
 
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
bmaa which is a component in some
 
01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:48.950 align:start position:0%
bmaa which is a component in some
cyanotoxins

01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
cyanotoxins
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
to numerous neurological diseases
 
01:02:55.089 --> 01:02:55.099 align:start position:0%
including ALS and Alzheimer's
 
01:02:58.250 --> 01:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
cyanotoxins also cause acute ailments
 
01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
impacting the skin and digestive tracts
 
01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
and can be fatal to pets and children in
 
01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
the last few years alone hundreds of
 
01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:09.380 align:start position:0%
recreational days on New Hampshire Lakes
 
01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:12.780 align:start position:0%
were under Des Health advisories due to
 
01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
high cyanobacteria accounts
 
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
to address these blooms individual
 
01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
Watershed and Lake Associations and
 
01:03:22.609 --> 01:03:22.619 align:start position:0%
municipalities have taken it upon
 
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
themselves to finance and prepare their
 
01:03:27.849 --> 01:03:27.859 align:start position:0%
own watershed management plans which are
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
research-based data-driven
 
01:03:32.690 --> 01:03:32.700 align:start position:0%
professionally prepared reports which
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
analyze the Dynamics of a water body and
 
01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:39.559 align:start position:0%
identify sources of
 
01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
phosphorus and nitrogen that can trigger
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
blooms watershed management plans also
 
01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
identify how to mitigate these concerns
 
01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:49.609 align:start position:0%
identify how to mitigate these concerns
and

01:03:49.609 --> 01:03:49.619 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
which often recommend projects such as
 
01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:55.380 align:start position:0%
Wetlands restoration Road redesign
 
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
Culvert construction and septic system
 
01:04:00.289 --> 01:04:00.299 align:start position:0%
replacement among others
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the cost of these plans
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
and the projects they identify take many
 
01:04:08.329 --> 01:04:08.339 align:start position:0%
years of fundraising and requires the
 
01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
preparation and passage of Town Warren
 
01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:11.870 align:start position:0%
preparation and passage of Town Warren
articles

01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
articles
 
01:04:14.089 --> 01:04:14.099 align:start position:0%
Federal monies administered by the state
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire are extremely
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
competitive and don't adequately cover
 
01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
the costs which often causes delays of
 
01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
needed projects
 
01:04:27.109 --> 01:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
HB 276 would allow New Hampshire
 
01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:29.700 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water Systems to also apply
 
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
for loans 37 of these systems use
 
01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
surface water as their water supply
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
as experienced last year Some Water
 
01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
Systems suffered cyanobacterial blooms
 
01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
and there is a growing need for them to
 
01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
have the capability to quickly respond
 
01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
and treat toxins entering their system
 
01:04:52.609 --> 01:04:52.619 align:start position:0%
the threat to our environment health and
 
01:04:55.730 --> 01:04:55.740 align:start position:0%
economy caused by cyanobacteria blooms
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
is already recognized as a significant
 
01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
problem for our state last year this
 
01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
committee recommended for passes
 
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
passage HB 1066 to direct the New
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
01:05:14.049 --> 01:05:14.059 align:start position:0%
Services to prepare a plan to prevent
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
the increase in eventual control of
 
01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:19.859 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms and although this
 
01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
plan will not be completed until
 
01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
November it will undoubtedly require the
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
expenditure of funds to implement
 
01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
mitigation efforts HB 276 will enable a
 
01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
funding source to be available to
 
01:05:37.089 --> 01:05:37.099 align:start position:0%
provide access to funds
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
expeditiously and with the oversight and
 
01:05:43.089 --> 01:05:43.099 align:start position:0%
accountability provided by Des
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
in the last few days I've heard from
 
01:05:48.289 --> 01:05:48.299 align:start position:0%
many people I'm sure you have too and
 
01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
one person that sent me a message is an
 
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
environmental biologist called Rick
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
vanderpol and I'm sure many of you know
 
01:05:57.410 --> 01:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
him he comes to this committee often and
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
he sent me a list of of some of the
 
01:06:02.569 --> 01:06:02.579 align:start position:0%
issues some it may just be word choice
 
01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
that he wanted addressed and and I have
 
01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
a lot of respect for Mr vanderpol's
 
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
expertise as well as our own DS
 
01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner commissioner Scott who
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
raised the concern about the ability of
 
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.809 align:start position:0%
raised the concern about the ability of
watershed

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:19.819 align:start position:0%
watershed
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
associations to be able to apply for
 
01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
funding and so what I would like this
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
committee to consider as it deliberates
 
01:06:30.349 --> 01:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
and learns more about this bill is the
 
01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
possibility of having a subcommittee to
 
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
address the concerns raised by the
 
01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
commissioner and also other concerns
 
01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
that have come up
 
01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
um you know this this is a lot of money
 
01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
but it's an extreme extremely important
 
01:06:47.690 --> 01:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
topic that we have to address in the
 
01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:48.670 align:start position:0%
topic that we have to address in the
state

01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
I re refer to cyanobacteria as the
 
01:06:54.349 --> 01:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
biggest threat to New Hampshire that
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
nobody knows about and unless you've had
 
01:07:00.529 --> 01:07:00.539 align:start position:0%
first-hand experience with a bloom you
 
01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
cannot understand the
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
um the risk the fear of of coming in
 
01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
contact with it I personally know of
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
people whose dogs have died after going
 
01:07:15.289 --> 01:07:15.299 align:start position:0%
into a lake that was suffering from a
 
01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
bloom so this definitely requires our
 
01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:20.579 align:start position:0%
attention I I'm very grateful that the
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
committee passed 1066 last year but we
 
01:07:26.270 --> 01:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be able to address this
 
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
without funding it and so I want to make
 
01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
sure that a version of 276 that does
 
01:07:33.770 --> 01:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
apply for funding but does address
 
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
concerns that people have is something
 
01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
that we can get through this year and
 
01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
with that I am very happy to take any
 
01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:45.130 align:start position:0%
with that I am very happy to take any
questions

01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:45.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:47.210 --> 01:07:47.220 align:start position:0%
any members of the committee have
 
01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:51.650 align:start position:0%
any members of the committee have
questioned

01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative Darby
 
01:07:55.609 --> 01:07:55.619 align:start position:0%
representative wrong do you know if
 
01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
someone's going to be testifying about
 
01:07:58.730 --> 01:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
what the
 
01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
um what the plan or how the funding
 
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
would be uh used since there's there's a
 
01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
number of factors that go into the
 
01:08:11.329 --> 01:08:11.339 align:start position:0%
um you know the mitigation plans
 
01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:13.980 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for for your question one
 
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
of the issues that
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
um Mr vanderpol raised was how do we
 
01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:20.570 align:start position:0%
um Mr vanderpol raised was how do we
qualify

01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
qualify
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
the watershed management plans and there
 
01:08:25.729 --> 01:08:25.739 align:start position:0%
are there is EPA standards for these
 
01:08:29.209 --> 01:08:29.219 align:start position:0%
plans so I I think a subcommittee could
 
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
look at incorporating that requirement
 
01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
in the plan
 
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
um also even to have funding for
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
watershed management plans because the
 
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
the costs can be upwards of a hundred
 
01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and so a lot of these
 
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
small Lake Associations it's it's
 
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
incredible for them they I mean how many
 
01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:50.460 align:start position:0%
bake sales does it take to raise a
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
01:08:55.610 --> 01:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
um so we we may want to be incorporate
 
01:08:58.610 --> 01:08:58.620 align:start position:0%
that into the plan but if it is an EPA
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
approved plan and they're professionally
 
01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:01.970 align:start position:0%
approved plan and they're professionally
done

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:09:05.150 --> 01:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
um I was involved in the preparation of
 
01:09:06.769 --> 01:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
a watershed management plan a couple
 
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
years ago and the projects they identify
 
01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:12.900 align:start position:0%
are really driven on data that's
 
01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:14.289 align:start position:0%
are really driven on data that's
collected

01:09:14.289 --> 01:09:14.299 align:start position:0%
collected
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
very research that goes into the impact
 
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
that the data may have on a water body
 
01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
so I'm very confident that Des has the
 
01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
expertise to be able to assess any of
 
01:09:31.729 --> 01:09:31.739 align:start position:0%
these loan applications and determine if
 
01:09:35.209 --> 01:09:35.219 align:start position:0%
that project is going to is is needed if
 
01:09:35.219 --> 01:09:36.349 align:start position:0%
that project is going to is is needed if
it's

01:09:36.349 --> 01:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
um if it and if it's going to
 
01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
demonstrate some mitigation of
 
01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
phosphorus or nitrogen loading in the
 
01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:43.370 align:start position:0%
phosphorus or nitrogen loading in the
lake

01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
lake
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
I hope I answered your question okay
 
01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
I will say to the committee there is
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
someone on the list of speakers from Des
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
uh represent representative Donnelly
 
01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
our question
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question this may be a
 
01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
question that
 
01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
is related back to Des
 
01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
um I read an article that talked about
 
01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
the um acreage burning from the west and
 
01:10:22.189 --> 01:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
we all remember last year how much that
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
smoke carried over and that the ash from
 
01:10:27.169 --> 01:10:27.179 align:start position:0%
has anyone anyone done any testing from
 
01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
the ash that has been uh done the ash
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
from all the forest fires from the West
 
01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
that kids come across our great lakes
 
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
and they have contributed a lot of these
 
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
algae blooms to some of that Ash has any
 
01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
testing been done or any research done
 
01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:45.250 align:start position:0%
testing been done or any research done
from

01:10:45.250 --> 01:10:45.260 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
the forest fires that have been done
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I'm not aware
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
of any but that would be a point well
 
01:10:58.010 --> 01:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
we've seen and and I'm sure
 
01:11:00.010 --> 01:11:00.020 align:start position:0%
um the experts from DS could comment
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
more about this but
 
01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
um the biggest trigger from my
 
01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
experience with
 
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms is that the
 
01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
temperature of the water is changing our
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
profile is changing in fact I believe
 
01:11:15.890 --> 01:11:15.900 align:start position:0%
there's still open areas of Lake
 
01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee now
 
01:11:21.169 --> 01:11:21.179 align:start position:0%
um and so ice in is happening later and
 
01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
as ice out is happening earlier and the
 
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
Dynamics of that change in our climate
 
01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
and the change in in the the the the
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
temperature of the water is causing
 
01:11:36.370 --> 01:11:36.380 align:start position:0%
striations that enable
 
01:11:39.229 --> 01:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria to flourish
 
01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
um and so even the even if nitrogen and
 
01:11:45.649 --> 01:11:45.659 align:start position:0%
phosphorus loading haven't changed over
 
01:11:50.209 --> 01:11:50.219 align:start position:0%
the course of the last several decades
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
um because the temperature has we have
 
01:11:57.169 --> 01:11:57.179 align:start position:0%
to modify those other variables so if so
 
01:11:58.729 --> 01:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
in other words if if there were no
 
01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
temperature changes in our Lakes
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
that maybe the the current runoff of
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
nitrogen and phosphorus may not have
 
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
been a trigger but because of the warmer
 
01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
temperatures now it is
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
but any so what we have to do is be able
 
01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
to control what is in our power to
 
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
control and
 
01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
for instance even the the forest fires
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
down that's something we can't control
 
01:12:25.729 --> 01:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
so it might require us to be more
 
01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
diligent in what we are controlling
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's going into the lake and and
 
01:12:33.530 --> 01:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
typically the biggest General factor is
 
01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:38.750 align:start position:0%
typically the biggest General factor is
runoff

01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:52.250 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

01:12:52.250 --> 01:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:55.620 align:start position:0%

from

01:13:00.770 --> 01:13:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%

01:13:24.410 --> 01:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Ted deers I am the
 
01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
assistant director of The Water Division
 
01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
at the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services I am accompanied
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
here by Dave Niels who are see who is
 
01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
our senior biologist for the Department
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
I'm going to kick us off and then turn
 
01:13:41.209 --> 01:13:41.219 align:start position:0%
it right over to Dave uh because he's
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
the scientist
 
01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
um but if there's questions about uh
 
01:13:46.910 --> 01:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
sort of more policy or how we do things
 
01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
at DES or budgetary types of stuff then
 
01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
I will be here to be able to answer
 
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
those kinds of questions
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
so uh cyanobacteria is a huge issue I
 
01:13:58.729 --> 01:13:58.739 align:start position:0%
think representative brung did a
 
01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
fantastic job of introducing sort of the
 
01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
whole issue
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
um Dave is going to talk a little bit
 
01:14:05.930 --> 01:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
more about the issue itself sort of what
 
01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
we know about cyanobacteria and about
 
01:14:10.189 --> 01:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
the commission or the committee and the
 
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
plan the Des is currently writing
 
01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
regarding cyanobacteria and and the plan
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
that we're going to use to be able to
 
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
guide our efforts moving forward
 
01:14:22.970 --> 01:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
it is a potentially expensive issue and
 
01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
we're not taking a necessarily a
 
01:14:27.410 --> 01:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
position on this particular Bill given
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
that it is a budget year and our budget
 
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
has not yet been presented
 
01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
um so we're not going to necessarily
 
01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
take a position but just to outline some
 
01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
of the issues related to cyanobacteria
 
01:14:40.189 --> 01:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
and really be here for you all uh to be
 
01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
able to provide input to provide
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
information as you need it in order to
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
make use your important decisions so
 
01:14:49.130 --> 01:14:49.140 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to turn it right
 
01:14:51.410 --> 01:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
over to Dave and he can take it from
 
01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:55.189 align:start position:0%
over to Dave and he can take it from
there

01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:57.410 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
thanks Ted good morning committee uh
 
01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
many Chairman's although thank you again
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to testify again my
 
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
name is David Niels I'm the chief
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
aquatic biologist at DES and um I'd like
 
01:15:11.209 --> 01:15:11.219 align:start position:0%
to talk just a little bit about
 
01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria give you a little bit of
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
background on on how they're sort of
 
01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
presenting themselves in our Lake and
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
they are a natural part of the lake
 
01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:20.390 align:start position:0%
they are a natural part of the lake
ecosystem

01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
ecosystem
 
01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
many of you that may be familiar with
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
them would recognize them as a green
 
01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
scum that forms on the top of a water
 
01:15:30.050 --> 01:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
body or sometimes it presents itself as
 
01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
coloring the entire water body green
 
01:15:35.689 --> 01:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
over the past five years are lakes and
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
ponds across the state of New Hampshire
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
continue to exhibit many cyanobacterial
 
01:15:43.149 --> 01:15:43.159 align:start position:0%
blooms and in fact we've had 34
 
01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
advisories on average over the past five
 
01:15:49.970 --> 01:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
years and that usually represents about
 
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
seven to eight hundred recreational days
 
01:15:54.649 --> 01:15:54.659 align:start position:0%
combined in loss of recreational use of
 
01:15:57.169 --> 01:15:57.179 align:start position:0%
our lakes or water bodies so it it is of
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
a large impact on our water bodies so
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about recreational
 
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
impacts only
 
01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
the average length of advisory is about
 
01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:07.140 align:start position:0%
25 days so if you see an advisory posted
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
on a water body
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's not something like fecal bacteria
 
01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:12.900 align:start position:0%
that may last a couple of days it lasts
 
01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
much longer
 
01:16:17.209 --> 01:16:17.219 align:start position:0%
this past year we had 46 advisories on
 
01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
our lakes and ponds and over 50 alerts
 
01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
so an alert is a little bit less than
 
01:16:23.810 --> 01:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
advisory I know that being becomes
 
01:16:27.649 --> 01:16:27.659 align:start position:0%
confusing but cyanobacteria are very
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
um they they move very quickly so it's
 
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
oftentimes difficult to issue a formal
 
01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:37.140 align:start position:0%
advisory when they present themselves as
 
01:16:39.530 --> 01:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
a very quick Bloom and then they move
 
01:16:42.410 --> 01:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
around the lake by wind driven
 
01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
activities so we've we've instituted
 
01:16:45.890 --> 01:16:45.900 align:start position:0%
this alert
 
01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
as a way to quickly get the word out to
 
01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:52.020 align:start position:0%
recreational users around the water body
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
as representative run talked about the
 
01:16:55.729 --> 01:16:55.739 align:start position:0%
health risks of cyanobacteria come from
 
01:16:57.169 --> 01:16:57.179 align:start position:0%
the cyanotoxins that they produce
 
01:16:59.930 --> 01:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
there's many different cyanotoxins and
 
01:17:01.370 --> 01:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
they present themselves in many
 
01:17:03.770 --> 01:17:03.780 align:start position:0%
different forms the toxins are numerous
 
01:17:05.630 --> 01:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned they impact not only our
 
01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
recreational water supplies but also our
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
Drinking Water Supplies which is very
 
01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
very important
 
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
lastly they can impact agricultural uses
 
01:17:17.810 --> 01:17:17.820 align:start position:0%
in the way of watering
 
01:17:20.689 --> 01:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
watering animals and also for the crops
 
01:17:23.689 --> 01:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
that that we rely on so based on our
 
01:17:26.570 --> 01:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
experiences what we know blooms are
 
01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
generally related to excessive nutrient
 
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
loads into the water body
 
01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
I sort of sort of think about it in a
 
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
tea kettle fashion so if you think about
 
01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:39.060 align:start position:0%
what a plant needs to grow they need
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
light they need nutrients and they need
 
01:17:42.649 --> 01:17:42.659 align:start position:0%
temperature so as representative rung
 
01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
spoke about you put all those things in
 
01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
a in a tea kettle and let them sort of
 
01:17:48.290 --> 01:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
swirl around for a while you can end up
 
01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
with a cyanobacteria bloom things that
 
01:17:52.729 --> 01:17:52.739 align:start position:0%
present those nutrients are things like
 
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
storm water I'm sure most people know
 
01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
what storm water is but it's an ongoing
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
problem that's related to development
 
01:17:59.930 --> 01:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
and runoff
 
01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
lastly nutrients are can be added to
 
01:18:06.430 --> 01:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
Lake through historical
 
01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
processes that occur in the bottom of
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
the lake so as we get warmer and warmer
 
01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
temperatures the amount of oxygen on the
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
bottom of our Lake decreases and that
 
01:18:16.850 --> 01:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
can release nutrients from historical
 
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
activities so that's something that we
 
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
see pretty frequently
 
01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
several Lakes Bloom every year and we
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
know which are sort of our recurring
 
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
lakes that have cyanobacteria blooms but
 
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
what we're finding every year is that
 
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
more and more Lakes Bloom that we are
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
not aware of we're not sure if that's
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
exactly a result of additional
 
01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms and the problems
 
01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
that they present but we also have
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
people becoming more and more aware of
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
the cyanobacteria blooms that are out
 
01:18:42.169 --> 01:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
there so they're looking for those
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:47.930 --> 01:18:47.940 align:start position:0%
most importantly and the thing that this
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
bill addresses we currently have little
 
01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
opportunity to implement fixes to sign
 
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
or bacterial blooms and that's one of
 
01:18:56.350 --> 01:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
the questions that I get most frequently
 
01:18:58.910 --> 01:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
in my position is people experience a
 
01:19:00.649 --> 01:19:00.659 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria bloom they're frustrated
 
01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
by the fact that they can't use their
 
01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
water body or in the case where it
 
01:19:06.290 --> 01:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
impacts a water supply that really
 
01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
impacts Public Health but what they
 
01:19:10.189 --> 01:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
really want to know as a result of that
 
01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
bloom is how do we fix that and right
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
now we don't have the resources to fix
 
01:19:17.630 --> 01:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
that bloom so that's one way that this
 
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
to date the only example that we have in
 
01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
recent past where we've taken a a water
 
01:19:33.229 --> 01:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
body that was experienced a bloom full
 
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
circle created a watershed management
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
plan worked through the Community
 
01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
Development process and implemented what
 
01:19:42.649 --> 01:19:42.659 align:start position:0%
I call an in-lake management action was
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
on nipple Lake and that was done two
 
01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
years ago and so far that's been very
 
01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:47.149 align:start position:0%
years ago and so far that's been very
successful

01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
successful
 
01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:48.540 align:start position:0%
so it's important to keep that in mind
 
01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions about
 
01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:51.350 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions about
that

01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
also I want to bring it back to the
 
01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:54.790 align:start position:0%
also I want to bring it back to the
Statewide

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria management plan that Des
 
01:19:58.970 --> 01:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
is currently working on and the advisory
 
01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
committee that goes along with it input
 
01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:03.420 align:start position:0%
from the committee and Des professional
 
01:20:04.729 --> 01:20:04.739 align:start position:0%
staff will result in many many
 
01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
recommendations on cyanobacteria
 
01:20:09.169 --> 01:20:09.179 align:start position:0%
monitoring communication research and
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
obviously mitigation this report will be
 
01:20:14.630 --> 01:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
completed in November 2023 and we think
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
this bill will address many of the
 
01:20:17.689 --> 01:20:17.699 align:start position:0%
concerns or many of the recommendations
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
that are presented in that plan
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
as Ted mentioned while Des has not take
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
an official position on this bill in
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
particular it in its intention addresses
 
01:20:30.169 --> 01:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
many of the following needs that we feel
 
01:20:32.450 --> 01:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
will be detailed in the management plan
 
01:20:34.010 --> 01:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
we know that there will be a need to
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
mitigate of cyanobacterial blooms that's
 
01:20:38.330 --> 01:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
going to without a doubt be one of the
 
01:20:40.610 --> 01:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
primary recommendations in this plan it
 
01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
also establishes a dedicated program at
 
01:20:45.169 --> 01:20:45.179 align:start position:0%
DES but that dedicated program could be
 
01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
anywhere for mitigating cyanobacterial
 
01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:47.870 align:start position:0%
anywhere for mitigating cyanobacterial
blooms

01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
blooms
 
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
it also requires the the development of
 
01:20:52.610 --> 01:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
watershed based plans or consideration
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
of watershed based plans which often
 
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
talk about control of external nutrient
 
01:20:58.790 --> 01:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
sources which is critical for mitigating
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
cyanobacterial blooms and then lastly it
 
01:21:04.910 --> 01:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
provides an opportunity to for funding
 
01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
through the through loans
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
to mitigate cyanobacterial blooms not
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
just for recreational uses but for
 
01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
drinking water supplies which is a very
 
01:21:16.010 --> 01:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
very critical component
 
01:21:18.410 --> 01:21:18.420 align:start position:0%
Des is very committed to understanding
 
01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh cyanobacteria blooms tracking them
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
monitoring them the need for mitigation
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
is a growing concern that is existing
 
01:21:28.010 --> 01:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
around the state and severity appears to
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
be increasing of our cyanobacteria
 
01:21:31.850 --> 01:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
blooms as well
 
01:21:33.410 --> 01:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the legislature's
 
01:21:35.209 --> 01:21:35.219 align:start position:0%
continued interest in this subject and
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
consideration for potential actions to
 
01:21:38.810 --> 01:21:38.820 align:start position:0%
mitigating cyanobacteria blooms I'm
 
01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that you
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me I put a as chair I think I'm
 
01:21:52.370 --> 01:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
gonna I have to have to leave for
 
01:21:54.770 --> 01:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
another hearing very shortly I'd like to
 
01:21:58.370 --> 01:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
get my question in first then then
 
01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
uh this is basically for uh
 
01:22:09.290 --> 01:22:09.300 align:start position:0%
Mr deers uh well policy uh this is kind
 
01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:10.790 align:start position:0%
Mr deers uh well policy uh this is kind
of

01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
on the normal you know just preface uh
 
01:22:19.970 --> 01:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
is this kind of the tail end of the dog
 
01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh in when we could we're cons we have a
 
01:22:27.410 --> 01:22:27.420 align:start position:0%
1066 request a plan
 
01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
that the Des is going to be creating
 
01:22:35.689 --> 01:22:35.699 align:start position:0%
which will culminate in actions well
 
01:22:38.890 --> 01:22:38.900 align:start position:0%
this being an action is this the tale
 
01:22:43.070 --> 01:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's wagging the dog uh
 
01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:44.630 align:start position:0%
that's wagging the dog uh
of

01:22:44.630 --> 01:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
I'll ask you that question great thank
 
01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
you very much for the question I I think
 
01:22:50.209 --> 01:22:50.219 align:start position:0%
there's a number of ways to look at this
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things that Dave just um you
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
know focused on is that this isn't a new
 
01:22:58.370 --> 01:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
issue cyanobacteria is not a new issue
 
01:22:59.689 --> 01:22:59.699 align:start position:0%
we've been dealing with it we've been
 
01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:01.860 align:start position:0%
writing management plans we've been you
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
know funding management plans and
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
actions on watersheds to reduce
 
01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
nutrients for 20 years so so there are
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
elements of the plan which will come out
 
01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
this 1066 plan which are known there are
 
01:23:16.370 --> 01:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
elements which are being brainstormed
 
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
right now by the very uh creative and
 
01:23:21.770 --> 01:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
and knowledgeable people both within our
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
own staff as well as the the members of
 
01:23:28.729 --> 01:23:28.739 align:start position:0%
a really outstanding advisory committee
 
01:23:30.770 --> 01:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
um that I think is is really it's a
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
remarkable assemblage of people that are
 
01:23:35.330 --> 01:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
are really contributing to this so I
 
01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
think that what you're going to see out
 
01:23:38.930 --> 01:23:38.940 align:start position:0%
of the plan at the end of it is that
 
01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
there are some uh resource needs that
 
01:23:44.090 --> 01:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
are identified that this potentially
 
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
would help to fill
 
01:23:47.810 --> 01:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
there are also going to be a number of
 
01:23:50.630 --> 01:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
different policies maybe even some
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
statutory stuff there's going to be
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
programmatic things there's going to be
 
01:23:57.050 --> 01:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
how do you know how do citizens become
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
involved with citizen science there's
 
01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
gonna be a lot of different aspects of
 
01:24:03.649 --> 01:24:03.659 align:start position:0%
that come out of this so I don't think
 
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
that that this bill is necessarily
 
01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
um you know it's not necessarily in
 
01:24:11.149 --> 01:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
front of the wagon here
 
01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
um it really is just I think one element
 
01:24:16.810 --> 01:24:16.820 align:start position:0%
that is likely to be part of that future
 
01:24:18.890 --> 01:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
uh what we don't know exactly what's
 
01:24:19.729 --> 01:24:19.739 align:start position:0%
going to look like because we haven't
 
01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
written it yet so to that extent I think
 
01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
we do know that there will be resources
 
01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
needed to implement that plan what those
 
01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
resources look like will probably
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
include mitigation as well as any other
 
01:24:32.570 --> 01:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
a number of different other science
 
01:24:35.630 --> 01:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
practice policies procedures all those
 
01:24:39.890 --> 01:24:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
for another question yes
 
01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:44.770 align:start position:0%
for another question yes
yes

01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:44.780 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
many of these
 
01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:48.850 align:start position:0%
many of these
uh

01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:48.860 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:52.450 --> 01:24:52.460 align:start position:0%
loans funds funds have an oversight
 
01:24:56.510 --> 01:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
committee uh I don't see that in here is
 
01:24:58.189 --> 01:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
would that be necessary
 
01:25:04.669 --> 01:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
um good question I think that's
 
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
certainly up to the committee we have
 
01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
any number of different loan programs
 
01:25:09.530 --> 01:25:09.540 align:start position:0%
that don't
 
01:25:12.110 --> 01:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
have an advisory committee we have some
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
that do it
 
01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
um you know it really depends on how
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
this uh how the Beast gets created so it
 
01:25:20.689 --> 01:25:20.699 align:start position:0%
could have that
 
01:25:23.090 --> 01:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
um we certainly have a lot of experience
 
01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh with developing Grant criteria which
 
01:25:29.209 --> 01:25:29.219 align:start position:0%
are then you know judged by uh either
 
01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
staff or or some other group that looks
 
01:25:33.890 --> 01:25:33.900 align:start position:0%
at that that criteria and scores those
 
01:25:35.570 --> 01:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
proposals we have a long history of
 
01:25:37.610 --> 01:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
doing that both
 
01:25:40.189 --> 01:25:40.199 align:start position:0%
with input from the outside and and and
 
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
or or with staff experience and then uh
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
for example the the srf grants it's a
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
good example of a of a program that does
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
a whole Grant solicitation there's
 
01:25:56.030 --> 01:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
there's readily published criteria for
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
what they what where they would score
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
the the staff get together they score
 
01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
their proposals
 
01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:02.940 align:start position:0%
and then they release it to the public
 
01:26:05.629 --> 01:26:05.639 align:start position:0%
so the public has a comment has an
 
01:26:07.250 --> 01:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity to comment and say oh you
 
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
you missed you missed part of my prison
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
you messed my part of my proposal or or
 
01:26:13.850 --> 01:26:13.860 align:start position:0%
did you think about this or or maybe you
 
01:26:16.189 --> 01:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
didn't give this quite enough points
 
01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
um so there's lots of ways to set up a
 
01:26:23.930 --> 01:26:23.940 align:start position:0%
system whereby you have both input as
 
01:26:25.970 --> 01:26:25.980 align:start position:0%
well as firm criteria that help you come
 
01:26:28.370 --> 01:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
up with really good proposals
 
01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
thank you all going to church turn the
 
01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
gavel over first I'll recognize
 
01:26:38.510 --> 01:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
representative Vale and then turn the
 
01:26:41.149 --> 01:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
gavel also turn the gavel over to the
 
01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
vice chair Vice chair harp
 
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thanks we'll see you
 
01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:48.229 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thanks we'll see you
later

01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:49.790 --> 01:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
um actually I think this is more I'm not
 
01:26:56.570 --> 01:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
sure who this is for either you or
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's biology or policy but I
 
01:27:01.490 --> 01:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
just wanted to know how cyanobacteria
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
affects like a Municipal Water Supply
 
01:27:06.890 --> 01:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
I'm from Nashua full disclosure from a
 
01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:09.300 align:start position:0%
city and we have a reservoir and an
 
01:27:13.370 --> 01:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
extensive system that includes ponding
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
and Wells and so that's my question
 
01:27:21.709 --> 01:27:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
okay I'll do the best I can to answer
 
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
that so um I think cyanobacteria have
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to impact a water supply
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
pretty severely it would depend on the
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
severity of the bloom obviously
 
01:27:36.110 --> 01:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
most Water Supplies are not a water
 
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
supply expert but they have the ability
 
01:27:40.129 --> 01:27:40.139 align:start position:0%
to do some treatment of the water supply
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
and most you know they have filtration
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
they have ozonation UV and some of those
 
01:27:49.129 --> 01:27:49.139 align:start position:0%
practices can remove the cyanobacteria
 
01:27:51.649 --> 01:27:51.659 align:start position:0%
themselves the the challenge becomes
 
01:27:55.250 --> 01:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
when a bloom is very very severe
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
the cyanobacteria
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
themselves may be filtered out but the
 
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
toxins that they produce are very
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
difficult to treat
 
01:28:06.169 --> 01:28:06.179 align:start position:0%
so in a very severe Bloom you would have
 
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
a situation where the population of
 
01:28:09.290 --> 01:28:09.300 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria are continually
 
01:28:12.770 --> 01:28:12.780 align:start position:0%
reproducing and the as they die off they
 
01:28:15.709 --> 01:28:15.719 align:start position:0%
release the the cyanotoxins into the
 
01:28:17.629 --> 01:28:17.639 align:start position:0%
water body and they would be free and
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
available so I'm not quite sure how
 
01:28:21.410 --> 01:28:21.420 align:start position:0%
effective at all the treatments would be
 
01:28:23.209 --> 01:28:23.219 align:start position:0%
in removing those but it certainly can
 
01:28:24.890 --> 01:28:24.900 align:start position:0%
be problematic and you really don't need
 
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
to do a lot of Googling to uh to find
 
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
out where that was problematic you can
 
01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
out in Toledo Ohio their entire water
 
01:28:33.890 --> 01:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
system was shut down for a period of
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
weeks because of a very severe
 
01:28:39.709 --> 01:28:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the answer
 
01:28:45.290 --> 01:28:45.300 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the
 
01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:47.390 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the
representatives

01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:49.790 align:start position:0%
representatives
representative

01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh thank you Mr Vice chair
 
01:28:55.010 --> 01:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
01:28:58.250 --> 01:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned the uh the
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
sorry the plan
 
01:29:02.209 --> 01:29:02.219 align:start position:0%
um the res the resource management plan
 
01:29:03.950 --> 01:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
that was executed
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
can you
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to understand
 
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
pieces that basically where the funding
 
01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
goes in terms of the various components
 
01:29:17.090 --> 01:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
that factor into these blooms because
 
01:29:20.450 --> 01:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
you know as I've as I've read lots and
 
01:29:22.490 --> 01:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
lots and lots of emails
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
um the uh you know there's there's many
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
factors that contribute and so it it's
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
not it doesn't seem like it's just a
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
turnkey solution so I'm trying to
 
01:29:32.209 --> 01:29:32.219 align:start position:0%
understand the flow of funds to all the
 
01:29:32.219 --> 01:29:38.830 align:start position:0%
understand the flow of funds to all the
pieces

01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:41.450 --> 01:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
Ted can fill in when you talk about
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
plans I'm going to assume that you mean
 
01:29:45.890 --> 01:29:45.900 align:start position:0%
Watershed based plants okay so Watershed
 
01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
based plans can be used for a variety of
 
01:29:50.990 --> 01:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
factors and one of the the things that
 
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
we're seeing more and more is watershed
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
based plans are being used to address
 
01:29:56.330 --> 01:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
cyanobacterial blooms
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
those plans uh include a whole variety
 
01:30:02.209 --> 01:30:02.219 align:start position:0%
of different things they usually start
 
01:30:04.729 --> 01:30:04.739 align:start position:0%
with a with some background research and
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh and Community Development so you have
 
01:30:07.970 --> 01:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
to build sort of a coalition of people
 
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
behind those one of the big parts of a
 
01:30:12.649 --> 01:30:12.659 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria or I'm sorry Watershed
 
01:30:14.090 --> 01:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
based plan includes a technical
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
investigation of the lake to understand
 
01:30:17.450 --> 01:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
the nutrient sources and the nutrient
 
01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
loading factors and that's that's more
 
01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
of a scientific process so that's one
 
01:30:25.490 --> 01:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
part of many that the funding goes to
 
01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
the second part is really the
 
01:30:28.850 --> 01:30:28.860 align:start position:0%
implementation of restoration activities
 
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
and that's sort of what this bill in
 
01:30:34.250 --> 01:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
particular would address there's also
 
01:30:36.890 --> 01:30:36.900 align:start position:0%
Community sort of Outreach and education
 
01:30:38.450 --> 01:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
components of a watershed based plan
 
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
that are really critical so that's sort
 
01:30:42.530 --> 01:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
of where those funding sources go
 
01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:43.850 align:start position:0%
of where those funding sources go
yeah

01:30:43.850 --> 01:30:43.860 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:30:47.570 --> 01:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
just to add on to that is that you know
 
01:30:49.250 --> 01:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
there are a number of different factors
 
01:30:52.129 --> 01:30:52.139 align:start position:0%
which cause a cyanobacteria bloom and so
 
01:30:53.930 --> 01:30:53.940 align:start position:0%
understanding those and they're they're
 
01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
all kind of Lake specific
 
01:30:58.189 --> 01:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
um the the differences between our Lakes
 
01:31:00.350 --> 01:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
you may not see it from the from the
 
01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:01.250 align:start position:0%
you may not see it from the from the
surface

01:31:01.250 --> 01:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
surface
 
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
but our Lakes are very different whether
 
01:31:05.209 --> 01:31:05.219 align:start position:0%
they're shallow or deep Lakes do they
 
01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
stratify do they not stratify what's the
 
01:31:09.649 --> 01:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
turnover rate that they have on an
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
annual basis so one of the things that's
 
01:31:14.090 --> 01:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
done are these Lake diagnostic studies
 
01:31:17.810 --> 01:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
that look very carefully at Lakes I also
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
just want to point out because the good
 
01:31:22.729 --> 01:31:22.739 align:start position:0%
Folks at the Rivers Council would um
 
01:31:24.110 --> 01:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
would beat me about The Head and
 
01:31:26.689 --> 01:31:26.699 align:start position:0%
Shoulders if I don't is that it is also
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
possible to have cyanobacteria blooms on
 
01:31:30.530 --> 01:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
rivers and in fact that did happen last
 
01:31:33.410 --> 01:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
year so this isn't just a lake specific
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
thing you see you see it more on lakes
 
01:31:37.370 --> 01:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
because they're sort of as they've
 
01:31:39.050 --> 01:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
suggested they're more of that tea
 
01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:40.010 align:start position:0%
suggested they're more of that tea
kettle

01:31:40.010 --> 01:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
kettle
 
01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:42.780 align:start position:0%
but but there can be lots of sources
 
01:31:45.169 --> 01:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
they can be internal sources historic
 
01:31:48.290 --> 01:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
you know nippo I think the the loading
 
01:31:49.610 --> 01:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
that was in the bottom of the lake
 
01:31:51.649 --> 01:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
really relates back to deforestation
 
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
back in the 1800s that sits in the
 
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
bottom of the lake and then you know
 
01:31:59.330 --> 01:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
Rises when when uh the the dissolved
 
01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:00.900 align:start position:0%
oxygen is so low there are other places
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
where there's lots of active sources of
 
01:32:05.149 --> 01:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
nutrients all of that has to get
 
01:32:07.370 --> 01:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
addressed to that specific Lake that's
 
01:32:09.770 --> 01:32:09.780 align:start position:0%
why these kinds of watershed based plans
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
are so important is because they're
 
01:32:13.550 --> 01:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
customized to the particulars of that
 
01:32:15.890 --> 01:32:15.900 align:start position:0%
particular body of water of what would
 
01:32:18.649 --> 01:32:18.659 align:start position:0%
be causing the problem there and how you
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:24.110 --> 01:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:26.219 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up
 
01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
let me try to be a little more specific
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
with my question
 
01:32:32.090 --> 01:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
um and obviously I'm very naive on this
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
but you know factors that can contribute
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
are failing septic systems poor
 
01:32:40.030 --> 01:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
landscape practices
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
dirt roads I've read and write off from
 
01:32:45.290 --> 01:32:45.300 align:start position:0%
dirt roads so
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
um ultimately that to fix those those
 
01:32:50.689 --> 01:32:50.699 align:start position:0%
involve a lot of private parties and a
 
01:32:53.390 --> 01:32:53.400 align:start position:0%
wide variety of different sort of owners
 
01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:55.980 align:start position:0%
of those properties how does a how does
 
01:32:58.430 --> 01:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
a fund sort of engage all those private
 
01:33:00.890 --> 01:33:00.900 align:start position:0%
parties to sort of collaborate on the
 
01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
solution yeah
 
01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a that is the trick uh and
 
01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
that that's why we have professional
 
01:33:09.410 --> 01:33:09.420 align:start position:0%
staff that work with communities to try
 
01:33:11.570 --> 01:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
to build the coalitions to do exactly
 
01:33:11.580 --> 01:33:12.410 align:start position:0%
to build the coalitions to do exactly
that

01:33:12.410 --> 01:33:12.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
there are some solutions which are you
 
01:33:16.729 --> 01:33:16.739 align:start position:0%
know sort of municipal or you know
 
01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
whoever owns a Lake Association or Golf
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
Course or you know other other sorts of
 
01:33:25.550 --> 01:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
you know sort of larger entities there
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
are also you know the the death by a
 
01:33:31.129 --> 01:33:31.139 align:start position:0%
thousand paper cuts issues and and so it
 
01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
really does require a coalition this is
 
01:33:36.530 --> 01:33:36.540 align:start position:0%
not a regulatory approach
 
01:33:39.050 --> 01:33:39.060 align:start position:0%
this is an approach in which you take a
 
01:33:42.169 --> 01:33:42.179 align:start position:0%
science-based data-driven approach that
 
01:33:44.750 --> 01:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
comes up with solutions that can be
 
01:33:48.229 --> 01:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
implemented at a local scale by those
 
01:33:49.970 --> 01:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
folks who have the ability to implement
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
them so if it's a dirt road then you
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
might be working with the municipality
 
01:33:57.229 --> 01:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
to be able to address the runoff from
 
01:33:59.810 --> 01:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
that dirt road if it's a set of mean if
 
01:34:02.209 --> 01:34:02.219 align:start position:0%
it's a set of of homes or septic systems
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
we have actually dealt with groups of of
 
01:34:09.050 --> 01:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
homeowners in developments that no they
 
01:34:10.610 --> 01:34:10.620 align:start position:0%
have septic system issues and try to
 
01:34:13.629 --> 01:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
address that there are other storm water
 
01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
Landscaping you'll probably hear from
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Lakes Association they
 
01:34:19.610 --> 01:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
have programs that are oriented
 
01:34:23.149 --> 01:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
specifically on Lakefront homeowners to
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
talk to them about about their practices
 
01:34:27.649 --> 01:34:27.659 align:start position:0%
on their particular bodies of water or
 
01:34:29.629 --> 01:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
their particular land adjacent to the
 
01:34:32.689 --> 01:34:32.699 align:start position:0%
water all of that has to kind of come
 
01:34:32.699 --> 01:34:33.610 align:start position:0%
water all of that has to kind of come
together

01:34:33.610 --> 01:34:33.620 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:34:37.490 --> 01:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
over time so it isn't just just hey
 
01:34:39.649 --> 01:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
point at somebody it's their fault
 
01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
you know this is uh this is we have met
 
01:34:45.110 --> 01:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
the enemy and they is US kind of a of of
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
problem which requires that kind of
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
Coalition building which is a big part
 
01:34:52.430 --> 01:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
of how you implement Watershed based
 
01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:54.110 align:start position:0%
of how you implement Watershed based
plants

01:34:54.110 --> 01:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
plants
 
01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:00.590 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
McHugh

01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
McHugh
 
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:35:04.010 --> 01:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Deuce for coming to talk to
 
01:35:06.290 --> 01:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
us about cyanobacteria nobody likes
 
01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
green ponds come on their Lakes
 
01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
um can we talk a little bit about the
 
01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
the funding and the 25 million dollars
 
01:35:16.490 --> 01:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
for a second
 
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
um I see that the bill says and your
 
01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:19.860 align:start position:0%
testimony says that up to a million
 
01:35:21.530 --> 01:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
dollars of this money can be used
 
01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
annually to support the projects and
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
meet the criteria outlined in the bill
 
01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
what about the other 24 million how does
 
01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
that how does that work
 
01:35:32.689 --> 01:35:32.699 align:start position:0%
mechanically when does that when does
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
that money get used so I I think that
 
01:35:38.209 --> 01:35:38.219 align:start position:0%
that would still need to be figured out
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
um but my understanding is that what we
 
01:35:42.410 --> 01:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
would do is that would sit in uh trust
 
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
essentially non-lapsing account that
 
01:35:47.090 --> 01:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
would then be accessed over time and
 
01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
they would be generate overtime or
 
01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
repayment account some of it would be
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
used for loan forgiveness some of it for
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
Grants and then some of it would be loan
 
01:35:56.930 --> 01:35:56.940 align:start position:0%
would be you know repaid so this would
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
be a self-sustaining fund um after that
 
01:36:01.370 --> 01:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
initial contribution that's that's the
 
01:36:03.410 --> 01:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
way I think it as I understand the the
 
01:36:04.850 --> 01:36:04.860 align:start position:0%
bill that it's set up to do that it's
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
not not unlike
 
01:36:08.450 --> 01:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
um some of the other funds that that we
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
administer such as the groundwater trust
 
01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
such as mtbe you know there are some of
 
01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
those that we uh administer that are
 
01:36:19.129 --> 01:36:19.139 align:start position:0%
falling to that same kind of um genre
 
01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
for the question thank you Mr chairman
 
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
so thanks will I guess we'll leave the
 
01:36:28.490 --> 01:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
financial the bonding and the 30-year
 
01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:30.360 align:start position:0%
credit access and all that to the
 
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
finance committee that this will go to
 
01:36:34.129 --> 01:36:34.139 align:start position:0%
because I don't quite understand it here
 
01:36:36.169 --> 01:36:36.179 align:start position:0%
admittedly that's why I'm not in the
 
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
finance committee right um that's what
 
01:36:40.610 --> 01:36:40.620 align:start position:0%
we'll bring our our CFO also because I
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
don't understand that either so and I
 
01:36:44.090 --> 01:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
understand that um
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
DES isn't taking a position on on the
 
01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
bill anyhow but thank you for the
 
01:36:50.209 --> 01:36:50.219 align:start position:0%
education on the cyanobacteria can you
 
01:36:53.830 --> 01:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
help us at least understand how Des
 
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
prioritizes this issue amongst the
 
01:36:58.250 --> 01:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
Myriad of other issues can you at least
 
01:37:01.490 --> 01:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
prioritize it on us the this money or
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
this issue for the committee sure to be
 
01:37:06.770 --> 01:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
on a scale of one to ten is it a top you
 
01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
know number one priority or number 10
 
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
priority or something give us reasonable
 
01:37:13.250 --> 01:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
education uh this is definitely a top 10
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
issue I think
 
01:37:16.370 --> 01:37:16.380 align:start position:0%
um and and it comes back to this is an
 
01:37:18.410 --> 01:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
indicator cyanobacteria is an indicator
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
of other things going on and and so when
 
01:37:24.290 --> 01:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
you think about all of the Myriad ways
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
in which we're trying to improve water
 
01:37:30.890 --> 01:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
quality whether it be pfas or or you
 
01:37:32.810 --> 01:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
know other kinds of issues Arsenic and
 
01:37:35.689 --> 01:37:35.699 align:start position:0%
drinking water when we look at when we
 
01:37:37.610 --> 01:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
look at the issues related to storm
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
water and and especially our surface
 
01:37:42.290 --> 01:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
water quality
 
01:37:44.330 --> 01:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
90 percent
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh well let me put it let me put it what
 
01:37:48.110 --> 01:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
back up a step New Hampshire has
 
01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
excellent water quality
 
01:37:51.050 --> 01:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
our surface waters have excellent water
 
01:37:52.010 --> 01:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
quality let's put that out there
 
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
compared to a lot of other places in the
 
01:37:55.610 --> 01:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
world we have really good water quality
 
01:37:58.010 --> 01:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
except where we don't
 
01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
and the places where we don't are 90
 
01:38:03.649 --> 01:38:03.659 align:start position:0%
related to surface water runoff or other
 
01:38:07.010 --> 01:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
non-point sources of contamination so I
 
01:38:09.169 --> 01:38:09.179 align:start position:0%
just want to put that into context that
 
01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
yes we're this is a lovely State we are
 
01:38:14.570 --> 01:38:14.580 align:start position:0%
so fortunate to live in a place that is
 
01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
has a healthy environment overall
 
01:38:19.729 --> 01:38:19.739 align:start position:0%
but we do have the issues and when these
 
01:38:21.290 --> 01:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
kinds of issues show up they're largely
 
01:38:24.890 --> 01:38:24.900 align:start position:0%
related to the same kinds of things that
 
01:38:27.470 --> 01:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
cause cyanobacteria to bloom so that's
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
why in the context of sort of water writ
 
01:38:33.649 --> 01:38:33.659 align:start position:0%
large it's a relatively important issue
 
01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot we don't know about
 
01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria and so as we learn more
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
and as we become more aware of it it's
 
01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
one of those things where we start to
 
01:38:45.530 --> 01:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
recognize that it's it may be more
 
01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
dangerous or important than we thought
 
01:38:49.970 --> 01:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
finally I will say that we've also
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
received Federal funding our drinking
 
01:38:54.110 --> 01:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
water programs are now receiving we
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be around 10 million
 
01:38:57.470 --> 01:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
dollars a year to address emerging
 
01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:58.790 align:start position:0%
dollars a year to address emerging
contaminants

01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
contaminants
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
those emerging contaminants include pfas
 
01:39:03.890 --> 01:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
and some of those other things like pfas
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
but it also includes cyanobacteria the
 
01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
federal government has now recognized
 
01:39:11.209 --> 01:39:11.219 align:start position:0%
the importance of cyanobacteria related
 
01:39:13.790 --> 01:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
to drinking water so I think does that
 
01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
help to put it in context of sort of at
 
01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
least from a water perspective
 
01:39:21.169 --> 01:39:21.179 align:start position:0%
thank you is the federal funding enough
 
01:39:24.290 --> 01:39:24.300 align:start position:0%
that you don't need this so one of the
 
01:39:26.090 --> 01:39:26.100 align:start position:0%
challenges that the federal funding is
 
01:39:29.629 --> 01:39:29.639 align:start position:0%
that it is exclusively to water supply
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't address Recreation it
 
01:39:35.689 --> 01:39:35.699 align:start position:0%
doesn't address recreational impacts to
 
01:39:37.729 --> 01:39:37.739 align:start position:0%
um to lakes and ponds it only addresses
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
that so that's 34 37 whatever you said
 
01:39:43.970 --> 01:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
uh representative wrong said uh that
 
01:39:45.770 --> 01:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
only affects those particular bodies of
 
01:39:47.870 --> 01:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
water out of the Thousand
 
01:39:50.810 --> 01:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
um lakes and ponds that we have in the
 
01:39:53.209 --> 01:39:53.219 align:start position:0%
17 000 miles of rivers and streams we
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
have in the state
 
01:39:56.330 --> 01:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
thank you so it's the top 10 issue for
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
the year I think so thank you
 
01:40:01.010 --> 01:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
I have a question from Mr Nails
 
01:40:03.290 --> 01:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned the Nichols Lake can
 
01:40:05.689 --> 01:40:05.699 align:start position:0%
you do you know how large the lake is
 
01:40:08.450 --> 01:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
and how much you spent on that
 
01:40:10.490 --> 01:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
great thank you for your question
 
01:40:12.290 --> 01:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
um nipple Lake well you had to ask me
 
01:40:14.810 --> 01:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
how large it is I don't know the acreage
 
01:40:16.669 --> 01:40:16.679 align:start position:0%
of the top of my head I would say
 
01:40:18.530 --> 01:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
um it's a medium-sized medium to small
 
01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
size Lake
 
01:40:21.709 --> 01:40:21.719 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to think something that
 
01:40:21.719 --> 01:40:22.790 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to think something that
would

01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:40:24.590 --> 01:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
um you would find relevant but you know
 
01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
probably on the order of 50 acres so
 
01:40:28.610 --> 01:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
I'll put it at that and I do have some
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
numbers here just because I think nippo
 
01:40:31.970 --> 01:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
is a really good example for people to
 
01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:32.709 align:start position:0%
is a really good example for people to
understand

01:40:32.709 --> 01:40:32.719 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:40:36.169 --> 01:40:36.179 align:start position:0%
a watershed based plan development costs
 
01:40:37.790 --> 01:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
about a hundred thousand dollars
 
01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:40.620 align:start position:0%
so that's about what was spent on nipple
 
01:40:42.590 --> 01:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
league for development of the plan
 
01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
there were several things that needed to
 
01:40:46.490 --> 01:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
go into sort of implementing sort of
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
external nutrient controls on that water
 
01:40:50.570 --> 01:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
body before we could even address the
 
01:40:54.290 --> 01:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
the internal control and and they spent
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
about a hundred and fifty thousand
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
dollars controlling external nutrient
 
01:41:00.590 --> 01:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
sources this is from sources like roads
 
01:41:02.270 --> 01:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
so that was the big one we found one
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
sort of Smoking Gun it was a it was a
 
01:41:06.830 --> 01:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
dirt road that was poorly drained and it
 
01:41:08.990 --> 01:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
was a lot of sediment was running into
 
01:41:09.950 --> 01:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
the lake
 
01:41:12.050 --> 01:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
the last part of the project was really
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
the internal in Lake management which I
 
01:41:15.110 --> 01:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned which was the addition of
 
01:41:18.290 --> 01:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
aluminum to the lake in total that
 
01:41:21.590 --> 01:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
effort ended up costing about 350 000
 
01:41:23.450 --> 01:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
and that included a whole bunch of
 
01:41:24.890 --> 01:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
things before we even did the treatment
 
01:41:27.229 --> 01:41:27.239 align:start position:0%
the treatment itself was about a hundred
 
01:41:28.850 --> 01:41:28.860 align:start position:0%
and thirty thousand dollars and the
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
reason we had to spend additional monies
 
01:41:33.110 --> 01:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
is that the last time we had done an
 
01:41:34.669 --> 01:41:34.679 align:start position:0%
Alum treatment in the state of New
 
01:41:37.129 --> 01:41:37.139 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was 1984. so there's really no
 
01:41:39.410 --> 01:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
history there for us to understand the
 
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
process by which an Alum treatment could
 
01:41:46.370 --> 01:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
be planned executed and permitted so
 
01:41:49.129 --> 01:41:49.139 align:start position:0%
thank you any other Representatives have
 
01:41:49.139 --> 01:41:51.229 align:start position:0%
thank you any other Representatives have
questions

01:41:51.229 --> 01:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:41:51.239 --> 01:41:52.910 align:start position:0%
questions
if

01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
yes yeah that's a great question thank
 
01:42:11.209 --> 01:42:11.219 align:start position:0%
you very much for that question
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
as Ted mentioned every lake is different
 
01:42:15.649 --> 01:42:15.659 align:start position:0%
so we we work through the process of
 
01:42:17.629 --> 01:42:17.639 align:start position:0%
understanding what the nutrient sources
 
01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
are for every individual Lake for lakes
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
that have
 
01:42:24.109 --> 01:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
a large population around it a lot of
 
01:42:25.850 --> 01:42:25.860 align:start position:0%
development septic systems certainly
 
01:42:28.129 --> 01:42:28.139 align:start position:0%
play a large portion into the nutrient
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
loading component for nippo Lake which
 
01:42:33.290 --> 01:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
doesn't isn't heavily developed
 
01:42:35.810 --> 01:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
the loading from septic systems I was
 
01:42:37.609 --> 01:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
gonna I'm gonna estimate was around 20
 
01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
so it was you know it wasn't a large
 
01:42:42.890 --> 01:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
part of the contribution to nutrient
 
01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
loads whereas the internal load was well
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:59.330 --> 01:42:59.340 align:start position:0%
it can be from a variety of sources but
 
01:43:01.990 --> 01:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's typically historic sources
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
activities that occurred on the
 
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
landscape in the past and the release of
 
01:43:07.609 --> 01:43:07.619 align:start position:0%
the nutrients from the internal
 
01:43:10.010 --> 01:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
components from the internal sediment is
 
01:43:12.050 --> 01:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
a result of low oxygen on the bottom of
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
the water body so as representative rung
 
01:43:14.159 --> 01:43:15.470 align:start position:0%
the water body so as representative rung
mentioned

01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:43:19.090 --> 01:43:19.100 align:start position:0%
as we progress through what we like to
 
01:43:22.790 --> 01:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
refer to as climate change our water
 
01:43:25.250 --> 01:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
bodies tend to get warmer warmer water
 
01:43:27.649 --> 01:43:27.659 align:start position:0%
holds less oxygen so it's more likely
 
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
that those water bodies that experience
 
01:43:32.090 --> 01:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
low dissolved oxygen will be
 
01:43:33.890 --> 01:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
experiencing for a longer period of time
 
01:43:35.330 --> 01:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
on the bottom and there'll be more of
 
01:43:36.890 --> 01:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
those water bodies that have that
 
01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:39.669 align:start position:0%
those water bodies that have that
experience

01:43:39.669 --> 01:43:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
and I have the representative questions
 
01:43:45.530 --> 01:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
I don't see any thank you very much for
 
01:43:48.350 --> 01:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you
 
01:43:50.689 --> 01:43:50.699 align:start position:0%
it is a normal procedure to alternate
 
01:43:52.609 --> 01:43:52.619 align:start position:0%
between those in favor and those who
 
01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill I have 11 pink cards
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
here maybe more and they're all in favor
 
01:43:59.810 --> 01:43:59.820 align:start position:0%
is there anyone here that didn't fill a
 
01:44:05.090 --> 01:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:07.129 --> 01:44:07.139 align:start position:0%
seeing non-hearing none in heaven no
 
01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
pink cards uh for the against I'll go
 
01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
through those in favor I'd just ask you
 
01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
to be judicious in your testimony if
 
01:44:15.770 --> 01:44:15.780 align:start position:0%
you're repeating what somebody else said
 
01:44:18.410 --> 01:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
but love to have you testify
 
01:44:21.290 --> 01:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
so next is uh natch graze New Hampshire
 
01:44:27.649 --> 01:44:27.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:30.050 --> 01:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Nate Grace for the
 
01:44:32.090 --> 01:44:32.100 align:start position:0%
municipal Association we support this
 
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
bill and just very briefly I think that
 
01:44:36.530 --> 01:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
Des covered everything
 
01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
um that I would have had to say which is
 
01:44:40.430 --> 01:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
that this is clearly a concern for
 
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
Public Water Supplies as well as
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
recreational and economic activities of
 
01:44:47.149 --> 01:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
which municipalities are deeply
 
01:44:48.649 --> 01:44:48.659 align:start position:0%
concerned and so we are in support of
 
01:44:49.970 --> 01:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
this bill I'm happy to take any
 
01:44:52.010 --> 01:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
questions that anyone may have any
 
01:44:55.729 --> 01:44:55.739 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr Grays yes Mr Darby
 
01:44:58.729 --> 01:44:58.739 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh Mr chair thank you for
 
01:45:00.410 --> 01:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
um can you comment on what you think the
 
01:45:08.090 --> 01:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
um down the future tax implications
 
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
could be on the reduction of the tax
 
01:45:16.370 --> 01:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
base if the you know if the recreational
 
01:45:19.609 --> 01:45:19.619 align:start position:0%
value diminishes in um has have you
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
received that uh feedback from Matt from
 
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
any of the municipalities you support or
 
01:45:25.850 --> 01:45:25.860 align:start position:0%
represents so I don't have any
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
particular data on that but as everyone
 
01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
in this room knows a number of
 
01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
municipalities rely heavily on tourism
 
01:45:36.590 --> 01:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
to drive a large part of their uh their
 
01:45:39.070 --> 01:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
tax base and you know everything from
 
01:45:43.729 --> 01:45:43.739 align:start position:0%
rentals to to shops and uh and that
 
01:45:45.410 --> 01:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
obviously goes into what the property
 
01:45:47.209 --> 01:45:47.219 align:start position:0%
values are
 
01:45:49.330 --> 01:45:49.340 align:start position:0%
um which is the basis for our tax system
 
01:45:52.490 --> 01:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
and a large part of that uh for a number
 
01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
of municipalities is because they're
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
along lakes and lakes that are you for
 
01:45:57.649 --> 01:45:57.659 align:start position:0%
recreational activities like Lake
 
01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee and obviously if it
 
01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
becomes the case that that that water
 
01:46:04.850 --> 01:46:04.860 align:start position:0%
body or other large water bodies that
 
01:46:07.970 --> 01:46:07.980 align:start position:0%
are recreational hubs are no longer
 
01:46:09.890 --> 01:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
useful for a portion of the year because
 
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
of cyanobacteria contamination that's
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
going to be a serious problem for the
 
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
tax base and the valuation of those
 
01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:18.770 align:start position:0%
tax base and the valuation of those
properties

01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
properties
 
01:46:20.810 --> 01:46:20.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:23.689 --> 01:46:23.699 align:start position:0%
any other questions from Mr grays
 
01:46:25.609 --> 01:46:25.619 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:46:27.530 --> 01:46:27.540 align:start position:0%

on that Lake
 
01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
I'd like to tell you a story about Lake

acres
 
01:47:13.129 --> 01:47:13.139 align:start position:0%
it's got a perimeter of three miles it's
 
01:47:15.770 --> 01:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
got an average depth of 12 feet
 
01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
it has really no active inflow or
 
01:47:21.050 --> 01:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
outflow and so it sits there like the
 
01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
old Glacier that it used to be fed by
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
some spring water and perhaps some rain
 
01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:26.870 align:start position:0%

certainly

01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:47:30.050 --> 01:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
but over the years in fact 27 years in a
 
01:47:32.330 --> 01:47:32.340 align:start position:0%
row Our Lake Association has been very
 
01:47:34.850 --> 01:47:34.860 align:start position:0%
diligent in testing the water through
 
01:47:36.250 --> 01:47:36.260 align:start position:0%

uh and that of course looks for not only
 
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
bacteria and invasive species but tests
 
01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
the quality of the water with regard to
 
01:47:52.010 --> 01:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
phosphorus and runoff and many other
 
01:47:54.590 --> 01:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
things to assess the clarity of the lake
 
01:47:57.229 --> 01:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
and we have remained an oligotrophic
 
01:47:59.149 --> 01:47:59.159 align:start position:0%
Lake which is the highest quality of
 
01:48:02.689 --> 01:48:02.699 align:start position:0%
water that is possible
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
every year at our Lake Association
 
01:48:06.530 --> 01:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
meeting we go over the elements how do
 
01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
you preserve the quality of this Lake
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
not only for our property values but for
 
01:48:13.490 --> 01:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
all the safety of the people who come to
 
01:48:15.470 --> 01:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
visit the lake and want to swim
 
01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have a lot of large boat
 
01:48:20.209 --> 01:48:20.219 align:start position:0%

Lake
 
01:48:31.729 --> 01:48:31.739 align:start position:0%
and we were just there enjoying that
 
01:48:35.450 --> 01:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
beautiful water until two years ago
 
01:48:38.450 --> 01:48:38.460 align:start position:0%
and to no one's to everyone's surprise
 
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
we saw this green scum on the lake
 
01:48:43.790 --> 01:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
how could this happen in our Clear Lake
 
01:48:47.149 --> 01:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
which we are so diligent in surveying
 
01:48:49.250 --> 01:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't just one location it was
 
01:48:51.250 --> 01:48:51.260 align:start position:0%
several we really didn't know much about
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria except that we knew that
 
01:48:57.050 --> 01:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
it had potential toxicity
 
01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
and so we got a cyanobacteria alert we
 
01:49:02.450 --> 01:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
stayed out of the water for a couple of
 
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
weeks we didn't know whether it was
 
01:49:06.830 --> 01:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
toxic or not really changed our life for
 
01:49:08.209 --> 01:49:08.219 align:start position:0%
that summer
 
01:49:10.850 --> 01:49:10.860 align:start position:0%
fortunately for us the cyanobacteria
 
01:49:14.689 --> 01:49:14.699 align:start position:0%
blooms disappeared no one no animals
 
01:49:17.209 --> 01:49:17.219 align:start position:0%
nothing that we know of was affected by
 
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
the toxicity
 
01:49:21.590 --> 01:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
but that was a real heads up for us why
 
01:49:23.330 --> 01:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
should our small Lake
 
01:49:26.330 --> 01:49:26.340 align:start position:0%
be subject to cyanobacteria and we're
 
01:49:29.149 --> 01:49:29.159 align:start position:0%
still learning more about this
 
01:49:30.890 --> 01:49:30.900 align:start position:0%
when the discussion came up well what
 
01:49:32.330 --> 01:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
are we going to do if we can't clear
 
01:49:34.370 --> 01:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
this we said well we're going to have to
 
01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
do something and we looked at our budget
 
01:49:39.950 --> 01:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen the budget as has
 
01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
been alluded to for our Lake Association
 
01:49:45.530 --> 01:49:45.540 align:start position:0%
is minuscule you're hearing numbers like
 
01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
we go to four figures at most and that's
 
01:49:53.209 --> 01:49:53.219 align:start position:0%
pretty typical I think for a small Lake
 
01:49:55.850 --> 01:49:55.860 align:start position:0%
Our Lake would be devastated if we had a
 
01:49:59.149 --> 01:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
a cyanobacteria infestation that really
 
01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
didn't clear on its own
 
01:50:04.729 --> 01:50:04.739 align:start position:0%
to talk to the board of Selectmen at the
 
01:50:07.609 --> 01:50:07.619 align:start position:0%
town of Webster would be a real exercise
 
01:50:10.430 --> 01:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't know what but I'm not sure
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
that that would really get us anywhere
 
01:50:13.850 --> 01:50:13.860 align:start position:0%
near the amount of money that we would
 
01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:15.109 align:start position:0%
near the amount of money that we would
need

01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:50:19.609 --> 01:50:19.619 align:start position:0%
so to make to to be very succinct about
 
01:50:19.619 --> 01:50:20.450 align:start position:0%
so to make to to be very succinct about
it

01:50:20.450 --> 01:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:50:22.850 --> 01:50:22.860 align:start position:0%
establishing a fund of this nature and I
 
01:50:24.649 --> 01:50:24.659 align:start position:0%
think I can speak for many of the
 
01:50:27.169 --> 01:50:27.179 align:start position:0%
smaller lakes in this state would be a
 
01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
wonderful opportunity for us to at least
 
01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:30.470 align:start position:0%
wonderful opportunity for us to at least
apply

01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
apply
 
01:50:32.930 --> 01:50:32.940 align:start position:0%
for some financial help
 
01:50:36.109 --> 01:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
to to mitigate the consequences of
 
01:50:36.119 --> 01:50:38.470 align:start position:0%
to to mitigate the consequences of
cyanobacteria

01:50:38.470 --> 01:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria
 
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
moreover I think it's it sends a
 
01:50:45.950 --> 01:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
reputation of responsibility
 
01:50:48.410 --> 01:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire which
 
01:50:50.270 --> 01:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
could really go out beyond our state
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
boundaries about how responsible we feel
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
we should be about the quality of our
 
01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:56.149 align:start position:0%
we should be about the quality of our
Lake

01:50:56.149 --> 01:50:56.159 align:start position:0%
Lake
 
01:50:57.770 --> 01:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
and don't ever doubt that that's
 
01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
important in Massachusetts and Vermont
 
01:51:01.850 --> 01:51:01.860 align:start position:0%
and New York and every place else that
 
01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
comes to visit us in the summertime it
 
01:51:06.350 --> 01:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
shows a real sense of responsibility and
 
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
01:51:12.770 --> 01:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:15.169 --> 01:51:15.179 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions anyone

very much for your testimony
 
01:51:25.370 --> 01:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering if you have ever
 
01:51:28.250 --> 01:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
heard of the cyanotoxin monitoring
 
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
equipment and training Grant
 
01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:32.149 align:start position:0%
equipment and training Grant
that

01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:36.250 --> 01:51:36.260 align:start position:0%
new ant New Hampshire Des uh
 
01:51:39.950 --> 01:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
administers to which helps with this
 
01:51:41.930 --> 01:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
sort of thing thank you
 
01:51:45.050 --> 01:51:45.060 align:start position:0%
I can't speak excuse me specifically to
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
that particular one I do know that there
 
01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:48.550 align:start position:0%
that particular one I do know that there
are

01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:51:52.250 --> 01:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
ways to analyze the cyanobacteria and
 
01:51:55.310 --> 01:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
analyze its toxicity
 
01:51:58.010 --> 01:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
and that's nice they can come out and
 
01:51:59.689 --> 01:51:59.699 align:start position:0%
test to see if the stuff is really
 
01:52:02.510 --> 01:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
poisonous or not
 
01:52:05.149 --> 01:52:05.159 align:start position:0%
um but by the time that happens you've
 
01:52:07.129 --> 01:52:07.139 align:start position:0%
already had your Bloom and blooms can
 
01:52:09.290 --> 01:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
change over time the biology these
 
01:52:11.689 --> 01:52:11.699 align:start position:0%
blooms were still working out I look at
 
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
that as a way to document the relative
 
01:52:16.250 --> 01:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
safety levels of going into the water
 
01:52:19.070 --> 01:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
which is nice to know but it doesn't
 
01:52:21.950 --> 01:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
really address the um the existence of
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
this particular organism in the water
 
01:52:27.530 --> 01:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh I can't speak as a scientist at DES
 
01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
but I do know those those testing
 
01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:38.270 --> 01:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
representative wolf
 
01:52:40.189 --> 01:52:40.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:52:42.109 --> 01:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:52:45.169 --> 01:52:45.179 align:start position:0%
um this bill is
 
01:52:48.790 --> 01:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
um called a Loan Fund for
 
01:52:52.129 --> 01:52:52.139 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria mitigation investigation
 
01:52:52.139 --> 01:52:52.930 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria mitigation investigation
Etc

01:52:52.930 --> 01:52:52.940 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:52:56.510 --> 01:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
it also specifies that it may go to
 
01:53:00.070 --> 01:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
Lakes association's non-profits Etc
 
01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
loan to me means repayment now maybe it
 
01:53:07.250 --> 01:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
should be renamed a grant program but
 
01:53:10.910 --> 01:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
what is the protection for the state on
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
getting the loan repaid
 
01:53:15.169 --> 01:53:15.179 align:start position:0%
I don't think that I'm in a position to
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
answer that question I appreciate your
 
01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:17.629 align:start position:0%
answer that question I appreciate your
question

01:53:17.629 --> 01:53:17.639 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:53:20.209 --> 01:53:20.219 align:start position:0%
I look at this as the president of my
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
local Lake Association
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
as an opportunity to apply for money to
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
help mitigate the spread and the
 
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
potential worsening of this in our Lake
 
01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
and that our lake is just a prototype
 
01:53:39.070 --> 01:53:39.080 align:start position:0%
I'll be frank with you the Lake
 
01:53:42.350 --> 01:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
winnipocket Conservation Association has
 
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
no way to repay a loan of this type
 
01:53:49.669 --> 01:53:49.679 align:start position:0%
but this is not our Lake we just live
 
01:53:49.679 --> 01:53:50.510 align:start position:0%
but this is not our Lake we just live
there

01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
this is the lake in the town of Webster
 
01:53:54.109 --> 01:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire which
 
01:53:56.510 --> 01:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
serves really a wider Community than the
 
01:53:58.189 --> 01:53:58.199 align:start position:0%
homeowners around
 
01:54:00.890 --> 01:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
and so my opinion would be it's not
 
01:54:02.649 --> 01:54:02.659 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:54:05.810 --> 01:54:05.820 align:start position:0%
imperative that the borrowers or the the
 
01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
applicants for this money are have to
 
01:54:11.149 --> 01:54:11.159 align:start position:0%
pay it back first of all it isn't going
 
01:54:12.770 --> 01:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
to happen secondly I don't think it's
 
01:54:15.169 --> 01:54:15.179 align:start position:0%
really the direction that we really want
 
01:54:21.770 --> 01:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
just to follow up on your follow-up
 
01:54:27.050 --> 01:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
thank you uh then it may be more
 
01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:28.970 align:start position:0%
thank you uh then it may be more
appropriate

01:54:28.970 --> 01:54:28.980 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:54:32.689 --> 01:54:32.699 align:start position:0%
to call it what if in reality is going
 
01:54:36.109 --> 01:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
to be is a grant program
 
01:54:41.930 --> 01:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
representative Darby
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
um have you approached the town of
 
01:54:51.950 --> 01:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
Webster and since municipalities can
 
01:54:53.870 --> 01:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
take out the loans
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
um is uh would you consider going to the
 
01:54:58.910 --> 01:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
town of Webster and seeing if they would
 
01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
take out the loan on your behalf thank
 
01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
you for the question absolutely yes
 
01:55:06.530 --> 01:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
Tyler Webster has a lot invested in Lee
 
01:55:09.770 --> 01:55:09.780 align:start position:0%
quarter pocket it's far and away the
 
01:55:11.689 --> 01:55:11.699 align:start position:0%
greatest source of tax revenue for the
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
town of Webster
 
01:55:15.590 --> 01:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh have we done so yet
 
01:55:18.530 --> 01:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
not yet but you know I don't want to I
 
01:55:20.090 --> 01:55:20.100 align:start position:0%
don't want to go there without getting
 
01:55:22.370 --> 01:55:22.380 align:start position:0%
the facts so to speak as Joe Friday used
 
01:55:25.010 --> 01:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
to say I'm really uh interested in what
 
01:55:27.050 --> 01:55:27.060 align:start position:0%
this committee is going to come up with
 
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
and how this legislation is going to go
 
01:55:32.450 --> 01:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
I believe that if the committee sees fit
 
01:55:34.430 --> 01:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
to put some sort of a bill like this
 
01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679 align:start position:0%
through that's going to make the town of
 
01:55:39.530 --> 01:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
Webster a lot more willing to
 
01:55:41.450 --> 01:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
participate if they think they're going
 
01:55:44.689 --> 01:55:44.699 align:start position:0%
to have to fund that 500 000 mitigation
 
01:55:45.950 --> 01:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
on their own
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to say well you look you
 
01:55:49.129 --> 01:55:49.139 align:start position:0%
guys live around the lake you got a lot
 
01:55:50.810 --> 01:55:50.820 align:start position:0%
of money why don't you I can just hear
 
01:55:52.910 --> 01:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
the discussion now I'm not sure where
 
01:55:56.209 --> 01:55:56.219 align:start position:0%
I'm going with this but to say yes we
 
01:55:57.770 --> 01:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
certainly will talk to the town of
 
01:55:59.810 --> 01:55:59.820 align:start position:0%
Webster selectman and get them involved
 
01:56:02.930 --> 01:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
and participate both emotionally and
 
01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:04.609 align:start position:0%
and participate both emotionally and
financially

01:56:04.609 --> 01:56:04.619 align:start position:0%
financially
 
01:56:06.530 --> 01:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
any more questions from the
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
representatives hearing none thank you
 
01:56:12.890 --> 01:56:12.900 align:start position:0%
uh for your testimony thank you very
 
01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:18.530 align:start position:0%
uh for your testimony thank you very
much

01:56:18.530 --> 01:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:20.930 --> 01:56:20.940 align:start position:0%
Norm Royce
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
Northern Lake watershed
 
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:36.290 --> 01:56:36.300 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you for your time
 
01:56:38.390 --> 01:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
this morning my name is Norm Royce I'm
 
01:56:39.770 --> 01:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
the president of the Northwood Lake
 
01:56:41.750 --> 01:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
Watershed Association
 
01:56:45.050 --> 01:56:45.060 align:start position:0%
our mission is to mitigate aquatic
 
01:56:48.770 --> 01:56:48.780 align:start position:0%
invasive species so cyanobacteria is not
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
in our mission
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of fundraising we raise
 
01:56:55.070 --> 01:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
about fifty thousand dollars a year we
 
01:56:56.810 --> 01:56:56.820 align:start position:0%
have several different streams of
 
01:56:58.669 --> 01:56:58.679 align:start position:0%
fundraising activity it's residents
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
around the lake uh the three towns that
 
01:57:03.709 --> 01:57:03.719 align:start position:0%
border the lake we have a warrant
 
01:57:06.109 --> 01:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
article on all three towns to request
 
01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
funds local businesses and then state
 
01:57:11.090 --> 01:57:11.100 align:start position:0%
grants through the assistance and
 
01:57:13.609 --> 01:57:13.619 align:start position:0%
coordination with New Hampshire Des
 
01:57:16.010 --> 01:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
we have no money in our fundraising
 
01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:17.149 align:start position:0%
we have no money in our fundraising
capability

01:57:17.149 --> 01:57:17.159 align:start position:0%
capability
 
01:57:20.330 --> 01:57:20.340 align:start position:0%
to either communicate the risks around
 
01:57:20.340 --> 01:57:21.950 align:start position:0%
to either communicate the risks around
cyanobacteria

01:57:21.950 --> 01:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria
 
01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
what folks should be doing to help
 
01:57:27.109 --> 01:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
prevent it or to manage cyanobacterial
 
01:57:29.030 --> 01:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
outbreaks on Northwood Lake
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
historically we had not seen
 
01:57:34.129 --> 01:57:34.139 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria on Northwood Lake until
 
01:57:36.830 --> 01:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
the last couple years we had an event
 
01:57:39.649 --> 01:57:39.659 align:start position:0%
and then we had two events and then we
 
01:57:42.050 --> 01:57:42.060 align:start position:0%
had multiple events so it seems like
 
01:57:44.270 --> 01:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
each year it's becoming more and more of
 
01:57:45.649 --> 01:57:45.659 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
we work closely with New Hampshire Des
 
01:57:49.850 --> 01:57:49.860 align:start position:0%
I'm really impressed with New Hampshire
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
Des front line resources
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire Des is under-resourced
 
01:57:58.250 --> 01:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
and all those folks on the front line
 
01:58:00.830 --> 01:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
help us they help us right away they
 
01:58:03.890 --> 01:58:03.900 align:start position:0%
have great skill they show passion in
 
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
the work that they do but there's just
 
01:58:08.570 --> 01:58:08.580 align:start position:0%
not enough resources to help what we do
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
for us from my view in Northwood Lake
 
01:58:14.209 --> 01:58:14.219 align:start position:0%
watershed's View communication right now
 
01:58:17.149 --> 01:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
is really key with cyanobacteria you
 
01:58:18.410 --> 01:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
know lake living
 
01:58:18.420 --> 01:58:19.010 align:start position:0%
know lake living
um

01:58:19.010 --> 01:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:21.290 --> 01:58:21.300 align:start position:0%
Northwood like many lakes in New
 
01:58:21.300 --> 01:58:22.270 align:start position:0%
Northwood like many lakes in New
Hampshire

01:58:22.270 --> 01:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:58:25.370 --> 01:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
historically had small old Cottages
 
01:58:28.609 --> 01:58:28.619 align:start position:0%
built on postage stamp Lots those are
 
01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
being purchased and torn down and
 
01:58:33.290 --> 01:58:33.300 align:start position:0%
beautiful new homes are being built I
 
01:58:35.450 --> 01:58:35.460 align:start position:0%
did the same I built my new home four
 
01:58:36.589 --> 01:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:58:39.530 --> 01:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
I had the benefit of being a member of
 
01:58:41.689 --> 01:58:41.699 align:start position:0%
the Northwood Lake Watershed and
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
understanding my new build and the
 
01:58:47.330 --> 01:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
impact that what I chose to do with my
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
build on the lake would impact the
 
01:58:51.770 --> 01:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
quality level of the lake and things
 
01:58:54.050 --> 01:58:54.060 align:start position:0%
like cyanobacteria
 
01:58:56.810 --> 01:58:56.820 align:start position:0%
so people tearing down new homes
 
01:59:00.290 --> 01:59:00.300 align:start position:0%
and tearing down the shoreline buffer
 
01:59:02.930 --> 01:59:02.940 align:start position:0%
zone tearing up plants cutting down
 
01:59:05.570 --> 01:59:05.580 align:start position:0%
trees and then putting in big beautiful
 
01:59:08.390 --> 01:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
grass Lawns that they fertilize with
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
phosphate even though it's against the
 
01:59:14.750 --> 01:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
law I'll contribute to the chemical feed
 
01:59:18.589 --> 01:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
of cyanobacteria and having it grow
 
01:59:21.649 --> 01:59:21.659 align:start position:0%
um you know when we experience an event
 
01:59:23.810 --> 01:59:23.820 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire DS helps us with our
 
01:59:26.270 --> 01:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
communication and it would go something
 
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
like this you know we put out a notice
 
01:59:30.050 --> 01:59:30.060 align:start position:0%
Northwood Lake just experienced that for
 
01:59:33.050 --> 01:59:33.060 align:start position:0%
us cyanobacteria bloom for 2022.
 
01:59:35.450 --> 01:59:35.460 align:start position:0%
typically it's on one of the hottest
 
01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
days of the summer you know people are
 
01:59:39.709 --> 01:59:39.719 align:start position:0%
excited I live on a lake we're going to
 
01:59:41.510 --> 01:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
go out boating and swimming and water
 
01:59:43.189 --> 01:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
skiing and our family and friends are
 
01:59:46.070 --> 01:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
going to come over and we tell them stay
 
01:59:49.070 --> 01:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
out of the lake until we can sample what
 
01:59:51.950 --> 01:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
it is sample the severity of it and then
 
01:59:53.810 --> 01:59:53.820 align:start position:0%
we'll communicate back to you as it
 
01:59:55.609 --> 01:59:55.619 align:start position:0%
clears when you can get back into the
 
01:59:58.129 --> 01:59:58.139 align:start position:0%
water so obviously not a very very good
 
02:00:02.350 --> 02:00:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:06.109 --> 02:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
one of the communication efforts that we
 
02:00:09.410 --> 02:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
have as a Lake Association is we not
 
02:00:11.209 --> 02:00:11.219 align:start position:0%
just tell people that we had a bloom but
 
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
we tell them what they can do to prevent
 
02:00:15.470 --> 02:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms and again this
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
information comes to us through the
 
02:00:21.169 --> 02:00:21.179 align:start position:0%
support of both New Hampshire des and
 
02:00:22.669 --> 02:00:22.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Lakes
 
02:00:25.250 --> 02:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
and we asked you know have they had a
 
02:00:27.229 --> 02:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
septic system inspection not just pump
 
02:00:28.729 --> 02:00:28.739 align:start position:0%
your septic system make sure it's
 
02:00:31.370 --> 02:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
inspected every couple of years to make
 
02:00:33.530 --> 02:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
sure it's functioning properly and and
 
02:00:36.050 --> 02:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
not contributing to the problem we
 
02:00:38.089 --> 02:00:38.099 align:start position:0%
advise them don't fertilize your lawn
 
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
within 25 feet of the water and we
 
02:00:41.450 --> 02:00:41.460 align:start position:0%
remind them that this is a law in New
 
02:00:45.169 --> 02:00:45.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Beyond 25 feet don't use
 
02:00:47.930 --> 02:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
phosphate fertilizers and we share with
 
02:00:49.790 --> 02:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
them that our local hardware store has
 
02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
the right fertilizer that they could use
 
02:00:54.890 --> 02:00:54.900 align:start position:0%
we remind them to responsibly prune
 
02:00:57.169 --> 02:00:57.179 align:start position:0%
along the shoreline keep as many native
 
02:00:59.930 --> 02:00:59.940 align:start position:0%
plants as they can we have to you know
 
02:01:02.330 --> 02:01:02.340 align:start position:0%
remind them about their parking surface
 
02:01:04.609 --> 02:01:04.619 align:start position:0%
areas and access areas and understand
 
02:01:06.890 --> 02:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
where runoff is going on their property
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
and that it's not going directly into
 
02:01:11.169 --> 02:01:11.179 align:start position:0%
the lake but it's being diverted
 
02:01:13.970 --> 02:01:13.980 align:start position:0%
and then you know a couple other things
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
I think the uh the other thing that I
 
02:01:19.250 --> 02:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure I mentioned is
 
02:01:21.290 --> 02:01:21.300 align:start position:0%
um again you know communication is key
 
02:01:23.450 --> 02:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Lakes they have a couple
 
02:01:25.550 --> 02:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
of great programs they have this Lake
 
02:01:27.950 --> 02:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
smart program that talks about lake
 
02:01:30.350 --> 02:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
living and really the expectations that
 
02:01:31.970 --> 02:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
all of us that live on or near Lakes
 
02:01:34.010 --> 02:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
have as a responsibility
 
02:01:36.290 --> 02:01:36.300 align:start position:0%
they also ran what was called the late
 
02:01:38.450 --> 02:01:38.460 align:start position:0%
Congress in conjunction with New
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire DES in conjunction with an
 
02:01:44.330 --> 02:01:44.340 align:start position:0%
awful lot of suppliers contractors that
 
02:01:47.169 --> 02:01:47.179 align:start position:0%
can help with how to live along a lake
 
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
and in that late Congress they did a
 
02:01:54.129 --> 02:01:54.139 align:start position:0%
great job communicating
 
02:01:57.229 --> 02:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria and what it is how long
 
02:01:59.510 --> 02:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's been around how cyanobacteria
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
blooms but that was to those of us that
 
02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
were able to attend Lake Congress we've
 
02:02:07.310 --> 02:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
got to get this word out to everybody in
 
02:02:09.410 --> 02:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that lives near or on a
 
02:02:12.290 --> 02:02:12.300 align:start position:0%
lake and just in closing I wanted to
 
02:02:14.209 --> 02:02:14.219 align:start position:0%
mention you know listening to the costs
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
associated with the cyanobacteria
 
02:02:19.729 --> 02:02:19.739 align:start position:0%
concerns on nipple lake nippo lake is 85
 
02:02:21.169 --> 02:02:21.179 align:start position:0%
Acres so I looked it up while I was
 
02:02:22.430 --> 02:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
waiting to speak
 
02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
Northwood lake is 653 Acres
 
02:02:27.649 --> 02:02:27.659 align:start position:0%
the funds that we raise
 
02:02:30.589 --> 02:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
we barely cover the milfoil mitigation
 
02:02:33.770 --> 02:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
we really don't have any capability to
 
02:02:36.109 --> 02:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
raise additional funds either through
 
02:02:38.930 --> 02:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
town warrant articles or through the
 
02:02:41.390 --> 02:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
residents in and along the lake and in
 
02:02:44.510 --> 02:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
the Watershed to be able to to mitigate
 
02:02:46.609 --> 02:02:46.619 align:start position:0%
if Northwood Lake was that serious as
 
02:02:48.050 --> 02:02:48.060 align:start position:0%
nipple Lake that we had to go through
 
02:02:49.970 --> 02:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
some of the treatments described
 
02:02:52.430 --> 02:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
so that's the information I wanted to
 
02:02:55.370 --> 02:02:55.380 align:start position:0%
share I think this bill is essential we
 
02:02:58.189 --> 02:02:58.199 align:start position:0%
had invited congresswoman rung to our
 
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
annual meeting last year where she
 
02:03:01.669 --> 02:03:01.679 align:start position:0%
shared with the residents in Northwood
 
02:03:04.430 --> 02:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
the concerns about cyanobacteria we just
 
02:03:06.350 --> 02:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
think it's such a significant thing in
 
02:03:08.689 --> 02:03:08.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the time to address it
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
is now we don't want to wait a couple
 
02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:11.990 align:start position:0%
is now we don't want to wait a couple
years

02:03:11.990 --> 02:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:12.709 align:start position:0%
years
um

02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll look just close
 
02:03:20.030 --> 02:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:21.890 --> 02:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:03:24.109 --> 02:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone for your time
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
actually caught me sneaking out the door
 
02:03:36.770 --> 02:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
uh thanks for the opportunity to get in
 
02:03:38.270 --> 02:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
front of you again
 
02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
um I did mention the prior testimony
 
02:03:43.250 --> 02:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
that uh my name is Boyd Smith I'm with
 
02:03:44.750 --> 02:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
the director of the New Hampshire Water
 
02:03:47.930 --> 02:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
Works Association uh I mentioned that we
 
02:03:47.940 --> 02:03:48.649 align:start position:0%
Works Association uh I mentioned that we
had

02:03:48.649 --> 02:03:48.659 align:start position:0%
had
 
02:03:50.810 --> 02:03:50.820 align:start position:0%
um that we represent the public water
 
02:03:53.689 --> 02:03:53.699 align:start position:0%
drinking water sector in the state and
 
02:03:55.430 --> 02:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
that totals up to a little more than 300
 
02:03:56.930 --> 02:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
members many represented by
 
02:04:00.350 --> 02:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh and others in in the
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
Consulting and design world
 
02:04:05.209 --> 02:04:05.219 align:start position:0%
so um our takea oh prior that my prior
 
02:04:06.589 --> 02:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
life though I was working at Newfound
 
02:04:09.290 --> 02:04:09.300 align:start position:0%
Lake as the Director where we ran what I
 
02:04:11.450 --> 02:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
think at the time was the largest
 
02:04:13.609 --> 02:04:13.619 align:start position:0%
watershed management plan in the state
 
02:04:15.890 --> 02:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
and it's had a great time learning about
 
02:04:18.109 --> 02:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
that stuff and working with the folks so
 
02:04:20.510 --> 02:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
um I just say the short short version is
 
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
we support this uh understand where
 
02:04:25.010 --> 02:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
we're going to find the money is always
 
02:04:27.370 --> 02:04:27.380 align:start position:0%
a question the Waters of the state
 
02:04:30.290 --> 02:04:30.300 align:start position:0%
whether for drinking water or for
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
recreation generate
 
02:04:34.609 --> 02:04:34.619 align:start position:0%
north of a billion I'm guessing more
 
02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
like two billion dollars a year uh in in
 
02:04:39.950 --> 02:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue so we as a state I think it's
 
02:04:42.350 --> 02:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
well within our sort of moral compass
 
02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
and hopefully within our budget to take
 
02:04:47.030 --> 02:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
care of something that provides so much
 
02:04:50.209 --> 02:04:50.219 align:start position:0%
uh to so many this one other thought on
 
02:04:52.970 --> 02:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
the drinking water side is
 
02:04:52.980 --> 02:04:54.169 align:start position:0%
the drinking water side is
um

02:04:54.169 --> 02:04:54.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:56.510 --> 02:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
public water serves roughly 54 percent
 
02:04:58.850 --> 02:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
of the population
 
02:05:01.129 --> 02:05:01.139 align:start position:0%
in the state so 600 something thousand
 
02:05:02.750 --> 02:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
seven hundred thousand people
 
02:05:04.550 --> 02:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
out of that
 
02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:06.229 align:start position:0%
out of that
um

02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:08.270 --> 02:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
so it's like
 
02:05:10.790 --> 02:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
50 percent of the total population is
 
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
served by just a handful of systems you
 
02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
know most of our systems are small so
 
02:05:16.129 --> 02:05:16.139 align:start position:0%
the bigger systems you mentioned in
 
02:05:18.649 --> 02:05:18.659 align:start position:0%
Nashua and pennichuck and they depend
 
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
almost exclusively on surface water so
 
02:05:23.510 --> 02:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
whether pulling out a canopy lake or
 
02:05:25.970 --> 02:05:25.980 align:start position:0%
mass obesic the Merrimack River is is a
 
02:05:28.010 --> 02:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
huge source and obviously a long-term
 
02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
source for the state
 
02:05:32.330 --> 02:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
this is where the cyanobacteria blooms
 
02:05:34.609 --> 02:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
are showing and it's a problem that's
 
02:05:36.530 --> 02:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
systemic that we have to deal with so
 
02:05:39.410 --> 02:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
from a drinking water perspective taking
 
02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
care of our source Waters the guys say
 
02:05:43.070 --> 02:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
if you you know if you don't have it to
 
02:05:45.470 --> 02:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
treat you know you don't have it
 
02:05:47.209 --> 02:05:47.219 align:start position:0%
um top of that the recreational benefit
 
02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
but anyway we fully support this
 
02:05:51.890 --> 02:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
protecting our source Waters and I'd be
 
02:05:53.450 --> 02:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
02:05:56.689 --> 02:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for Mr Smith
 
02:05:58.669 --> 02:05:58.679 align:start position:0%
representative Darby
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:06:02.450 --> 02:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
my question did did I understand that
 
02:06:05.209 --> 02:06:05.219 align:start position:0%
you in in a previous role
 
02:06:08.089 --> 02:06:08.099 align:start position:0%
um or part of a Lake Association
 
02:06:11.450 --> 02:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
um that uh managed that ran a watershed
 
02:06:14.209 --> 02:06:14.219 align:start position:0%
management plan and if you if that's the
 
02:06:16.550 --> 02:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
case can you describe how you
 
02:06:19.370 --> 02:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
coordinated the funds and how you um how
 
02:06:21.290 --> 02:06:21.300 align:start position:0%
you basically interacted with all the
 
02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:22.490 align:start position:0%
you basically interacted with all the
parties

02:06:22.490 --> 02:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
parties
 
02:06:24.229 --> 02:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
um that you needed to disperse those
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
funds to the private the private parties
 
02:06:29.109 --> 02:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned in a previous question
 
02:06:31.310 --> 02:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
sure I'll give that a shot and I'll try
 
02:06:33.950 --> 02:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
and be succinct so um I was the director
 
02:06:36.109 --> 02:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
of the Newfound Lake Region Association
 
02:06:38.450 --> 02:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
uh Scott Newfound Lake and it's a
 
02:06:41.810 --> 02:06:41.820 align:start position:0%
ligatrophic Class A 4500 acres and a 65
 
02:06:44.330 --> 02:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
000 acre Watershed so it's about a 15 to
 
02:06:46.970 --> 02:06:46.980 align:start position:0%
1 land to water ratio the funding that
 
02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
we received was EPA section 319 funding
 
02:06:52.189 --> 02:06:52.199 align:start position:0%

Bureau
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
um we came in uh initially as planning
 
02:06:59.209 --> 02:06:59.219 align:start position:0%
grants which I think a lot of folks are
 
02:07:00.890 --> 02:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
talking about the value of understanding
 
02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh your system and what what the issues
 
02:07:07.010 --> 02:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
are and how you might manage them uh we
 
02:07:09.169 --> 02:07:09.179 align:start position:0%
manage the grant we project Managed IT
 
02:07:11.689 --> 02:07:11.699 align:start position:0%
and we're like the local face on the you
 
02:07:13.490 --> 02:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
know the position on the ground there's
 
02:07:15.169 --> 02:07:15.179 align:start position:0%
basically five towns surrounding
 
02:07:17.810 --> 02:07:17.820 align:start position:0%
Newfound that are on the waterfront so
 
02:07:19.609 --> 02:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
five different basically small New
 
02:07:22.490 --> 02:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire towns and then passed a large
 
02:07:23.689 --> 02:07:23.699 align:start position:0%
amount of money through to
 
02:07:26.270 --> 02:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
subcontractors typically between uh
 
02:07:28.370 --> 02:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
sorry um
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
60 and 70 percent anyway or more of the
 
02:07:33.470 --> 02:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
grant funds went to subs and we did
 
02:07:35.629 --> 02:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
things like land use analysis a very
 
02:07:37.629 --> 02:07:37.639 align:start position:0%
detailed GIS mapping
 
02:07:40.970 --> 02:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
demographics growth percentages of land
 
02:07:40.980 --> 02:07:42.649 align:start position:0%
demographics growth percentages of land
cover

02:07:42.649 --> 02:07:42.659 align:start position:0%
cover
 
02:07:42.659 --> 02:07:44.390 align:start position:0%
cover
um

02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:46.550 --> 02:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of water quality monitoring near
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
shore and deeper water to look at Trends
 
02:07:50.450 --> 02:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
we saw some of these Trends now this
 
02:07:51.770 --> 02:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
data is getting on you know five or
 
02:07:53.270 --> 02:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
seven years old but we saw some of these
 
02:07:55.070 --> 02:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
Trends you're hearing about and we
 
02:07:56.930 --> 02:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
started rolling into implementation
 
02:08:00.050 --> 02:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
which is the way the EPA Pro program is
 
02:08:02.390 --> 02:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
set up you have to have a plan but then
 
02:08:04.189 --> 02:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
you've got to implement on that plan so
 
02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a sequential thing and the
 
02:08:08.930 --> 02:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
main things you got to deal with are
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
land use as you've heard it's it's
 
02:08:13.850 --> 02:08:13.860 align:start position:0%
non-point source pollution so there's a
 
02:08:16.250 --> 02:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
variety of sources dirt roads you know
 
02:08:17.689 --> 02:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
are big right and everybody's got dirt
 
02:08:19.970 --> 02:08:19.980 align:start position:0%
roads waterfront property how you manage
 
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
your your vegetation down to the water's
 
02:08:24.350 --> 02:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
edge the riparian buffer that's really
 
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
critical so when you start flipping into
 
02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
that there's some areas you can deal
 
02:08:30.050 --> 02:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
with projects so we did some big storm
 
02:08:31.970 --> 02:08:31.980 align:start position:0%
water projects that both were effective
 
02:08:34.609 --> 02:08:34.619 align:start position:0%
and they provided demonstrations but
 
02:08:35.990 --> 02:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
you're getting into land use management
 
02:08:39.109 --> 02:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
now you're flipping into a town zoning
 
02:08:41.149 --> 02:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
and planning and enforcement issues
 
02:08:44.330 --> 02:08:44.340 align:start position:0%
around use of private property and the
 
02:08:46.209 --> 02:08:46.219 align:start position:0%
fella talking about
 
02:08:46.219 --> 02:08:48.370 align:start position:0%
fella talking about
Winnipesaukee

02:08:48.370 --> 02:08:48.380 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee
 
02:08:51.290 --> 02:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
winnipocket I I can relate to them it's
 
02:08:54.229 --> 02:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
a tough conversation to have
 
02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
um so you know we we did a number of
 
02:08:58.609 --> 02:08:58.619 align:start position:0%
projects I think uh they're continuing
 
02:08:59.930 --> 02:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
to do them up there it's been three
 
02:09:01.550 --> 02:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
years since I've been there it's an
 
02:09:05.330 --> 02:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
ongoing thing and I guess I would say I
 
02:09:07.010 --> 02:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
think representative wrong mentioned you
 
02:09:08.209 --> 02:09:08.219 align:start position:0%
know we can't control the temperature
 
02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what we were seeing
 
02:09:11.870 --> 02:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
in Newfound the phosphorus loading the
 
02:09:13.609 --> 02:09:13.619 align:start position:0%
phosphorus is the primary nutrient in
 
02:09:14.629 --> 02:09:14.639 align:start position:0%
fresh water
 
02:09:17.689 --> 02:09:17.699 align:start position:0%
who was not changing a lot even with
 
02:09:19.910 --> 02:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
land use changes in development maybe a
 
02:09:22.010 --> 02:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
little bit but not a lot but the
 
02:09:25.070 --> 02:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
temperature was going up I mean we saw
 
02:09:27.050 --> 02:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
oh it used to be you'd never see
 
02:09:28.910 --> 02:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
temperature a water temperature of 80
 
02:09:30.830 --> 02:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
degrees and by the time I'd left three
 
02:09:32.810 --> 02:09:32.820 align:start position:0%
years ago we were seeing it we'd seen it
 
02:09:34.070 --> 02:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
for three or four years in a row or
 
02:09:35.810 --> 02:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
three years out of five and that's
 
02:09:39.050 --> 02:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
that's the trigger so a program like
 
02:09:41.390 --> 02:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
this really has to build in resilience
 
02:09:43.550 --> 02:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if I'm too close it really has
 
02:09:46.010 --> 02:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
to build in ecological resilience at the
 
02:09:48.709 --> 02:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
Watershed scale to provide protection
 
02:09:51.310 --> 02:09:51.320 align:start position:0%
against you know climate change
 
02:09:53.290 --> 02:09:53.300 align:start position:0%
development growth
 
02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
basically land use that is pretty much
 
02:09:58.129 --> 02:09:58.139 align:start position:0%
the status quo for us so it's a it's a
 
02:09:59.870 --> 02:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
bit of a push it's a it's a big
 
02:10:01.370 --> 02:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
Communications push there's science
 
02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
behind it there's there's politics
 
02:10:06.890 --> 02:10:06.900 align:start position:0%
behind it this Communications behind it
 
02:10:09.530 --> 02:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
and I think this I think these funds and
 
02:10:11.390 --> 02:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
I agree most Lake Associations can't
 
02:10:13.850 --> 02:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
afford them from a water drinking water
 
02:10:16.129 --> 02:10:16.139 align:start position:0%
source you can always talk to your town
 
02:10:18.109 --> 02:10:18.119 align:start position:0%
and you know deal with rates or a
 
02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
capital bond issue or something like
 
02:10:22.669 --> 02:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
that but we were a non-profit and bigger
 
02:10:24.589 --> 02:10:24.599 align:start position:0%
than the guys you've heard before me but
 
02:10:27.169 --> 02:10:27.179 align:start position:0%
uh we got almost a half a million
 
02:10:29.089 --> 02:10:29.099 align:start position:0%
dollars in federal funding over a
 
02:10:30.890 --> 02:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
10-year period that then we met
 
02:10:33.709 --> 02:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
essentially matched with our labor and
 
02:10:36.290 --> 02:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
our time so it was a million dollar
 
02:10:39.709 --> 02:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
project over about a part of 10 years
 
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much

thank you representative

thank you representative
um

02:10:52.669 --> 02:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:54.950 --> 02:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh Mr deers is talking about the large
 
02:10:56.750 --> 02:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
amounts of federal funding for drinking
 
02:10:59.209 --> 02:10:59.219 align:start position:0%
water grants and you had mentioned about
 
02:11:03.290 --> 02:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
the source protection Source Waters to
 
02:11:06.109 --> 02:11:06.119 align:start position:0%
the grants do you know
 
02:11:07.669 --> 02:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
um can they be applied to the source
 
02:11:10.910 --> 02:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
Waters or that's a great question I
 
02:11:12.770 --> 02:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
don't have the answer to that I'd be
 
02:11:14.270 --> 02:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
happy to dig into it and try and find
 
02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599 align:start position:0%
that out and get back to you it might
 
02:11:17.450 --> 02:11:17.460 align:start position:0%
take me a couple three days if that's
 
02:11:17.460 --> 02:11:18.410 align:start position:0%
take me a couple three days if that's
okay

02:11:18.410 --> 02:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:11:23.510 --> 02:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions Mr wool
 
02:11:29.810 --> 02:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:32.750 --> 02:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question one
 
02:11:35.390 --> 02:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
of my concerns is I am up in the town of
 
02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
Newbury representing Newbury and New
 
02:11:40.250 --> 02:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
London and we've been trying to get our
 
02:11:42.709 --> 02:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
three towns although they work well
 
02:11:44.750 --> 02:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
together on a tax assessor they have a
 
02:11:47.450 --> 02:11:47.460 align:start position:0%
joint tax assessor for three towns but
 
02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
do uh can't seem to get three towns to
 
02:11:53.689 --> 02:11:53.699 align:start position:0%
work together to come up with a
 
02:11:55.550 --> 02:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
Environmental Management plan that
 
02:11:57.050 --> 02:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
affects the lake
 
02:11:59.689 --> 02:11:59.699 align:start position:0%
and the other lakes in there and my
 
02:12:03.370 --> 02:12:03.380 align:start position:0%
concern on this is how do you get
 
02:12:06.350 --> 02:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
two reading which I was surprised it's
 
02:12:09.470 --> 02:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
only 20 percent but the 20 of the
 
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
problem that comes from septic systems
 
02:12:18.229 --> 02:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
how do you somehow get those people who
 
02:12:21.470 --> 02:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
are there just to inspect their system
 
02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:22.970 align:start position:0%
are there just to inspect their system
Etc

02:12:22.970 --> 02:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
02:12:25.609 --> 02:12:25.619 align:start position:0%
yeah I you know I I came to the
 
02:12:28.010 --> 02:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
conclusion that the um the critical
 
02:12:30.950 --> 02:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
factor is political will
 
02:12:32.450 --> 02:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
um the money helps I mean if you don't
 
02:12:34.010 --> 02:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
have the money to do a study it's
 
02:12:35.750 --> 02:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
probably not going to get done but once
 
02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
you get the study done
 
02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
um fact facts don't change people's
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
minds they've got to be feelings and
 
02:12:43.199 --> 02:12:45.410 align:start position:0%
minds they've got to be feelings and
ultimately

02:12:45.410 --> 02:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
02:12:47.450 --> 02:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
you know there may be regulatory stuff
 
02:12:49.010 --> 02:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
there I'm not that familiar I thought
 
02:12:50.450 --> 02:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
you had to do some sort of an inspection
 
02:12:53.330 --> 02:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
when your property changed hands but I
 
02:12:54.709 --> 02:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
would certainly think at the local level
 
02:12:57.350 --> 02:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
an ordinance could be put in place to to
 
02:13:00.649 --> 02:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
inspect your septic system but that
 
02:13:02.569 --> 02:13:02.579 align:start position:0%
really isn't my bailiwick I know the
 
02:13:04.850 --> 02:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
state's got a you know got a department
 
02:13:08.270 --> 02:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
that looks at septics and um but it's
 
02:13:10.330 --> 02:13:10.340 align:start position:0%
getting the three towns to work together
 
02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
you got to realize you know it and it's
 
02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
an uphill push you know this is this is
 
02:13:18.290 --> 02:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
our Golden Goose you know that's laying
 
02:13:20.030 --> 02:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
the golden egg year after year and if we
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
don't take care of it what you know what
 
02:13:23.629 --> 02:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
are we not doing it's and people haven't
 
02:13:25.069 --> 02:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
had to take care of it stuff's
 
02:13:27.589 --> 02:13:27.599 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Lakes New Hampshire Lakes is a
 
02:14:19.850 --> 02:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
Statewide non-profit organization our
 
02:14:22.910 --> 02:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
mission is to restore and preserve the
 
02:14:25.450 --> 02:14:25.460 align:start position:0%
health of our lakes in New Hampshire
 
02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
we represent about 2 000 individual
 
02:14:31.550 --> 02:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
supporters and about a hundred local
 
02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
Lake Associations and those local Lake
 
02:14:36.229 --> 02:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
Associations each have some of them
 
02:14:39.189 --> 02:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
hundreds of members I know you've heard
 
02:14:42.169 --> 02:14:42.179 align:start position:0%
from many of our supporters and many of
 
02:14:45.050 --> 02:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
our Lake Association Partners over their
 
02:14:47.870 --> 02:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
email the past couple days and many are
 
02:14:50.750 --> 02:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
sitting in this room today
 
02:14:54.109 --> 02:14:54.119 align:start position:0%
um I'm also a lake resident and a lake
 
02:14:56.930 --> 02:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
user my family has a home on like
 
02:14:58.810 --> 02:14:58.820 align:start position:0%
Sunapee which has experience
 
02:15:01.790 --> 02:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria my husband's family has a
 
02:15:04.609 --> 02:15:04.619 align:start position:0%
home on Seneca Lake in New York the
 
02:15:06.250 --> 02:15:06.260 align:start position:0%
biggest finger Lake and it's been
 
02:15:09.290 --> 02:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
experiencing horrendous cyanobacteria
 
02:15:12.530 --> 02:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
blooms so I have personal experience I
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
know what a toxic cyanobacteria Bloom
 
02:15:17.810 --> 02:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
can do to a lake to a family and a
 
02:15:20.450 --> 02:15:20.460 align:start position:0%
community I have had to keep my kid out
 
02:15:22.669 --> 02:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
of the water my niece and nieces and
 
02:15:25.910 --> 02:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
nephews out of the water my dog
 
02:15:27.770 --> 02:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
um my mother-in-law got sick from a
 
02:15:30.649 --> 02:15:30.659 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria bloom so first-hand
 
02:15:30.659 --> 02:15:32.089 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria bloom so first-hand
experience

02:15:32.089 --> 02:15:32.099 align:start position:0%
experience
 
02:15:34.790 --> 02:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
but this morning I just really briefly
 
02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to share with you two very quick
 
02:15:40.069 --> 02:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
thing two things that I think this Loan
 
02:15:43.550 --> 02:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
Fund could do um you've already heard
 
02:15:45.470 --> 02:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
um this so I'll just sort of add on to
 
02:15:48.770 --> 02:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
it but first our local communities Our
 
02:15:50.270 --> 02:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
Lake Associations and their
 
02:15:53.330 --> 02:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
municipalities generally they have a
 
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
pretty good idea of what's contributing
 
02:15:58.609 --> 02:15:58.619 align:start position:0%
pollution to their lakes that is causing
 
02:16:02.689 --> 02:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
these blooms there are there is some
 
02:16:04.850 --> 02:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
financial assistance there are grants
 
02:16:06.589 --> 02:16:06.599 align:start position:0%
we've talked about this there's Federal
 
02:16:09.410 --> 02:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
funding available to Lake Associations
 
02:16:12.050 --> 02:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
and municipalities with an approved
 
02:16:15.470 --> 02:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
management plan to start pecking away at
 
02:16:17.810 --> 02:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
these sources of pollution but the
 
02:16:20.209 --> 02:16:20.219 align:start position:0%
funding is limited and it's given out
 
02:16:22.609 --> 02:16:22.619 align:start position:0%
you know small chunks over a long period
 
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
of time it could take a look like
 
02:16:27.589 --> 02:16:27.599 align:start position:0%
Association Newfound I'm on the board of
 
02:16:29.870 --> 02:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
Newfound Region Lake Association and we
 
02:16:32.509 --> 02:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
have a very long plan you know a 10 your
 
02:16:35.089 --> 02:16:35.099 align:start position:0%
plan of implementing these projects that
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
are going to stop the pollution so we
 
02:16:39.290 --> 02:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
know today what the problems are but
 
02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to address it
 
02:16:43.370 --> 02:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
all for 10 years and I'd like to suggest
 
02:16:45.410 --> 02:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
that we don't have that time here to
 
02:16:49.129 --> 02:16:49.139 align:start position:0%
wait this is happening now this Loan
 
02:16:51.830 --> 02:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
Fund could help provide substantial
 
02:16:54.770 --> 02:16:54.780 align:start position:0%
resources to get these sources of
 
02:16:58.129 --> 02:16:58.139 align:start position:0%
pollution addressed in a relatively you
 
02:17:00.830 --> 02:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
know quick or quicker time frame
 
02:17:03.230 --> 02:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
the second point I wanted to make and
 
02:17:06.169 --> 02:17:06.179 align:start position:0%
it's been brought up is with some
 
02:17:08.270 --> 02:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
creative thinking I believe that this
 
02:17:10.849 --> 02:17:10.859 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund could provide incentives and
 
02:17:14.209 --> 02:17:14.219 align:start position:0%
Empower residents to upgrade repair
 
02:17:17.870 --> 02:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
replace failing septic systems of Ted
 
02:17:20.270 --> 02:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
and Norm mentioned that New Hampshire
 
02:17:22.429 --> 02:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
Lakes runs the lake smart Lake friendly
 
02:17:25.190 --> 02:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
Living Program through this free
 
02:17:28.549 --> 02:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
voluntary program my team in the past
 
02:17:31.370 --> 02:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
just two years we've met with 700
 
02:17:33.169 --> 02:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
different Property Owners at their
 
02:17:36.410 --> 02:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
properties in at 130 different Lake
 
02:17:36.420 --> 02:17:37.610 align:start position:0%
properties in at 130 different Lake
communities

02:17:37.610 --> 02:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:17:39.830 --> 02:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
and basically come up with a customized
 
02:17:41.870 --> 02:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
plan which each of these homeowners
 
02:17:44.089 --> 02:17:44.099 align:start position:0%
Property Owners things that they could
 
02:17:46.849 --> 02:17:46.859 align:start position:0%
do to reduce the amount of pollution
 
02:17:48.889 --> 02:17:48.899 align:start position:0%
that their property and their activities
 
02:17:50.810 --> 02:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
contributes to the lake and potentially
 
02:17:54.230 --> 02:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
to toxic cyanobacterial blooms many
 
02:17:56.929 --> 02:17:56.939 align:start position:0%
property owners have implemented
 
02:17:58.429 --> 02:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
um improvements like friendly living
 
02:18:00.530 --> 02:18:00.540 align:start position:0%
improvements a landscaping projects
 
02:18:03.169 --> 02:18:03.179 align:start position:0%
roadway projects stuff like that on
 
02:18:05.690 --> 02:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
their own on their own dime
 
02:18:09.049 --> 02:18:09.059 align:start position:0%
we have through this program uh you know
 
02:18:11.990 --> 02:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
had the displeasure unfortunate pleasure
 
02:18:13.730 --> 02:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
of letting some Property Owners know
 
02:18:16.370 --> 02:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
that their septic system is is not doing
 
02:18:20.150 --> 02:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
well is not up to Snuff we don't have in
 
02:18:22.310 --> 02:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for various reasons uh
 
02:18:25.129 --> 02:18:25.139 align:start position:0%
reliable numbers of troublesome systems
 
02:18:27.349 --> 02:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
throughout the state Troublesome septic
 
02:18:30.049 --> 02:18:30.059 align:start position:0%
systems nor do we really provide
 
02:18:32.150 --> 02:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
incentives on the Statewide level to
 
02:18:34.910 --> 02:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
help people find that out and then do
 
02:18:37.669 --> 02:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
something about it so through this Lake
 
02:18:39.469 --> 02:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
smart Lake friendly Living Program we
 
02:18:42.889 --> 02:18:42.899 align:start position:0%
have asked Property Owners you know yes
 
02:18:45.290 --> 02:18:45.300 align:start position:0%
replacing a septic system can be a
 
02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
financial burden you know I think
 
02:18:49.009 --> 02:18:49.019 align:start position:0%
there's a misconception sometimes that a
 
02:18:50.629 --> 02:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
lakefront property owner you know has
 
02:18:52.669 --> 02:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
the money and the resources to repair a
 
02:18:55.009 --> 02:18:55.019 align:start position:0%
septic system that is not always the
 
02:18:55.019 --> 02:18:56.990 align:start position:0%
septic system that is not always the
case

02:18:56.990 --> 02:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:19:00.049 --> 02:19:00.059 align:start position:0%
um and so I've asked these folks if
 
02:19:01.610 --> 02:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
there was some sort of program in your
 
02:19:03.169 --> 02:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
community implemented by the Lake
 
02:19:05.089 --> 02:19:05.099 align:start position:0%
Association or the municipality and
 
02:19:07.490 --> 02:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
there are examples of this
 
02:19:10.009 --> 02:19:10.019 align:start position:0%
um that you were provided some financial
 
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
assistance to repair the system you know
 
02:19:15.230 --> 02:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
would this help and the answer is yes
 
02:19:17.690 --> 02:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
again we have no idea the number of
 
02:19:19.730 --> 02:19:19.740 align:start position:0%
troublesome systems around our Lakes but
 
02:19:22.669 --> 02:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
local Lake Associations some in this
 
02:19:25.790 --> 02:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
room have done really good surveys of
 
02:19:28.150 --> 02:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
their Watershed and have found
 
02:19:31.730 --> 02:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
several systems you know within 250 feet
 
02:19:34.190 --> 02:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
of the lake that are older than um you
 
02:19:36.770 --> 02:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
know 1967 when the permitting process
 
02:19:40.429 --> 02:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
went in to a fact in New Hampshire so I
 
02:19:41.870 --> 02:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
really do think this is an opportunity
 
02:19:43.910 --> 02:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
if we think creatively to provide some
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
incentives and in New Hampshire finally
 
02:19:49.969 --> 02:19:49.979 align:start position:0%
to help folks upgrade these systems
 
02:19:53.150 --> 02:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
so with that I just want to urge you to
 
02:19:55.130 --> 02:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
vote like your Lakes depend on it with
 
02:19:57.650 --> 02:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
this because they do you know Lakes
 
02:20:00.170 --> 02:20:00.180 align:start position:0%
clean and healthy Lakes are an urgent
 
02:20:02.570 --> 02:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
threat under urgent
 
02:20:04.730 --> 02:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
threats here and and it's time we do
 
02:20:06.170 --> 02:20:06.180 align:start position:0%
something so happy to answer any
 
02:20:06.180 --> 02:20:07.429 align:start position:0%
something so happy to answer any
questions

02:20:07.429 --> 02:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:20:11.389 --> 02:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:13.670 --> 02:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey polio
 
02:20:16.370 --> 02:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Harbin thank
 
02:20:18.410 --> 02:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony
 
02:20:22.010 --> 02:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
um I was just wondering if you knew how
 
02:20:24.710 --> 02:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
this the funds from this bill might be
 
02:20:27.050 --> 02:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
used to address one of the issues that
 
02:20:29.030 --> 02:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
was brought up by another speaker which
 
02:20:33.230 --> 02:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
was to a homeowner moves in and puts in
 
02:20:36.410 --> 02:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
a lawn and which produces a lot of
 
02:20:36.420 --> 02:20:37.849 align:start position:0%
a lawn and which produces a lot of
phosphorus

02:20:37.849 --> 02:20:37.859 align:start position:0%
phosphorus
 
02:20:39.950 --> 02:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
how would you keep such a thing from
 
02:20:39.960 --> 02:20:41.030 align:start position:0%
how would you keep such a thing from
happening

02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
happening
 
02:20:43.610 --> 02:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
possibly through this uh the use of this
 
02:20:46.370 --> 02:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
bill yeah that's a good question and I
 
02:20:48.530 --> 02:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
think um this bill again if we think
 
02:20:50.710 --> 02:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
creatively could present opportunities
 
02:20:53.690 --> 02:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
for local communities associations
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities to provide cost share
 
02:20:59.750 --> 02:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
grants or cost share opportunities for
 
02:21:03.590 --> 02:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
folks to upgrade their properties to
 
02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
make them more like friendly so that
 
02:21:06.650 --> 02:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
property owner
 
02:21:08.750 --> 02:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe needs to
 
02:21:11.150 --> 02:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
maybe if they had an opportunity to make
 
02:21:12.950 --> 02:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
their property more like friendly by
 
02:21:15.710 --> 02:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
establishing you know vegetative buffer
 
02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
on the other side of their lawn you know
 
02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
maybe they'd be more apt to do that I
 
02:21:21.650 --> 02:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
don't know if I'm exactly answering your
 
02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
question but I do think there's an
 
02:21:25.429 --> 02:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity here to
 
02:21:25.439 --> 02:21:27.010 align:start position:0%
opportunity here to
um

02:21:27.010 --> 02:21:27.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
incentivize and financially assist
 
02:21:31.790 --> 02:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
Property Owners to live in a more
 
02:21:35.809 --> 02:21:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:38.990 --> 02:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:40.790 --> 02:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:21:46.490 --> 02:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:48.650 --> 02:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
our next speaker is uh Mr Brian
 
02:21:57.969 --> 02:21:57.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:00.950 --> 02:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
Brian just a question is Abigail Adams
 
02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
with you because you happen to be on the
 
02:22:05.150 --> 02:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
same street in the same town she is who
 
02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
would she like to come up with you we
 
02:22:10.130 --> 02:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
can do both of you at one time
 
02:22:13.130 --> 02:22:13.140 align:start position:0%
in fact uh thank you for the opportunity
 
02:22:16.730 --> 02:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
to speak I will be very brief uh I'm
 
02:22:19.010 --> 02:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
from Wolf bro I've been there since the
 
02:22:22.929 --> 02:22:22.939 align:start position:0%
late 50s and uh I just wanted to present
 
02:22:27.490 --> 02:22:27.500 align:start position:0%
one fairly concerning economic fact
 
02:22:30.770 --> 02:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
let's take a lesson from Vermont a
 
02:22:33.770 --> 02:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth study showed that property
 
02:22:36.290 --> 02:22:36.300 align:start position:0%
values along Lake Champlain have fallen
 
02:22:39.490 --> 02:22:39.500 align:start position:0%
30 percent because of cyanobacter
 
02:22:43.070 --> 02:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
bacteria blooms and so this is a real
 
02:22:45.650 --> 02:22:45.660 align:start position:0%
issue that we have to tackle and I'll
 
02:22:47.990 --> 02:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
turn things over to my wife
 
02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
I'm my name is Abby I always said the
 
02:22:51.950 --> 02:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
last word
 
02:22:51.960 --> 02:22:53.690 align:start position:0%
last word
um

02:22:53.690 --> 02:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:56.090 --> 02:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
I couldn't resist my name is Abigail
 
02:22:58.490 --> 02:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
Adams and I also live in Wolfeboro and
 
02:23:00.590 --> 02:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
I'm a member of the Town committee
 
02:23:02.750 --> 02:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
Wolfeboro Waters which is a committee of
 
02:23:06.550 --> 02:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
volunteers appointed by the selectman to
 
02:23:09.530 --> 02:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
advocate for water quality of our lakes
 
02:23:12.170 --> 02:23:12.180 align:start position:0%
and ponds in Wolfeboro and I won't I'll
 
02:23:14.929 --> 02:23:14.939 align:start position:0%
be very brief I think that two things
 
02:23:16.270 --> 02:23:16.280 align:start position:0%
are true
 
02:23:18.590 --> 02:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
nutrients such as phosphorus and
 
02:23:22.150 --> 02:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
nitrogen are like candy to cyanobacteria
 
02:23:26.150 --> 02:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
and that 80 percent of these nutrients
 
02:23:28.250 --> 02:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
come from storm water runoff
 
02:23:31.790 --> 02:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
usually from imperfectly developed land
 
02:23:33.830 --> 02:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
that then allows water to run down
 
02:23:36.050 --> 02:23:36.060 align:start position:0%
ashore into a water body or into a
 
02:23:38.210 --> 02:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
culvert that reaches a water body
 
02:23:40.610 --> 02:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
or roads and they don't have to be dirt
 
02:23:43.610 --> 02:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
roads although they're particularly bad
 
02:23:45.349 --> 02:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
02:23:47.210 --> 02:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
you know from personal reasons having
 
02:23:49.250 --> 02:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
enjoyed being swimming in Lake
 
02:23:52.030 --> 02:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee for the last 40 plus years
 
02:23:55.610 --> 02:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
I hate to see this happening but also
 
02:23:58.030 --> 02:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
just from an economic point of view
 
02:24:01.670 --> 02:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
these are the jewels in our crown and in
 
02:24:04.130 --> 02:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
the in the state of New Hampshire and
 
02:24:05.349 --> 02:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
they are
 
02:24:08.510 --> 02:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
essential to keeping our property values
 
02:24:10.370 --> 02:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
and our tax base so I think I would
 
02:24:12.050 --> 02:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
really urge you to think carefully about
 
02:24:14.690 --> 02:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
funding anything you can do to decrease
 
02:24:17.230 --> 02:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
the amount of
 
02:24:19.969 --> 02:24:19.979 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria outbreaks thank you for
 
02:24:22.429 --> 02:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
letting me speak thank you any questions
 
02:24:26.710 --> 02:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:28.670 --> 02:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question just very
 
02:24:31.250 --> 02:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
briefly can you maybe forward that study
 
02:24:34.490 --> 02:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
reference sure thank you
 
02:24:37.070 --> 02:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:24:43.250 --> 02:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:46.790 --> 02:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
next speaker Brie Rossiter Lake
 
02:25:17.270 --> 02:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:19.250 --> 02:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and members of the
 
02:25:21.290 --> 02:25:21.300 align:start position:0%

Association
 
02:25:28.010 --> 02:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
we are the leading organization
 
02:25:30.050 --> 02:25:30.060 align:start position:0%
dedicated to protecting the water
 
02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
quality and natural resources of Lake
 
02:25:33.650 --> 02:25:33.660 align:start position:0%

Generations

02:25:36.050 --> 02:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
Generations
 
02:25:38.690 --> 02:25:38.700 align:start position:0%
Lake Winnipesaukee is a key economic and
 
02:25:40.610 --> 02:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
recreational driver for the Lakes region
 
02:25:43.790 --> 02:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
in 2021 the center of public policy at
 
02:25:45.650 --> 02:25:45.660 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth College completed a policy
 
02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
brief that estimated the economic value
 
02:25:50.750 --> 02:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
of Lake Winnipesaukee at 17 billion
 
02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:52.550 align:start position:0%
of Lake Winnipesaukee at 17 billion
dollars

02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:25:54.410 --> 02:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
the largest contributor to this
 
02:25:56.870 --> 02:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
valuation was property values which are
 
02:25:59.270 --> 02:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
estimated at 16 billion dollars
 
02:26:03.290 --> 02:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
and 445 million of that consist of
 
02:26:05.330 --> 02:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
recreational opportunities which depend
 
02:26:07.610 --> 02:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
on a clean and healthy Lake
 
02:26:09.590 --> 02:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
over the last several years we have seen
 
02:26:11.570 --> 02:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
an increase in cyanobacteria blooms on
 
02:26:13.250 --> 02:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
Lake Winnipesaukee
 
02:26:16.429 --> 02:26:16.439 align:start position:0%
in 2018 the first cyanobacteria advisory
 
02:26:19.270 --> 02:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
was issued in Des on Winnie
 
02:26:22.429 --> 02:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
and no advisories were issued from 2019
 
02:26:26.570 --> 02:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
to 2021 but in 2022 there were four
 
02:26:30.050 --> 02:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
advisories three alerts and 18 confirmed
 
02:26:30.060 --> 02:26:32.389 align:start position:0%
advisories three alerts and 18 confirmed
observations

02:26:32.389 --> 02:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
observations
 
02:26:34.370 --> 02:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
for the last 12 years we've been working
 
02:26:35.929 --> 02:26:35.939 align:start position:0%
to address and reduce polluted
 
02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
stormwater runoff through the
 
02:26:38.570 --> 02:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
development of our watershed management
 
02:26:41.090 --> 02:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
plans so as part of these plans we've
 
02:26:43.849 --> 02:26:43.859 align:start position:0%
actually identified over 270 sites that
 
02:26:46.550 --> 02:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
are in need of mitigation
 
02:26:48.950 --> 02:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
to date we've been able to complete 50
 
02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
projects at a cost of 1.2 million
 
02:26:55.250 --> 02:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
dollars so these projects have resulted
 
02:26:57.889 --> 02:26:57.899 align:start position:0%
in a reduction of approximately 85
 
02:26:59.830 --> 02:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
pounds of
 
02:27:02.889 --> 02:27:02.899 align:start position:0%
phosphorus entering the lake per year
 
02:27:08.349 --> 02:27:08.359 align:start position:0%
157 pounds of nitrogen and 137
 
02:27:11.750 --> 02:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
774 pounds of sediment
 
02:27:14.150 --> 02:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
this is really significant because one
 
02:27:16.190 --> 02:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
pound of phosphorus can support 500
 
02:27:18.830 --> 02:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
pounds of algae growth therefore by
 
02:27:20.929 --> 02:27:20.939 align:start position:0%
implementing these mitigation projects
 
02:27:23.150 --> 02:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
the potential algal and cyanobacteria
 
02:27:26.570 --> 02:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
growth has been reduced by 42 500 pounds
 
02:27:28.550 --> 02:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
in Lake Winnipesaukee
 
02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
overall I'd like to say that restoration
 
02:27:33.830 --> 02:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
is expensive and as of you've heard from
 
02:27:36.170 --> 02:27:36.180 align:start position:0%
everybody else funding is really
 
02:27:38.510 --> 02:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
competitive so a loan program would
 
02:27:40.309 --> 02:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
provide desperately needed funding to
 
02:27:41.809 --> 02:27:41.819 align:start position:0%
increase the number and speed at which
 
02:27:43.610 --> 02:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
these projects are accomplished
 
02:27:46.130 --> 02:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
supporting House Bill 276 is very
 
02:27:48.290 --> 02:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
important to ensure the continuation of
 
02:27:49.849 --> 02:27:49.859 align:start position:0%
the economic Vitality in The Lakes
 
02:27:49.859 --> 02:27:50.929 align:start position:0%
the economic Vitality in The Lakes
Region

02:27:50.929 --> 02:27:50.939 align:start position:0%
Region
 
02:27:52.130 --> 02:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:27:56.770 --> 02:27:56.780 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from Mr Rossiter
 
02:27:58.969 --> 02:27:58.979 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:28:04.849 --> 02:28:04.859 align:start position:0%

uh I am Fred Quimby I'm a resident of

New Durham New Hampshire
 
02:28:32.750 --> 02:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
and I am the chairman of the new Durham

water quality committee
 
02:28:36.469 --> 02:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
and it's from that perspective that I'm
 
02:28:40.610 --> 02:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:42.650 --> 02:28:42.660 align:start position:0%
New Durham is a little town in New
 
02:28:42.660 --> 02:28:43.969 align:start position:0%
New Durham is a little town in New
Hampshire

02:28:43.969 --> 02:28:43.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:28:48.710 --> 02:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
it has about 2 000 residences
 
02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:49.490 align:start position:0%
it has about 2 000 residences
um

02:28:49.490 --> 02:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:51.410 --> 02:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
it has no centralized wastewater
 
02:28:54.230 --> 02:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
treatment facility it has no centralized
 
02:28:56.990 --> 02:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
what a distribution facility so
 
02:28:58.370 --> 02:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
everybody in the town pretty much
 
02:28:59.990 --> 02:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
depends on having their own well and
 
02:29:02.570 --> 02:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
their own septic system
 
02:29:06.050 --> 02:29:06.060 align:start position:0%
who Durham also has nine lakes and ponds
 
02:29:08.389 --> 02:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
with sixteen hundred and forty Acres of
 
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
surface water as well as 84 miles of
 
02:29:15.290 --> 02:29:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:18.170 --> 02:29:18.180 align:start position:0%
now while locating a well
 
02:29:21.050 --> 02:29:21.060 align:start position:0%
an aseptic system on a conforming lot
 
02:29:24.590 --> 02:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
which a new Durham is 1.5 acres is not a
 
02:29:25.790 --> 02:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
big deal
 
02:29:29.030 --> 02:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately for the nearly one
 
02:29:30.950 --> 02:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
half of all the residences that are
 
02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
located within the shore land of those
 
02:29:35.150 --> 02:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
water bodies
 
02:29:36.770 --> 02:29:36.780 align:start position:0%
most of those properties are
 
02:29:39.650 --> 02:29:39.660 align:start position:0%
non-conforming some as small as an
 
02:29:42.110 --> 02:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
eighth of an acre
 
02:29:44.030 --> 02:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
when you have an eighth of an acre of
 
02:29:46.610 --> 02:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
land it doesn't allow you to even put in
 
02:29:49.250 --> 02:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
a legal size leach field
 
02:29:51.110 --> 02:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
and that's the problem I want to address
 
02:29:51.120 --> 02:29:57.469 align:start position:0%
and that's the problem I want to address
today

02:29:57.469 --> 02:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:59.750 --> 02:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
the largest lake we have in New Durham
 
02:30:01.969 --> 02:30:01.979 align:start position:0%
is Mayor meeting like with the 1100
 
02:30:01.979 --> 02:30:03.469 align:start position:0%
is Mayor meeting like with the 1100
Acres

02:30:03.469 --> 02:30:03.479 align:start position:0%
Acres
 
02:30:05.450 --> 02:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
it's one of the cleanest water bodies in
 
02:30:07.429 --> 02:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire it has an
 
02:30:11.410 --> 02:30:11.420 align:start position:0%
average phosphorus concentration of 4.5
 
02:30:14.150 --> 02:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
pots per billion
 
02:30:16.969 --> 02:30:16.979 align:start position:0%
that's really low
 
02:30:19.010 --> 02:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
and despite the fact that our watershed
 
02:30:21.889 --> 02:30:21.899 align:start position:0%
management planners had warned us
 
02:30:24.410 --> 02:30:24.420 align:start position:0%
that Septic Systems Failing would be a
 
02:30:24.420 --> 02:30:26.870 align:start position:0%
that Septic Systems Failing would be a
tremendous

02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
tremendous
 
02:30:29.809 --> 02:30:29.819 align:start position:0%
make a tremendous impact on our Lake
 
02:30:32.809 --> 02:30:32.819 align:start position:0%
we had not seen any cyanobacteria blooms
 
02:30:34.790 --> 02:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
until two years ago
 
02:30:37.570 --> 02:30:37.580 align:start position:0%
in 2021 we had two transient
 
02:30:41.870 --> 02:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
cyanobacterial blooms again in 2022 we
 
02:30:45.590 --> 02:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
had two cyanobacterial blooms
 
02:30:49.250 --> 02:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
in the oldest part of the lake many of
 
02:30:52.010 --> 02:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
the homes were built in the 1920s
 
02:30:54.530 --> 02:30:54.540 align:start position:0%
that also happens to be with the lots
 
02:30:56.330 --> 02:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
are the smallest
 
02:30:58.849 --> 02:30:58.859 align:start position:0%
it also happens to be a place where some
 
02:31:01.010 --> 02:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
people just have holding tanks they
 
02:31:03.770 --> 02:31:03.780 align:start position:0%
can't locate a septic system
 
02:31:05.929 --> 02:31:05.939 align:start position:0%
so our community has begun to look into
 
02:31:08.150 --> 02:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
purchasing a common piece of land away
 
02:31:11.090 --> 02:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
from the Waterfront and putting in a
 
02:31:13.610 --> 02:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
community leach field system to take
 
02:31:15.410 --> 02:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
care of those people with the old
 
02:31:18.590 --> 02:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:20.510 --> 02:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
the bill that has been proposed here
 
02:31:23.450 --> 02:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
would really help our municipality with
 
02:31:25.130 --> 02:31:25.140 align:start position:0%
a long-term loan
 
02:31:27.410 --> 02:31:27.420 align:start position:0%
and allow us to be able to fund such a
 
02:31:31.250 --> 02:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:33.050 --> 02:31:33.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any

02:31:38.280 --> 02:31:40.910 align:start position:0%
seeing none again thank you for your

the Wentworth Watershed Association has
 
02:32:17.210 --> 02:32:17.220 align:start position:0%
been in existence in some portion for
 
02:32:19.610 --> 02:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
almost over a hundred years we've been
 
02:32:21.170 --> 02:32:21.180 align:start position:0%
monitoring the Waters of the seventh
 
02:32:22.610 --> 02:32:22.620 align:start position:0%

we work collaboratively with a town
 
02:32:31.790 --> 02:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
to address Watershed issues do education
 
02:32:34.429 --> 02:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
and Outreach and are a strong voice in
 
02:32:35.990 --> 02:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
the community to lead people in the
 
02:32:37.550 --> 02:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
right direction including our membership
 
02:32:40.910 --> 02:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
which is over 800 residents many of
 
02:32:42.830 --> 02:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
which are shorefront Property Owners but
 
02:32:46.190 --> 02:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
also residents who are in the actual
 
02:32:49.490 --> 02:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
Watershed week by land we can serve land
 
02:32:52.270 --> 02:32:52.280 align:start position:0%
we install infiltration
 
02:32:55.910 --> 02:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
Trend infiltration bmps through the
 
02:32:57.590 --> 02:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
watershed management assistance grants
 
02:33:00.290 --> 02:33:00.300 align:start position:0%
or the 319 grants we have a watershed
 
02:33:02.389 --> 02:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
management plan that we put into effect
 
02:33:05.809 --> 02:33:05.819 align:start position:0%
in 2012 and we are actually redoing our
 
02:33:07.309 --> 02:33:07.319 align:start position:0%
watershed management plan at this point
 
02:33:09.590 --> 02:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
because we have addressed the top 20
 
02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
issues so we are tapping into all
 
02:33:15.410 --> 02:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
available funds for cyanobacteria
 
02:33:17.389 --> 02:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
monitoring for technology we're working
 
02:33:19.370 --> 02:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
with our municipality we're working with
 
02:33:24.290 --> 02:33:24.300 align:start position:0%
des and EPA to address these issues and
 
02:33:27.290 --> 02:33:27.300 align:start position:0%
what is very clear is cyanobacteria is
 
02:33:29.330 --> 02:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
becoming a prevalent issue in the state
 
02:33:31.550 --> 02:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
for all water bodies big and small
 
02:33:34.309 --> 02:33:34.319 align:start position:0%
shallow and deep and the funding that's
 
02:33:36.770 --> 02:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
available to protect the state waters is
 
02:33:39.349 --> 02:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
very limited and now that cyanobacteria
 
02:33:41.990 --> 02:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
has become this um
 
02:33:44.389 --> 02:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
the canary and the coal mine a lot of
 
02:33:47.210 --> 02:33:47.220 align:start position:0%
other organizations are tapping into the
 
02:33:49.550 --> 02:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
funds which is amazing so the Watershed
 
02:33:52.190 --> 02:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
assistant Grant funds through the EPA is
 
02:33:54.710 --> 02:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
very limited annually and this year for
 
02:33:57.290 --> 02:33:57.300 align:start position:0%
the first year ever we did not receive
 
02:34:00.349 --> 02:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
our 319 Grant because they allocated the
 
02:34:02.510 --> 02:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
funds to more to other organizations
 
02:34:04.849 --> 02:34:04.859 align:start position:0%
which is amazing for them but what it's
 
02:34:07.610 --> 02:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
doing is slowing down our hard work so
 
02:34:10.670 --> 02:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
the state needs to really look at how
 
02:34:13.969 --> 02:34:13.979 align:start position:0%
can we use taxpayer dollars to further
 
02:34:15.650 --> 02:34:15.660 align:start position:0%
support the work of these organizations
 
02:34:18.410 --> 02:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
Beyond what's already there and this
 
02:34:21.469 --> 02:34:21.479 align:start position:0%
revolving fund with 10 forgiveness is a
 
02:34:24.050 --> 02:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
good start we need funding and we need
 
02:34:27.650 --> 02:34:27.660 align:start position:0%
to do things now not wait and so even
 
02:34:29.929 --> 02:34:29.939 align:start position:0%
having a setback by one year could
 
02:34:31.490 --> 02:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
really affect the work that we're doing
 
02:34:33.830 --> 02:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
in the effectiveness of it and in all
 
02:34:36.710 --> 02:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
honesty the state owns the water and all
 
02:34:39.230 --> 02:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
of these new municipalities and all of
 
02:34:41.450 --> 02:34:41.460 align:start position:0%
us organizations with non-profit dollars
 
02:34:44.330 --> 02:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
and that members are paying above and
 
02:34:46.490 --> 02:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
beyond to be members to do the work
 
02:34:49.910 --> 02:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be met by the state saying we
 
02:34:51.830 --> 02:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
care about your Waters we care about the
 
02:34:53.929 --> 02:34:53.939 align:start position:0%
economy and this is a good step in the
 
02:34:56.990 --> 02:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
right direction Recreation I know you're
 
02:34:58.969 --> 02:34:58.979 align:start position:0%
the recreation committee
 
02:35:01.490 --> 02:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
that's what brings all of the funding to
 
02:35:04.309 --> 02:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
our town all the jobs if we don't have
 
02:35:05.389 --> 02:35:05.399 align:start position:0%
our Lakes
 
02:35:08.389 --> 02:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
we don't have a healthy economy and we
 
02:35:10.130 --> 02:35:10.140 align:start position:0%
don't have a healthy community and we
 
02:35:11.990 --> 02:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
don't have healthy residents and we
 
02:35:13.730 --> 02:35:13.740 align:start position:0%
don't have younger residents walking to
 
02:35:15.650 --> 02:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
the state which our state so desperately
 
02:35:19.010 --> 02:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
needs so I urge you to step in the right
 
02:35:20.830 --> 02:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
direction and further support
 
02:35:23.090 --> 02:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria mitigation by providing
 
02:35:25.610 --> 02:35:25.620 align:start position:0%
loans to municipalities to organizations
 
02:35:27.830 --> 02:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
like my own and really look to the
 
02:35:30.349 --> 02:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
future of how we can
 
02:35:33.469 --> 02:35:33.479 align:start position:0%
um care and show the state taxpayers
 
02:35:35.389 --> 02:35:35.399 align:start position:0%
that we care about our Fresh Water
 
02:35:37.790 --> 02:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
Resources so I thank you for supporting
 
02:35:39.230 --> 02:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:35:43.190 --> 02:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:45.050 --> 02:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:35:49.250 --> 02:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:52.570 --> 02:35:52.580 align:start position:0%
our next speaker David rochefort
 
02:35:56.809 --> 02:35:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:58.190 --> 02:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
Mr Roche
 
02:36:00.469 --> 02:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning
 
02:36:02.510 --> 02:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Vice chair and members of the
 
02:36:04.250 --> 02:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
02:36:07.070 --> 02:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
I'm from the so I'm a representative in
 
02:36:08.389 --> 02:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
Littleton but I'm not here as a
 
02:36:10.250 --> 02:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
representative I'm here as a property
 
02:36:14.030 --> 02:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
owner and a member of The Partridge Lake
 
02:36:17.570 --> 02:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
Property Owners Association and uh so
 
02:36:19.330 --> 02:36:19.340 align:start position:0%
Partridge lake is a is a small Lake
 
02:36:23.210 --> 02:36:23.220 align:start position:0%
about a hundred acres in Littleton and
 
02:36:25.670 --> 02:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
we have our own story about cyanoco
 
02:36:28.610 --> 02:36:28.620 align:start position:0%
bacteria which I'm going to try to cut
 
02:36:31.010 --> 02:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
short a little bit uh because we had a
 
02:36:32.630 --> 02:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
long morning already but when I was
 
02:36:33.950 --> 02:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
driving down here this morning I was
 
02:36:35.929 --> 02:36:35.939 align:start position:0%
driving through the Notch and and going
 
02:36:38.450 --> 02:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
through the hills and and looking up I
 
02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
realized that this issue that we're
 
02:36:42.889 --> 02:36:42.899 align:start position:0%
talking about here today and it was
 
02:36:45.950 --> 02:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
brought up the Des mentioned it too this
 
02:36:48.530 --> 02:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
started 120 years ago this isn't
 
02:36:51.410 --> 02:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
something new that just popped up out of
 
02:36:54.650 --> 02:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
out of out of nowhere and it was in my
 
02:36:57.469 --> 02:36:57.479 align:start position:0%
opinion my it was first recognized by
 
02:37:00.110 --> 02:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
John Wingate weeks John Wingate weeks
 
02:37:03.469 --> 02:37:03.479 align:start position:0%
like myself as a native of Lancaster he
 
02:37:05.150 --> 02:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
went on to be a rep representative in
 
02:37:07.070 --> 02:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and went to Congress or
 
02:37:09.170 --> 02:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and what he noticed in
 
02:37:10.670 --> 02:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and in Southern New
 
02:37:12.530 --> 02:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the round of the turn of
 
02:37:14.690 --> 02:37:14.700 align:start position:0%
the century is that the Mills and the
 
02:37:17.210 --> 02:37:17.220 align:start position:0%
rivers were getting loaded with silt in
 
02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
addition to being loaded with silt there
 
02:37:21.469 --> 02:37:21.479 align:start position:0%
were uncontrolled wildfires up in the
 
02:37:23.150 --> 02:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
northern part of the state and this was
 
02:37:26.469 --> 02:37:26.479 align:start position:0%
a result of the widespread unmitigated
 
02:37:29.270 --> 02:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
deforestation my opinion what we're
 
02:37:32.750 --> 02:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
seeing today was cyanobacteria started
 
02:37:36.650 --> 02:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
with that deforestation 120 years ago
 
02:37:38.990 --> 02:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
we've talked about a lot about today
 
02:37:40.969 --> 02:37:40.979 align:start position:0%
about phosphorus so those of us who
 
02:37:42.530 --> 02:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
remember our chemistry courses
 
02:37:45.230 --> 02:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
phosphorus is a element it's a basic
 
02:37:47.389 --> 02:37:47.399 align:start position:0%
element and it's probably the original
 
02:37:49.849 --> 02:37:49.859 align:start position:0%
forever chemical right I mean it doesn't
 
02:37:52.730 --> 02:37:52.740 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go away so when all of our
 
02:37:55.210 --> 02:37:55.220 align:start position:0%
trees were cut down and all of our our
 
02:37:58.490 --> 02:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
Hills were turned into to grazing land
 
02:38:01.910 --> 02:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
all of that phosphorus from manure and
 
02:38:06.050 --> 02:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
natural deposits and and fertilizer all
 
02:38:07.910 --> 02:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
flowed downhill and in our case in
 
02:38:09.650 --> 02:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
Littleton it flowed right into Partridge
 
02:38:11.690 --> 02:38:11.700 align:start position:0%
Lake we're right at the bottom of a bowl
 
02:38:13.969 --> 02:38:13.979 align:start position:0%
we have a sheep farm or a former sheep
 
02:38:16.370 --> 02:38:16.380 align:start position:0%
farm on one end a former cattle farm on
 
02:38:19.010 --> 02:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
the other and again unlike some of the
 
02:38:22.010 --> 02:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
stories we've heard we have a I'm fairly
 
02:38:24.590 --> 02:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
new to the lake but fortunately for us
 
02:38:26.929 --> 02:38:26.939 align:start position:0%
we have some real real sharp people who
 
02:38:28.670 --> 02:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
have a lot of foresight about 30 years
 
02:38:30.290 --> 02:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
ago they realized that we've got to do
 
02:38:32.330 --> 02:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
something to make sure that our water is
 
02:38:34.490 --> 02:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
protected so in addition to invasive
 
02:38:37.010 --> 02:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
species they started looking at septic
 
02:38:38.510 --> 02:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
systems and they put together the
 
02:38:40.010 --> 02:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
Partridge Lake Property Owners
 
02:38:42.410 --> 02:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
Association and they raised money you
 
02:38:44.270 --> 02:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
know private money they went for Grants
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
and they started 30 years ago replacing
 
02:38:48.650 --> 02:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
septic systems educating the property
 
02:38:51.969 --> 02:38:51.979 align:start position:0%
owners about phosphorus and its effects
 
02:38:54.950 --> 02:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
they we have a you know to speak to one
 
02:38:56.630 --> 02:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
of the questions by representative Darby
 
02:38:58.969 --> 02:38:58.979 align:start position:0%
every Every Spring we get out and we
 
02:39:00.590 --> 02:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
clean the sides of the roads and we
 
02:39:01.990 --> 02:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
clean the the
 
02:39:04.910 --> 02:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
volunteers clean out the the culverts to
 
02:39:07.070 --> 02:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
really look at that anything that we can
 
02:39:09.590 --> 02:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
do to mitigate this egg that exogenous
 
02:39:11.570 --> 02:39:11.580 align:start position:0%
sources of phosphorus that's still
 
02:39:15.530 --> 02:39:15.540 align:start position:0%
coming you can't get rid of it so our
 
02:39:17.809 --> 02:39:17.819 align:start position:0%
association started taking steps 30
 
02:39:21.429 --> 02:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
years ago to hopefully avoid you know
 
02:39:24.710 --> 02:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria and other things we've we
 
02:39:26.510 --> 02:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
have commissioned a number of studies
 
02:39:30.230 --> 02:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
that I know the Des has has mentioned uh
 
02:39:32.450 --> 02:39:32.460 align:start position:0%
we identified where our phosphorus is
 
02:39:35.389 --> 02:39:35.399 align:start position:0%
coming from yes we do have external
 
02:39:37.730 --> 02:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
phosphorus that continues to come in but
 
02:39:39.349 --> 02:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
based on the stuff we've done locally
 
02:39:41.809 --> 02:39:41.819 align:start position:0%
we've largely we've addressed a lot of
 
02:39:44.590 --> 02:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
that but we have a natural phosphorus
 
02:39:47.210 --> 02:39:47.220 align:start position:0%
slug in the bottom of our Lake as a
 
02:39:50.270 --> 02:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
result of 120 years of rain going into
 
02:39:52.370 --> 02:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
to the bottom of the lake
 
02:39:55.910 --> 02:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
so we support this bill because this is
 
02:39:58.370 --> 02:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
exactly where our Lake Association we're
 
02:40:00.889 --> 02:40:00.899 align:start position:0%
ready for the next step
 
02:40:02.809 --> 02:40:02.819 align:start position:0%
um our like I said we've invested a lot
 
02:40:05.510 --> 02:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
of money and time into studies and we've
 
02:40:07.130 --> 02:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
understood that there is some mitigation
 
02:40:09.650 --> 02:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
that could be done but as much as we've
 
02:40:12.950 --> 02:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
invested this would be a good uh
 
02:40:15.230 --> 02:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to to borrow the
 
02:40:16.910 --> 02:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
money to take those next next level
 
02:40:18.950 --> 02:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
mitigation steps which would be some
 
02:40:21.770 --> 02:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
continuing excavation and some Alum
 
02:40:24.469 --> 02:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
treatments that would uh that would go a
 
02:40:28.450 --> 02:40:28.460 align:start position:0%
long way so again thinking about
 
02:40:30.290 --> 02:40:30.300 align:start position:0%
representative weeks and by the way
 
02:40:32.990 --> 02:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative weeks did that and he
 
02:40:36.349 --> 02:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
took action I got a man in his his work
 
02:40:38.090 --> 02:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
ended up in the weeks act as you
 
02:40:40.429 --> 02:40:40.439 align:start position:0%
probably know which started the national
 
02:40:42.050 --> 02:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
forest so the White Mountain National
 
02:40:44.270 --> 02:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
Forest was started in all the national
 
02:40:45.770 --> 02:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
forests was the work from a New
 
02:40:48.050 --> 02:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire native so we here in New
 
02:40:50.030 --> 02:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have an opportunity through
 
02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
276 to continue that work let's finish
 
02:40:56.030 --> 02:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
this and let's get 276 available to us
 
02:40:58.610 --> 02:40:58.620 align:start position:0%
let's get those loan funds so we've got
 
02:41:00.770 --> 02:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
a bunch of people who are really willing
 
02:41:03.410 --> 02:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
to work really willing to to do the work
 
02:41:06.830 --> 02:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
and this is that that 276 will be the
 
02:41:09.830 --> 02:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
tool that does that so
 
02:41:11.870 --> 02:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
I'm on Ways and Means and we talk about
 
02:41:13.849 --> 02:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
taxes a lot and where we get our money
 
02:41:16.790 --> 02:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
from and uh New Hampshire does not have
 
02:41:20.830 --> 02:41:20.840 align:start position:0%
a sales tax we do not have an income tax
 
02:41:24.110 --> 02:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
but we do have 800 plus bodies of water
 
02:41:26.330 --> 02:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
and those people that are coming to
 
02:41:29.690 --> 02:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
visit those 800 plus bodies water they
 
02:41:32.330 --> 02:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
they pay our meals and rooms taxes they
 
02:41:35.110 --> 02:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
buy property they buy fishing licenses
 
02:41:38.809 --> 02:41:38.819 align:start position:0%
they buy gas they buy homes they shop at
 
02:41:41.690 --> 02:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
our businesses so this is more than just
 
02:41:43.250 --> 02:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
a bunch of property owners trying to
 
02:41:45.590 --> 02:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
protect their backyards this is a real
 
02:41:47.929 --> 02:41:47.939 align:start position:0%
resource that the state has an economic
 
02:41:51.469 --> 02:41:51.479 align:start position:0%
resource that we can protect here so on
 
02:41:53.270 --> 02:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
behalf of the Partridge Lake Properties
 
02:41:56.389 --> 02:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
Owners Association we urge you to
 
02:41:58.969 --> 02:41:58.979 align:start position:0%
support 276.
 
02:42:01.309 --> 02:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
02:42:04.790 --> 02:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
for representative rochefort
 
02:42:06.950 --> 02:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative wolf
 
02:42:08.809 --> 02:42:08.819 align:start position:0%
just a quick one
 
02:42:10.250 --> 02:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
um that I probably should have asked the
 
02:42:13.849 --> 02:42:13.859 align:start position:0%
gentleman from Des before but in a
 
02:42:17.570 --> 02:42:17.580 align:start position:0%
situation that you have that's 120 plus
 
02:42:20.510 --> 02:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
years old that's the primary cause of
 
02:42:24.469 --> 02:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
your phosphorus loading can you do a
 
02:42:26.950 --> 02:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
mitigation that is
 
02:42:31.190 --> 02:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
cost effective successful
 
02:42:34.610 --> 02:42:34.620 align:start position:0%
we're convinced who you can yes
 
02:42:36.650 --> 02:42:36.660 align:start position:0%
um you know we had a the Des came up
 
02:42:38.570 --> 02:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
last summer to do a presentation to our
 
02:42:40.429 --> 02:42:40.439 align:start position:0%
properties Association uh Property
 
02:42:44.090 --> 02:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
association we've applied for the EPA
 
02:42:46.130 --> 02:42:46.140 align:start position:0%
planning Grant
 
02:42:47.450 --> 02:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
um we've gone through and worked with
 
02:42:49.849 --> 02:42:49.859 align:start position:0%
our town uh through warrant articles to
 
02:42:51.830 --> 02:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
guarantee some of these things
 
02:42:53.150 --> 02:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
um you know we've been very active for
 
02:42:56.090 --> 02:42:56.100 align:start position:0%
the last 30 years and we're convinced
 
02:42:59.270 --> 02:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
that with the external workings of
 
02:43:02.389 --> 02:43:02.399 align:start position:0%
drainage and and and working with the
 
02:43:04.730 --> 02:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
culverts and how the water gets into our
 
02:43:07.250 --> 02:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
Our Lake and also treating the lake
 
02:43:10.790 --> 02:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
we're convinced that uh that that this
 
02:43:12.410 --> 02:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
is a viable option we wouldn't be here
 
02:43:15.730 --> 02:43:15.740 align:start position:0%
supporting this if if we didn't
 
02:43:15.740 --> 02:43:17.270 align:start position:0%
supporting this if if we didn't
follow-up

02:43:17.270 --> 02:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:43:18.830 --> 02:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:19.670 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:43:19.670 --> 02:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:23.030 --> 02:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
that I understand and I'm well behind
 
02:43:25.270 --> 02:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
the septic thing
 
02:43:28.490 --> 02:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
septic research and replacement the
 
02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
drainage and all but it seems to me that
 
02:43:34.450 --> 02:43:34.460 align:start position:0%
your problem is 50
 
02:43:38.150 --> 02:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
120 years ago yeah so I mean it's it's
 
02:43:41.030 --> 02:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
the the problem started a hundred let me
 
02:43:43.070 --> 02:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
go back because we had no trees back
 
02:43:45.110 --> 02:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
then so you know the drainage just
 
02:43:47.650 --> 02:43:47.660 align:start position:0%
flowed in and now we do have trees
 
02:43:50.870 --> 02:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
the Farms that were surrounding the lake
 
02:43:52.790 --> 02:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
are no longer there in fact remember
 
02:43:54.530 --> 02:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
they're people around the lake that
 
02:43:56.090 --> 02:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
bought some of that property to ensure
 
02:43:57.590 --> 02:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
that it would never become
 
02:44:01.429 --> 02:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
you know developed again to add into our
 
02:44:04.370 --> 02:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
lake so we have and actually we have
 
02:44:06.889 --> 02:44:06.899 align:start position:0%
been complimented by the Des on the
 
02:44:09.530 --> 02:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
actions that we've taken thus far to to
 
02:44:12.410 --> 02:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
to limit that external sources of
 
02:44:14.270 --> 02:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
phosphorus and in fact if you look at
 
02:44:16.490 --> 02:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
that we we have done like I said we have
 
02:44:18.230 --> 02:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
done a number of studies on our own and
 
02:44:20.929 --> 02:44:20.939 align:start position:0%
if you look at some of that data we have
 
02:44:24.170 --> 02:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
taken a a a huge chunk out of the
 
02:44:28.190 --> 02:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
external loading of our lake so we have
 
02:44:30.650 --> 02:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
already even up to this point largely
 
02:44:33.349 --> 02:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
eliminated that largely eliminated that
 
02:44:35.630 --> 02:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
it's negligible at this point now the
 
02:44:38.270 --> 02:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
part that we would use this fund is to
 
02:44:40.969 --> 02:44:40.979 align:start position:0%
treat the phosphorus that's in there and
 
02:44:42.710 --> 02:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
we're essentially going to bind it so it
 
02:44:44.510 --> 02:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
so it can't act as food for the
 
02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:47.510 align:start position:0%
so it can't act as food for the
cyanobacteria

02:44:47.510 --> 02:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:49.010 --> 02:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
02:44:51.230 --> 02:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
representative representative Harvey
 
02:44:51.240 --> 02:44:52.849 align:start position:0%
representative representative Harvey
bowley

02:44:52.849 --> 02:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
bowley
 
02:44:54.950 --> 02:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you just a quick question uh thank
 
02:44:56.690 --> 02:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony and can you
 
02:44:59.150 --> 02:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
describe elaborate a little bit more how
 
02:45:03.410 --> 02:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
you would do this binding uh and and
 
02:45:05.389 --> 02:45:05.399 align:start position:0%
treating of the water thank you yeah so
 
02:45:07.370 --> 02:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
uh fortunately Des I believe is still
 
02:45:09.349 --> 02:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
here so if we get into some more
 
02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
chemical uh stuff that then that they
 
02:45:14.450 --> 02:45:14.460 align:start position:0%
can they can come save me but
 
02:45:17.330 --> 02:45:17.340 align:start position:0%
um the the process is actually we don't
 
02:45:19.370 --> 02:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
do it a lot in New Hampshire and I think
 
02:45:20.870 --> 02:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
he alluded to the fact that we're just
 
02:45:24.290 --> 02:45:24.300 align:start position:0%
not set up regulatory wise to do it and
 
02:45:26.150 --> 02:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been a a widespread issue
 
02:45:29.990 --> 02:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
until probably 10 years ago but there is
 
02:45:33.830 --> 02:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
a treatment of Alum a-l-u-m that's used
 
02:45:35.990 --> 02:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
um in Lakes it's been widely used
 
02:45:38.270 --> 02:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
throughout other parts of the country I
 
02:45:40.309 --> 02:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
know when they came to to do the
 
02:45:43.790 --> 02:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
presentation this summer I I said I've
 
02:45:45.590 --> 02:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
never heard of this so you know I did my
 
02:45:47.330 --> 02:45:47.340 align:start position:0%
own research and
 
02:45:49.550 --> 02:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
um it's been widely used in the midwest
 
02:45:52.429 --> 02:45:52.439 align:start position:0%
Illinois Iowa those are the states that
 
02:45:54.349 --> 02:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
I came across
 
02:45:58.070 --> 02:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
okay studies where it's been done and
 
02:45:59.990 --> 02:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know they you know
 
02:46:02.929 --> 02:46:02.939 align:start position:0%
at a high level they they determine how
 
02:46:04.910 --> 02:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
much they their Studies have to go into
 
02:46:07.610 --> 02:46:07.620 align:start position:0%
to the lake then they determine how much
 
02:46:09.590 --> 02:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
of this stuff has to be applied to the
 
02:46:12.050 --> 02:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
lake uh they apply it to the certain
 
02:46:13.790 --> 02:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
areas of the lake where the phosphorus
 
02:46:15.530 --> 02:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
is settled on the bottom in higher
 
02:46:18.590 --> 02:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
concentrations and uh and it you know
 
02:46:21.530 --> 02:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
there's a binding effect to it and it
 
02:46:23.870 --> 02:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
deactivates the phosphorus so it can't
 
02:46:25.849 --> 02:46:25.859 align:start position:0%
act as a as a nutrient because now
 
02:46:27.950 --> 02:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
you've got a chemical reaction that that
 
02:46:30.950 --> 02:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:32.450 --> 02:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
02:46:32.460 --> 02:46:34.670 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
representative

02:46:34.670 --> 02:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:46:36.290 --> 02:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
 
02:46:37.910 --> 02:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:46:39.950 --> 02:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
I have no more pink cards is there
 
02:46:41.690 --> 02:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
anyone that didn't fill out a pink card
 
02:46:46.070 --> 02:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
that wants to speak on HB 276.
 
02:46:48.650 --> 02:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
seeing no one approaching the mic I'm
 
02:46:51.710 --> 02:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
going to declare the hearing on HB 276
 
02:46:51.720 --> 02:46:55.309 align:start position:0%
going to declare the hearing on HB 276
closed

02:46:55.309 --> 02:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:55.319 --> 02:46:57.410 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:46:57.410 --> 02:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:47:15.710 --> 02:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:15.720 --> 02:47:57.790 align:start position:0%

02:49:26.349 --> 02:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:28.490 --> 02:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
I always thought you were a kind and
 
02:49:37.090 --> 02:49:37.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:39.650 --> 02:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
all right let me just got the bill let's
 
02:49:41.150 --> 02:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
get this on the road
 
02:49:45.550 --> 02:49:45.560 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call to order a house bill
 
02:49:49.969 --> 02:49:49.979 align:start position:0%
534 relative to water assistance for
 
02:49:55.429 --> 02:49:55.439 align:start position:0%
natural disasters I represent our res I
 
02:49:58.790 --> 02:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
I recognize representative Boyd Mr
 
02:50:00.290 --> 02:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you very much I
 
02:50:01.969 --> 02:50:01.979 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and through you to my

Recreation and development committee my
 
02:50:08.389 --> 02:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
name is Bill Boyd I represent Hillsboro
 
02:50:11.090 --> 02:50:11.100 align:start position:0%
District 12 in the town of Merrimack
 
02:50:13.309 --> 02:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
I also serve as chairman of the New
 
02:50:14.950 --> 02:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire drinking water and groundwater
 
02:50:17.389 --> 02:50:17.399 align:start position:0%
advisory commission
 
02:50:19.790 --> 02:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
um worthy of note your colleague
 
02:50:21.410 --> 02:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
representative Gould is also a
 
02:50:23.090 --> 02:50:23.100 align:start position:0%
distinguished member of the commission
 
02:50:25.790 --> 02:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
as well where she has served with with
 
02:50:28.849 --> 02:50:28.859 align:start position:0%
the plum and integrity during her time
 
02:50:30.710 --> 02:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
on the tenure so I'm very grateful for
 
02:50:34.270 --> 02:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
her service to the commission this bill
 
02:50:36.889 --> 02:50:36.899 align:start position:0%
specifically creates a water assistance
 
02:50:40.309 --> 02:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
fund to deal with replacing drinking
 
02:50:42.469 --> 02:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
water sources that have been damaged by
 
02:50:44.750 --> 02:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
by natural disasters and natural
 
02:50:47.750 --> 02:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
disasters obviously over the last uh
 
02:50:49.670 --> 02:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
three to four years New Hampshire has
 
02:50:51.410 --> 02:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
been in what I would call a significant
 
02:50:54.050 --> 02:50:54.060 align:start position:0%
drought now lately we're no longer in
 
02:50:57.530 --> 02:50:57.540 align:start position:0%
that drought and I'll get to that point
 
02:50:59.450 --> 02:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
um a little further along but the
 
02:51:02.750 --> 02:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
Genesis behind this bill emanated from
 
02:51:07.010 --> 02:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
my commission uh back in 2020 where we
 
02:51:09.530 --> 02:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
were approached by the chairman of the
 
02:51:10.730 --> 02:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
commission at that time Senate President
 
02:51:13.490 --> 02:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
Chuck Morse worked with
 
02:51:15.710 --> 02:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
um staff from Des to come up with an
 
02:51:18.230 --> 02:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
emergency funding program
 
02:51:21.650 --> 02:51:21.660 align:start position:0%
uh where we allocated 1.5 million
 
02:51:25.910 --> 02:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
dollars to Target at need homeowners
 
02:51:28.790 --> 02:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
that needed recovery in order to have
 
02:51:32.150 --> 02:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
access to clean potable water we created
 
02:51:35.389 --> 02:51:35.399 align:start position:0%
a two-tiered system one tier which
 
02:51:38.330 --> 02:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
allowed a homeowner to pay a deductible
 
02:51:40.550 --> 02:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
into the program in a tier two a tier 2
 
02:51:42.770 --> 02:51:42.780 align:start position:0%
component which was based strictly on
 
02:51:47.210 --> 02:51:47.220 align:start position:0%
need based on the mhi qualifications
 
02:51:49.190 --> 02:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
that have that the federal government
 
02:51:51.410 --> 02:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
has has promulgated
 
02:51:51.420 --> 02:51:52.190 align:start position:0%
has has promulgated
um

02:51:52.190 --> 02:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:53.870 --> 02:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
behind me and I forgot to make my
 
02:51:55.969 --> 02:51:55.979 align:start position:0%
introductions to commissioner Scott and
 
02:51:58.190 --> 02:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
the administrator of the trust fund Dr
 
02:52:00.769 --> 02:52:00.779 align:start position:0%
Cheryl Bondi she can obviously get
 
02:52:03.110 --> 02:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
granular more onto the details of the of
 
02:52:07.370 --> 02:52:07.380 align:start position:0%
the fund but the focus is to build upon
 
02:52:09.710 --> 02:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
what the commission had done has done
 
02:52:11.090 --> 02:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
over the last
 
02:52:14.630 --> 02:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
three years as it relates to improving
 
02:52:17.809 --> 02:52:17.819 align:start position:0%
the quality of of home of homeowners
 
02:52:21.469 --> 02:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
needing access access to water right now
 
02:52:21.479 --> 02:52:22.809 align:start position:0%
needing access access to water right now
with

02:52:22.809 --> 02:52:22.819 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:52:25.910 --> 02:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
the uh the commission we've already
 
02:52:28.490 --> 02:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
allocated 3.2 million dollars we've
 
02:52:28.500 --> 02:52:29.290 align:start position:0%
allocated 3.2 million dollars we've
spent

02:52:29.290 --> 02:52:29.300 align:start position:0%
spent
 
02:52:33.170 --> 02:52:33.180 align:start position:0%
2.75 so right now roughly about 400 400
 
02:52:37.490 --> 02:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
000 is a 400 400 000 is is unobligated
 
02:52:40.429 --> 02:52:40.439 align:start position:0%
we're looking to create this program to
 
02:52:42.410 --> 02:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
be managed directly through the
 
02:52:44.150 --> 02:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services so
 
02:52:47.929 --> 02:52:47.939 align:start position:0%
that the the commission can pivot
 
02:52:50.630 --> 02:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
into what it was originally designed
 
02:52:55.450 --> 02:52:55.460 align:start position:0%
under under 485 which is to provide
 
02:52:57.650 --> 02:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
cost-sharing grants and cost sharing
 
02:53:01.130 --> 02:53:01.140 align:start position:0%
loan money is targeting on uh pollution
 
02:53:02.990 --> 02:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
and contamination issues Source water
 
02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:04.610 align:start position:0%
and contamination issues Source water
development

02:53:04.610 --> 02:53:04.620 align:start position:0%
development
 
02:53:06.410 --> 02:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
um infrastructure getting municipalities
 
02:53:08.630 --> 02:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
over the hump with some with some of
 
02:53:12.889 --> 02:53:12.899 align:start position:0%
their water water projects so that
 
02:53:17.510 --> 02:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
from from that standpoint Des can create
 
02:53:19.130 --> 02:53:19.140 align:start position:0%
the specific rules so that they can
 
02:53:22.090 --> 02:53:22.100 align:start position:0%
independently uh administer the program
 
02:53:26.090 --> 02:53:26.100 align:start position:0%
to again work with homeowners that may
 
02:53:30.170 --> 02:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
have experienced an a natural disaster
 
02:53:30.180 --> 02:53:32.510 align:start position:0%
have experienced an a natural disaster
um

02:53:32.510 --> 02:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:34.730 --> 02:53:34.740 align:start position:0%
these last couple of years not
 
02:53:36.889 --> 02:53:36.899 align:start position:0%
necessarily I mean the Southern Tier of
 
02:53:39.469 --> 02:53:39.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I would say has been
 
02:53:42.050 --> 02:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
impacted but I would also argue that
 
02:53:45.410 --> 02:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
it's been the the North Country uh
 
02:53:47.450 --> 02:53:47.460 align:start position:0%
people in in the central part of New
 
02:53:47.460 --> 02:53:48.889 align:start position:0%
people in in the central part of New
Hampshire

02:53:48.889 --> 02:53:48.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:53:50.570 --> 02:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
um that have been impacted by the
 
02:53:52.670 --> 02:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
drought where Wells have dried up and
 
02:53:54.530 --> 02:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
they've applied to the commission for
 
02:53:57.349 --> 02:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
for assistance in having a driller
 
02:54:00.469 --> 02:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
coming out to either do some fracking
 
02:54:02.809 --> 02:54:02.819 align:start position:0%
work or to try and reperk the old well
 
02:54:05.030 --> 02:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
or find a new location for a well to be
 
02:54:08.450 --> 02:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
able to provide potable water in getting
 
02:54:10.130 --> 02:54:10.140 align:start position:0%
a driller out to these locations has
 
02:54:11.929 --> 02:54:11.939 align:start position:0%
been especially challenging the the
 
02:54:14.090 --> 02:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
Drillers that we have in state are
 
02:54:18.010 --> 02:54:18.020 align:start position:0%
pretty much working 24 7 365
 
02:54:20.090 --> 02:54:20.100 align:start position:0%
with very little with very little
 
02:54:22.730 --> 02:54:22.740 align:start position:0%
bandwidth they're constantly uh going
 
02:54:25.010 --> 02:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
out not just with the Hallmarks that
 
02:54:26.150 --> 02:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
come through our program but through
 
02:54:28.730 --> 02:54:28.740 align:start position:0%
other other developments that may be
 
02:54:29.990 --> 02:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
going on in the state where they're
 
02:54:32.210 --> 02:54:32.220 align:start position:0%
actually doing the work trying to to
 
02:54:34.790 --> 02:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
create create and Bill Wells for for
 
02:54:37.790 --> 02:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
either homeowners or developers so in
 
02:54:39.889 --> 02:54:39.899 align:start position:0%
coming full circle because I certainly
 
02:54:43.070 --> 02:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
want to answer answer your questions
 
02:54:43.080 --> 02:54:45.590 align:start position:0%
want to answer answer your questions
um

02:54:45.590 --> 02:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:48.469 --> 02:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
the last last three years at the
 
02:54:48.479 --> 02:54:49.969 align:start position:0%
the last last three years at the
commission

02:54:49.969 --> 02:54:49.979 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:54:49.979 --> 02:54:51.290 align:start position:0%
commission
um

02:54:51.290 --> 02:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:53.690 --> 02:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
what originally started out as as an
 
02:54:55.389 --> 02:54:55.399 align:start position:0%
emergency program
 
02:54:58.190 --> 02:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
emerged into something where we're
 
02:55:01.910 --> 02:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
having a positive value on
 
02:55:04.490 --> 02:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
on homeowners that that are for the lack
 
02:55:06.230 --> 02:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
of a better term and I apologize for
 
02:55:09.650 --> 02:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
them that are Income challenge that may
 
02:55:11.210 --> 02:55:11.220 align:start position:0%
not be able to that don't have the
 
02:55:14.630 --> 02:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to be able to
 
02:55:17.870 --> 02:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
um fund the development or Redevelopment
 
02:55:21.110 --> 02:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
of the of their own Wells so
 
02:55:23.450 --> 02:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
um I'm very proud of one of the things I
 
02:55:25.190 --> 02:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
do want to amplify is I'm very proud of
 
02:55:27.110 --> 02:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
the the level of technical expertise
 
02:55:28.790 --> 02:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
that we have on the commission we've had
 
02:55:32.090 --> 02:55:32.100 align:start position:0%
a representative from uh Concord Water
 
02:55:34.490 --> 02:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
Works in pennichuck
 
02:55:36.650 --> 02:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
um his name is Jason Gagnon I forget who
 
02:55:38.150 --> 02:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
Jason works for but he does a lot of
 
02:55:39.710 --> 02:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
work up in the North Country Andrea
 
02:55:42.590 --> 02:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
Cantor again we've had significant
 
02:55:44.630 --> 02:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
professional technical expertise that
 
02:55:46.670 --> 02:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
has worked on on a myriad of projects
 
02:55:47.870 --> 02:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
like this that have come through the
 
02:55:49.910 --> 02:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
commission that has allowed us to be
 
02:55:52.309 --> 02:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
able to make sure that these that these
 
02:55:55.610 --> 02:55:55.620 align:start position:0%
projects as it relates to the lawn
 
02:55:57.710 --> 02:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
program that that
 
02:55:59.389 --> 02:55:59.399 align:start position:0%
that they're cost efficient they're
 
02:56:01.330 --> 02:56:01.340 align:start position:0%
effective in in this solving a problem
 
02:56:04.370 --> 02:56:04.380 align:start position:0%
and obviously we can't do any of that
 
02:56:06.769 --> 02:56:06.779 align:start position:0%
good work without the good Folks at DES
 
02:56:10.010 --> 02:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott Dr Bondi and the rest
 
02:56:11.630 --> 02:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
of the team at DES for the Yeomans work
 
02:56:13.969 --> 02:56:13.979 align:start position:0%
that they do uh day in and day out not
 
02:56:16.070 --> 02:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
just for this program but for the
 
02:56:18.469 --> 02:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
success of my commission so
 
02:56:20.809 --> 02:56:20.819 align:start position:0%
um again you have my letter I would
 
02:56:22.490 --> 02:56:22.500 align:start position:0%
encourage you to please read my letter
 
02:56:25.610 --> 02:56:25.620 align:start position:0%
which kind of puts uh some more more
 
02:56:27.830 --> 02:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
flesh on the skeleton that explains the
 
02:56:30.050 --> 02:56:30.060 align:start position:0%
goals and I certainly would be more than
 
02:56:32.030 --> 02:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
happy to entertain any questions and I
 
02:56:33.170 --> 02:56:33.180 align:start position:0%
thank the chairman and the committee for
 
02:56:36.650 --> 02:56:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:39.830 --> 02:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the board of
 
02:56:44.030 --> 02:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:47.150 --> 02:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
remember representative McHugh thank you
 
02:56:49.010 --> 02:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you representative
 
02:56:52.190 --> 02:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
Boyd for bringing this bill for uh for
 
02:56:54.290 --> 02:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
the whole state and and of course for
 
02:56:56.330 --> 02:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
our district since half the
 
02:56:58.969 --> 02:56:58.979 align:start position:0%
delegation is in the room
 
02:56:58.979 --> 02:56:59.750 align:start position:0%
delegation is in the room
um

02:56:59.750 --> 02:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:02.030 --> 02:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
can you tell us a little bit about how
 
02:57:05.870 --> 02:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
this bill affects not just the town of
 
02:57:07.370 --> 02:57:07.380 align:start position:0%
Merrimack our district but the whole
 
02:57:09.410 --> 02:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
state I I think it may have come as a
 
02:57:12.050 --> 02:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
surprise it did a little bit to me uh
 
02:57:13.849 --> 02:57:13.859 align:start position:0%
that the state's been in drought
 
02:57:16.910 --> 02:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
conditions uh for a while and so I don't
 
02:57:18.590 --> 02:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
want people to think it's just a
 
02:57:21.170 --> 02:57:21.180 align:start position:0%
Merrimack bill that it really is a whole
 
02:57:23.570 --> 02:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
State issue
 
02:57:25.190 --> 02:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
but can you elaborate a little bit on
 
02:57:26.630 --> 02:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
that absolutely and I appreciate the
 
02:57:27.590 --> 02:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much
 
02:57:27.600 --> 02:57:29.150 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much
representative

02:57:29.150 --> 02:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:57:29.160 --> 02:57:31.429 align:start position:0%
representative
um

02:57:31.429 --> 02:57:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:33.250 --> 02:57:33.260 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
02:57:37.550 --> 02:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
relies on two things we rely on snow and
 
02:57:43.790 --> 02:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:46.250 --> 02:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
those materials to make its way from the
 
02:57:48.590 --> 02:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
north down south into our groundwater to
 
02:57:51.650 --> 02:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
be able to fill our Lakes feel rivers
 
02:57:55.370 --> 02:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
and streams and be able to percolate the
 
02:57:57.290 --> 02:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
the aquifers that exist throughout our
 
02:58:00.650 --> 02:58:00.660 align:start position:0%
state in the last four years you know
 
02:58:02.570 --> 02:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
those particular levels have been have
 
02:58:04.849 --> 02:58:04.859 align:start position:0%
been extremely small for the for the
 
02:58:08.330 --> 02:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
lack of a better term and
 
02:58:10.910 --> 02:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
since my time on the commission and and
 
02:58:13.490 --> 02:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
then since joining the legislature
 
02:58:14.750 --> 02:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
um and being a part of this commission
 
02:58:17.389 --> 02:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
we've always been given updates in in
 
02:58:19.610 --> 02:58:19.620 align:start position:0%
if it's if it's not red it's orange if
 
02:58:20.929 --> 02:58:20.939 align:start position:0%
it's not Orange it's yellow there's
 
02:58:23.809 --> 02:58:23.819 align:start position:0%
never anything opaque that's on the map
 
02:58:26.570 --> 02:58:26.580 align:start position:0%
that that suggests that we're out of a
 
02:58:28.010 --> 02:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
drought now
 
02:58:30.650 --> 02:58:30.660 align:start position:0%
not not the name drop but um Mur
 
02:58:32.750 --> 02:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
meteorologist Haley Lapointe just
 
02:58:35.150 --> 02:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
indicated to us that we're really no
 
02:58:37.370 --> 02:58:37.380 align:start position:0%
longer in a in a drought situation Dr
 
02:58:40.790 --> 02:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
Bondi also confirmed that for me but
 
02:58:42.889 --> 02:58:42.899 align:start position:0%
well that's well that's good news for
 
02:58:44.450 --> 02:58:44.460 align:start position:0%
the interim that we're out of a drought
 
02:58:44.460 --> 02:58:45.590 align:start position:0%
the interim that we're out of a drought
situation

02:58:45.590 --> 02:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:58:48.410 --> 02:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
all it takes is to go several leaks
 
02:58:51.050 --> 02:58:51.060 align:start position:0%
without any rain that's going to to
 
02:58:53.809 --> 02:58:53.819 align:start position:0%
siphon that snowpack is going to snipe
 
02:58:56.750 --> 02:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
and the siphon that that rain water away
 
02:58:58.849 --> 02:58:58.859 align:start position:0%
from from doing what it needs to do and
 
02:59:01.610 --> 02:59:01.620 align:start position:0%
subsequently those levels of groundwater
 
02:59:04.190 --> 02:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
that are necessary to to fill our wells
 
02:59:06.290 --> 02:59:06.300 align:start position:0%
and to fill our reservoirs and and to be
 
02:59:06.300 --> 02:59:07.370 align:start position:0%
and to fill our reservoirs and and to be
able

02:59:07.370 --> 02:59:07.380 align:start position:0%
able
 
02:59:09.349 --> 02:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
um to fill our ribs to let the the
 
02:59:11.389 --> 02:59:11.399 align:start position:0%
Public Water Systems be able to do its
 
02:59:13.370 --> 02:59:13.380 align:start position:0%
job it's going to have is having a
 
02:59:14.990 --> 02:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
significant impact at that particular
 
02:59:17.150 --> 02:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
level so circling back to your original
 
02:59:19.849 --> 02:59:19.859 align:start position:0%
question you know we we rely on Mother
 
02:59:19.859 --> 02:59:21.170 align:start position:0%
question you know we we rely on Mother
Nature

02:59:21.170 --> 02:59:21.180 align:start position:0%
Nature
 
02:59:23.210 --> 02:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide clean potable
 
02:59:24.830 --> 02:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
water to every single Granite stator
 
02:59:26.870 --> 02:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
that lives here in New Hampshire and if
 
02:59:29.450 --> 02:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
Mother Nature regretfully is not not
 
02:59:31.790 --> 02:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
doing the job that we've asked her to do
 
02:59:35.510 --> 02:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
then you know certain situations are
 
02:59:39.110 --> 02:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
occur I.E private homeowner Wells are
 
02:59:42.469 --> 02:59:42.479 align:start position:0%
drying up and they are left without a
 
02:59:45.050 --> 02:59:45.060 align:start position:0%
resource to be able to get into to
 
02:59:50.269 --> 02:59:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:52.070 --> 02:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
02:59:53.510 --> 02:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
my question and that that's really
 
02:59:55.010 --> 02:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
helpful when I read your test
 
02:59:56.990 --> 02:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
testimonial coffee this morning I
 
03:00:00.590 --> 03:00:00.600 align:start position:0%
thought water natural disasters floods
 
03:00:03.349 --> 03:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
so in our district the flood that I
 
03:00:05.750 --> 03:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
think of is the like Wildcat Falls
 
03:00:08.030 --> 03:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
Beacon Drive that's where we have floods
 
03:00:11.090 --> 03:00:11.100 align:start position:0%
every year so for the the Merrimack
 
03:00:13.690 --> 03:00:13.700 align:start position:0%
constituents is this money accessible
 
03:00:16.910 --> 03:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
for that type of situation that flood
 
03:00:19.670 --> 03:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
zone that I think of in for those
 
03:00:21.469 --> 03:00:21.479 align:start position:0%
Merrimack residents maybe listening to
 
03:00:23.389 --> 03:00:23.399 align:start position:0%
this so if a flood contaminates a
 
03:00:26.090 --> 03:00:26.100 align:start position:0%
private well and that homeowner meets
 
03:00:28.849 --> 03:00:28.859 align:start position:0%
the income qualifications that would
 
03:00:31.190 --> 03:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
allow income qualifications in the
 
03:00:34.070 --> 03:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
criteria to have the application be
 
03:00:36.769 --> 03:00:36.779 align:start position:0%
reviewed for consideration the answer is
 
03:00:38.330 --> 03:00:38.340 align:start position:0%
yes this helps them great so it helps
 
03:00:40.250 --> 03:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
them so this criteria that's involved
 
03:00:42.889 --> 03:00:42.899 align:start position:0%
that that need to be met in order for a
 
03:00:45.590 --> 03:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
homeowner to be able to receive uh
 
03:00:47.929 --> 03:00:47.939 align:start position:0%
funding from the program and and in in
 
03:00:50.990 --> 03:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
in Fierce Dr Dr Bondi put this together
 
03:00:52.309 --> 03:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
I mean looking at some of the
 
03:00:54.230 --> 03:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
applications I mean it's
 
03:00:56.090 --> 03:00:56.100 align:start position:0%
I mean in the southern part of the state
 
03:00:58.910 --> 03:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
I mean Dairy had applications Kingston
 
03:01:00.710 --> 03:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
had applications Hampstead had
 
03:01:03.830 --> 03:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
applications Hudson had applications and
 
03:01:06.650 --> 03:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
then you go to places like Tamworth and
 
03:01:08.990 --> 03:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
Jaffrey and Jefferson
 
03:01:12.110 --> 03:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
um you know so it's it's not limited to
 
03:01:15.170 --> 03:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
you know the obviously we think of the
 
03:01:17.929 --> 03:01:17.939 align:start position:0%
Southern Tier being more
 
03:01:21.170 --> 03:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
having more readily accessible access to
 
03:01:23.630 --> 03:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
resources such as infrastructure to be
 
03:01:26.990 --> 03:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
able to to tap into a public water
 
03:01:29.389 --> 03:01:29.399 align:start position:0%
source like Hawk like pentachuck like
 
03:01:31.730 --> 03:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
for represented by Merrimack Village
 
03:01:33.250 --> 03:01:33.260 align:start position:0%
Water District for the North Country
 
03:01:35.690 --> 03:01:35.700 align:start position:0%
those those resources are very limited
 
03:01:38.690 --> 03:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
private Wells are necessary to provide
 
03:01:40.670 --> 03:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
potable water to the to the house so
 
03:01:42.830 --> 03:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
it's a process correct is this a is this
 
03:01:44.929 --> 03:01:44.939 align:start position:0%
a drop in the bucket sorry no further
 
03:01:46.670 --> 03:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
questions yeah okay
 
03:01:49.429 --> 03:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
is this a drop in the bucket so this
 
03:01:51.650 --> 03:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
what is what I would say a necessary
 
03:01:53.750 --> 03:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
first step to continuing the mission
 
03:01:56.170 --> 03:01:56.180 align:start position:0%
that the commission has set out
 
03:01:59.630 --> 03:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
regarding being able to provide a
 
03:02:01.849 --> 03:02:01.859 align:start position:0%
funding program to
 
03:02:05.150 --> 03:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh income challenge homeowners so the
 
03:02:07.790 --> 03:02:07.800 align:start position:0%
impetus being by putting it in you know
 
03:02:09.950 --> 03:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
by having it being a part of a line item
 
03:02:12.290 --> 03:02:12.300 align:start position:0%
and Des allows them you know greater
 
03:02:14.889 --> 03:02:14.899 align:start position:0%
autonomy they're allowed a rule set
 
03:02:18.110 --> 03:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to be creative in
 
03:02:20.330 --> 03:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
working with homeowners to to get in
 
03:02:21.889 --> 03:02:21.899 align:start position:0%
there to help them to meet the criteria
 
03:02:24.590 --> 03:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
so that's the way that I would look at
 
03:02:27.469 --> 03:02:27.479 align:start position:0%
it thank you yep you're welcome
 
03:02:29.510 --> 03:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative
 
03:02:34.250 --> 03:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:36.469 --> 03:02:36.479 align:start position:0%
Erin and thank you representative Boyd
 
03:02:38.630 --> 03:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and thank you
 
03:02:40.190 --> 03:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
very much for bringing this bill forward
 
03:02:42.590 --> 03:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
and recognizing the need to help people
 
03:02:44.630 --> 03:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
out with ensuring they have safe
 
03:02:47.809 --> 03:02:47.819 align:start position:0%
drinking water my question is is the
 
03:02:49.670 --> 03:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill particularly on
 
03:02:51.610 --> 03:02:51.620 align:start position:0%
looking at line 13
 
03:02:54.349 --> 03:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh it's to provide for the replacement
 
03:02:57.230 --> 03:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
repair and treatment of private Drinking
 
03:03:00.290 --> 03:03:00.300 align:start position:0%
Water Resources but when I look at the
 
03:03:03.950 --> 03:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal note from Des it says it's for
 
03:03:06.170 --> 03:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
repair and replacement of drinking water
 
03:03:08.870 --> 03:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
treatment sources and I was just
 
03:03:11.030 --> 03:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
wondering if
 
03:03:11.040 --> 03:03:12.050 align:start position:0%
wondering if
um

03:03:12.050 --> 03:03:12.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:14.389 --> 03:03:14.399 align:start position:0%
is there do you see a difference between
 
03:03:16.790 --> 03:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
sources of drinking water and drinking
 
03:03:18.950 --> 03:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
water treatment sources so it's what do
 
03:03:20.389 --> 03:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
you say that I picked up on that as well
 
03:03:23.389 --> 03:03:23.399 align:start position:0%
oh okay and I and I I actually
 
03:03:25.070 --> 03:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
um I would need to talk offline with
 
03:03:27.230 --> 03:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott and Dr Bondi about
 
03:03:29.150 --> 03:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
that so that
 
03:03:31.250 --> 03:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
one has to be compatible with the other
 
03:03:34.250 --> 03:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
uh from from a language standpoint but I
 
03:03:36.290 --> 03:03:36.300 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the nuance
 
03:03:39.349 --> 03:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:41.450 --> 03:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:03:43.370 --> 03:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
representative Darby
 
03:03:45.050 --> 03:03:45.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:03:46.670 --> 03:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:03:50.090 --> 03:03:50.100 align:start position:0%
um very naive question but are there
 
03:03:53.510 --> 03:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
um options available for private
 
03:03:57.290 --> 03:03:57.300 align:start position:0%
insurance for Wells to to you know to
 
03:03:58.790 --> 03:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
account for natural disasters like the
 
03:04:01.429 --> 03:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
are for fun floods representative Darby
 
03:04:02.630 --> 03:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and it's it's
 
03:04:04.370 --> 03:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
not naive it's a it's a good question
 
03:04:06.530 --> 03:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
because when you have a homeowner's
 
03:04:08.150 --> 03:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
insurance depending on where you live if
 
03:04:09.769 --> 03:04:09.779 align:start position:0%
you live in a flood plain flood
 
03:04:12.710 --> 03:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
insurance is generally a requirement of
 
03:04:15.830 --> 03:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
of home of home ownership as it relates
 
03:04:17.929 --> 03:04:17.939 align:start position:0%
and relates to national disasters
 
03:04:21.110 --> 03:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
natural disasters excuse me I
 
03:04:22.969 --> 03:04:22.979 align:start position:0%
I would be speaking off the top of my
 
03:04:25.550 --> 03:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
head and my initial inclination would be
 
03:04:28.070 --> 03:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
that if there was a proclivity like
 
03:04:30.230 --> 03:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
let's say living not not to bring up
 
03:04:31.670 --> 03:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
another state but if we were living in
 
03:04:34.309 --> 03:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
California on the San Andreas fault I
 
03:04:36.650 --> 03:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
would think that you know earthquake
 
03:04:38.510 --> 03:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
earthquake insurance would not be a
 
03:04:39.889 --> 03:04:39.899 align:start position:0%
supplemental Rider I would think that
 
03:04:42.349 --> 03:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
would be a component but earthquakes in
 
03:04:45.170 --> 03:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are a rarity but I would
 
03:04:47.690 --> 03:04:47.700 align:start position:0%
contend to you since there has been an
 
03:04:51.230 --> 03:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
uptick in in geospatial shifts here in
 
03:04:53.870 --> 03:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that the possibility of an
 
03:04:56.389 --> 03:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
earthquake impacting an aquifer which
 
03:04:58.670 --> 03:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
impacts a neighborhood of private Wells
 
03:05:01.730 --> 03:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
that suddenly a well that was flushed
 
03:05:04.130 --> 03:05:04.140 align:start position:0%
with water automatically goes dry yeah
 
03:05:06.110 --> 03:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's a concern whether or not
 
03:05:08.090 --> 03:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
that's something that a homeowner would
 
03:05:10.190 --> 03:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
need to buy to ensure
 
03:05:11.630 --> 03:05:11.640 align:start position:0%
um I I honestly wouldn't know the
 
03:05:14.450 --> 03:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
question but I would think that it's
 
03:05:16.670 --> 03:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
possible that it could be an insurable
 
03:05:16.680 --> 03:05:18.410 align:start position:0%
possible that it could be an insurable
event

03:05:18.410 --> 03:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
event
 
03:05:22.990 --> 03:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:29.870 --> 03:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:34.849 --> 03:05:34.859 align:start position:0%
would you consider the need to have a
 
03:05:37.370 --> 03:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
to include not just natural disasters
 
03:05:40.370 --> 03:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
but if someone has a contamination of
 
03:05:41.950 --> 03:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
their water source
 
03:05:45.889 --> 03:05:45.899 align:start position:0%
from a organic chemical or non-agamic so
 
03:05:48.309 --> 03:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
the the the target
 
03:05:51.410 --> 03:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
for this bill is
 
03:05:54.590 --> 03:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
is natural disasters there's other
 
03:05:57.050 --> 03:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
legislation your colleague has a has a
 
03:05:58.490 --> 03:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
bill going through right now that
 
03:06:01.250 --> 03:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
specifically targets uh pfos I've signed
 
03:06:04.910 --> 03:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
on to a Senate bill that targets pfos my
 
03:06:07.309 --> 03:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
commission um as it relates to
 
03:06:09.889 --> 03:06:09.899 align:start position:0%
contamination issues we're dealing uh
 
03:06:11.330 --> 03:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with the gamut not just
 
03:06:13.309 --> 03:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
pfas but
 
03:06:16.730 --> 03:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
um Iron manganese arsenic there are
 
03:06:18.410 --> 03:06:18.420 align:start position:0%
there's at least one or two communities
 
03:06:21.830 --> 03:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
that has naturally organic uranium that
 
03:06:24.710 --> 03:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
is occurring that is polluting drinking
 
03:06:27.110 --> 03:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
well sources so
 
03:06:27.120 --> 03:06:27.950 align:start position:0%
well sources so
um

03:06:27.950 --> 03:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:30.110 --> 03:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
the intent is to and I don't mean to be
 
03:06:32.870 --> 03:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh have the bill be myopic but is it is
 
03:06:35.030 --> 03:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
focused targeting need towards
 
03:06:37.550 --> 03:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
homeowners that have seen their Wells
 
03:06:41.030 --> 03:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
gone dry and uh need need assistance in
 
03:06:43.730 --> 03:06:43.740 align:start position:0%
being able to be able to provide clean
 
03:06:45.950 --> 03:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
potable water to not just themselves but
 
03:06:47.630 --> 03:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
the but the family or the people that
 
03:06:49.250 --> 03:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
live in their house but it's a fair
 
03:06:53.870 --> 03:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:56.570 --> 03:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
anyone else from the members of the
 
03:06:58.730 --> 03:06:58.740 align:start position:0%
committee for a question
 
03:07:03.469 --> 03:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
I guess Scrooge has the his chance to so
 
03:07:05.690 --> 03:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
I will have a question I was hoping you
 
03:07:07.370 --> 03:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
would Mr chair yes
 
03:07:07.380 --> 03:07:10.429 align:start position:0%
would Mr chair yes
um

03:07:10.429 --> 03:07:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:10.439 --> 03:07:12.889 align:start position:0%
 
our

03:07:12.889 --> 03:07:12.899 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:07:16.969 --> 03:07:16.979 align:start position:0%
what what is the well first of all
 
03:07:21.230 --> 03:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
why can this not be available to all
 
03:07:21.240 --> 03:07:22.309 align:start position:0%
why can this not be available to all
people

03:07:22.309 --> 03:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:07:25.610 --> 03:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
well it is it's going to be no no it's
 
03:07:27.650 --> 03:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
only available to people at a certain
 
03:07:30.050 --> 03:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
income level
 
03:07:33.830 --> 03:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
okay I apologize I apologize and I
 
03:07:35.630 --> 03:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
apologize too I shouldn't have gone back
 
03:07:38.150 --> 03:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
and forth but I should have asked myself
 
03:07:41.210 --> 03:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
for if I could do another question and
 
03:07:43.730 --> 03:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
then we noticed and and I and I will ask
 
03:07:47.929 --> 03:07:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:50.269 --> 03:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:07:50.279 --> 03:07:52.429 align:start position:0%
the uh
at

03:07:52.429 --> 03:07:52.439 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:07:56.750 --> 03:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
you know the originally you're
 
03:08:00.490 --> 03:08:00.500 align:start position:0%
your organization was based around
 
03:08:03.469 --> 03:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
basically pollution correct which is
 
03:08:07.490 --> 03:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
base which was something unforeseen
 
03:08:11.210 --> 03:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
yeah uh not unexpected
 
03:08:13.849 --> 03:08:13.859 align:start position:0%
correct correct another question
 
03:08:16.309 --> 03:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:08:16.319 --> 03:08:17.870 align:start position:0%
and uh
this

03:08:17.870 --> 03:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:08:20.450 --> 03:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
natural disaster
 
03:08:20.460 --> 03:08:21.830 align:start position:0%
natural disaster
is

03:08:21.830 --> 03:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:08:24.050 --> 03:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
we have all we have now we have many
 
03:08:27.050 --> 03:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
natural disasters and we take care of
 
03:08:29.150 --> 03:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
them now
 
03:08:33.110 --> 03:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh what makes what makes this different
 
03:08:36.290 --> 03:08:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:39.889 --> 03:08:39.899 align:start position:0%
well let me just leave it at that
 
03:08:43.250 --> 03:08:43.260 align:start position:0%
what I'm I don't mean to be deaf I don't
 
03:08:45.410 --> 03:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
understand what you're what you mean by
 
03:08:47.150 --> 03:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
using the word different I apologize
 
03:08:49.370 --> 03:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
well we have we have other net we have
 
03:08:51.610 --> 03:08:51.620 align:start position:0%
natural disasters we've had them since
 
03:08:55.429 --> 03:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
you know time immemorial and the state
 
03:09:00.190 --> 03:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
has been able to react to them in in as
 
03:09:03.950 --> 03:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
in a normal way and we we have we do
 
03:09:06.410 --> 03:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
react to natural disasters
 
03:09:06.420 --> 03:09:07.990 align:start position:0%
react to natural disasters
uh

03:09:07.990 --> 03:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:09:11.330 --> 03:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
why is all of a sudden
 
03:09:15.170 --> 03:09:15.180 align:start position:0%
this taken is a different what what is
 
03:09:18.050 --> 03:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
what it why is this uh of such
 
03:09:20.870 --> 03:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
importance that it can't be handled in
 
03:09:23.750 --> 03:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
the in the in the normal way we handle
 
03:09:26.030 --> 03:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
natural disasters in this state so the
 
03:09:28.670 --> 03:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
natural disasters and this is this is me
 
03:09:31.610 --> 03:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
my knowledge and if I'm wrong hold me in
 
03:09:31.620 --> 03:09:33.050 align:start position:0%
my knowledge and if I'm wrong hold me in
contempt

03:09:33.050 --> 03:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
contempt
 
03:09:33.060 --> 03:09:34.190 align:start position:0%
contempt
um

03:09:34.190 --> 03:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:37.490 --> 03:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
usually there is a federal disaster
 
03:09:40.309 --> 03:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
declaration that's made as it relates to
 
03:09:44.809 --> 03:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
the state so if if we were to take
 
03:09:47.630 --> 03:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
Hampton Beach in
 
03:09:50.750 --> 03:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
title surge in the title search totally
 
03:09:54.050 --> 03:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
you know flooding Hampton Beach and you
 
03:09:55.730 --> 03:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
you know for the most part Hampton beach
 
03:09:58.309 --> 03:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
is on a public water system there are in
 
03:10:00.230 --> 03:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
some select houses on along the beach
 
03:10:01.969 --> 03:10:01.979 align:start position:0%
that have a private well so let's let's
 
03:10:04.190 --> 03:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
assume those those Wells get tainted by
 
03:10:06.290 --> 03:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
the salt water that came over came over
 
03:10:08.929 --> 03:10:08.939 align:start position:0%
the wall and permeated those Wells
 
03:10:11.269 --> 03:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
I would presume not assume I would
 
03:10:13.490 --> 03:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
presume that the federal disaster
 
03:10:15.590 --> 03:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
declaration and that FEMA funds would be
 
03:10:18.230 --> 03:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
made available for that homeowner to be
 
03:10:21.110 --> 03:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
able to apply to be able to remediate
 
03:10:23.330 --> 03:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
that particular well because the well is
 
03:10:25.790 --> 03:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
now tainted with with salt water
 
03:10:31.309 --> 03:10:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:31.319 --> 03:10:32.870 align:start position:0%
 
droughts

03:10:32.870 --> 03:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
droughts
 
03:10:36.349 --> 03:10:36.359 align:start position:0%
as of today and I I I'm trying to go
 
03:10:38.510 --> 03:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
back and look at new sources as it
 
03:10:39.830 --> 03:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
relates to the droughts that are
 
03:10:41.330 --> 03:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
occurring are occurring out in the west
 
03:10:43.670 --> 03:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
like Arizona Wyoming Colorado California
 
03:10:47.210 --> 03:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
Nevada I am trying to remember if
 
03:10:49.150 --> 03:10:49.160 align:start position:0%
there's ever been a federal disaster
 
03:10:52.490 --> 03:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
declaration that that has been made as
 
03:10:55.070 --> 03:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
it relates to that kind of an event now
 
03:10:56.809 --> 03:10:56.819 align:start position:0%
I could be wrong but I don't I don't
 
03:11:00.950 --> 03:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
remember any so in looking at the
 
03:11:03.050 --> 03:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
drought situation here in New Hampshire
 
03:11:06.910 --> 03:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
which is classified as as a natural
 
03:11:10.190 --> 03:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
disaster without having that formal
 
03:11:12.950 --> 03:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
declaration we're leaving a segment of
 
03:11:15.650 --> 03:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
we're leaving a six segment of granite
 
03:11:18.710 --> 03:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
Staters that don't have that some may
 
03:11:20.870 --> 03:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
have the wherewithal to fix it but those
 
03:11:23.330 --> 03:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
that don't have their for the again for
 
03:11:24.290 --> 03:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
the lack of a better word they're
 
03:11:26.330 --> 03:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
probably left out on a Lurch without
 
03:11:28.790 --> 03:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
having any particular direction by
 
03:11:31.370 --> 03:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
having this specific program being
 
03:11:34.730 --> 03:11:34.740 align:start position:0%
administered enrolled under the guise of
 
03:11:37.490 --> 03:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
guys of Des and and I can say
 
03:11:39.410 --> 03:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
having watched them at work over the
 
03:11:41.269 --> 03:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
last three years and Minister the
 
03:11:43.309 --> 03:11:43.319 align:start position:0%
programs for the commission
 
03:11:45.530 --> 03:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
um the the the actual the the
 
03:11:47.630 --> 03:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
application process the attention to
 
03:11:50.150 --> 03:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
detail the use of the criteria the rule
 
03:11:52.790 --> 03:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
making I'm confident that that those
 
03:11:55.429 --> 03:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
specific processes would carry over
 
03:11:58.309 --> 03:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
should should this program be enacted
 
03:12:01.490 --> 03:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
and implemented into law I'm I'm fairly
 
03:12:03.830 --> 03:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable that Des has the the
 
03:12:05.210 --> 03:12:05.220 align:start position:0%
technical expertise in the
 
03:12:07.670 --> 03:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
professionalism to to administer the
 
03:12:10.370 --> 03:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
program so back to your original
 
03:12:11.750 --> 03:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
question I think there's a difference
 
03:12:13.610 --> 03:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
when when you don't have a federal
 
03:12:16.429 --> 03:12:16.439 align:start position:0%
Declaration of a natural disaster you're
 
03:12:17.450 --> 03:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
going to have a certain segment of
 
03:12:20.030 --> 03:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
society that's that's flounder and being
 
03:12:22.370 --> 03:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
able to provide them an Avenue of
 
03:12:24.650 --> 03:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
approach to hopefully fix or remediate
 
03:12:27.530 --> 03:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
that problem I think is is noteworthy
 
03:12:30.230 --> 03:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
and it's something that I personally
 
03:12:30.240 --> 03:12:31.730 align:start position:0%
and it's something that I personally
feel

03:12:31.730 --> 03:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
feel
 
03:12:33.530 --> 03:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
um we've had success with it and I
 
03:12:35.210 --> 03:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
really want to continue the program I
 
03:12:37.370 --> 03:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
think it's it's a good thing to have and
 
03:12:39.050 --> 03:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
I in our community in our community in
 
03:12:40.370 --> 03:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
our state
 
03:12:43.910 --> 03:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you is there anyone else wishes to
 
03:12:48.469 --> 03:12:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:51.170 --> 03:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:12:52.670 --> 03:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your testimony
 
03:12:54.769 --> 03:12:54.779 align:start position:0%
representative Boyd are you familiar
 
03:12:59.150 --> 03:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
with uh the agent that that's the United
 
03:13:01.429 --> 03:13:01.439 align:start position:0%
States Department of Agriculture Farm
 
03:13:04.849 --> 03:13:04.859 align:start position:0%
Service Agency has a disaster assistance
 
03:13:07.550 --> 03:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
program for Drought recovery and have
 
03:13:13.370 --> 03:13:13.380 align:start position:0%
you how does is that uh so the the
 
03:13:16.670 --> 03:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
DOA Department of agriculture's program
 
03:13:19.670 --> 03:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
is actually part of our criteria when
 
03:13:21.710 --> 03:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
we're looking at applications for some
 
03:13:23.990 --> 03:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
of the programs you know not just not
 
03:13:25.730 --> 03:13:25.740 align:start position:0%
the one program so this is done as an
 
03:13:25.740 --> 03:13:27.110 align:start position:0%
the one program so this is done as an
aside

03:13:27.110 --> 03:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
aside
 
03:13:28.670 --> 03:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
um to what the commission addresses in
 
03:13:31.790 --> 03:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
looking at criteria for how we make our
 
03:13:34.490 --> 03:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
grant Awards to municipalities that are
 
03:13:36.969 --> 03:13:36.979 align:start position:0%
doing Source water protection
 
03:13:39.710 --> 03:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
infrastructure you know Wellhead
 
03:13:42.469 --> 03:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
protection um actually buying up land to
 
03:13:44.389 --> 03:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
protect that so there are specific
 
03:13:45.950 --> 03:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
criteria that the Department of
 
03:13:47.990 --> 03:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
Agriculture has as it relates to that
 
03:13:50.450 --> 03:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
program now I've actually looked at the
 
03:13:52.849 --> 03:13:52.859 align:start position:0%
criteria to that particular program and
 
03:13:54.710 --> 03:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
I kind of look at that criteria more as
 
03:13:57.230 --> 03:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
a regional approach or a municipal
 
03:13:58.849 --> 03:13:58.859 align:start position:0%
approach to a problem as opposed to an
 
03:14:01.070 --> 03:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
individual homeowner approach now I
 
03:14:03.230 --> 03:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
could be wrong because I candidly I
 
03:14:05.630 --> 03:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
didn't get into the weeds in in looking
 
03:14:07.670 --> 03:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
at it fully but that was one of the
 
03:14:10.849 --> 03:14:10.859 align:start position:0%
things I did look at in preparation and
 
03:14:13.790 --> 03:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
prior to sponsoring this bill to see if
 
03:14:15.230 --> 03:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
there was
 
03:14:18.530 --> 03:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
um anything else available to homeowners
 
03:14:20.809 --> 03:14:20.819 align:start position:0%
or property owners that they can make
 
03:14:26.450 --> 03:14:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:30.290 --> 03:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:32.389 --> 03:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much Mr
 
03:14:33.950 --> 03:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
chairman three of my colleagues thank
 
03:14:36.650 --> 03:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:36.660 --> 03:14:40.809 align:start position:0%
 
perfect

03:14:40.809 --> 03:14:40.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:40.819 --> 03:14:42.429 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:14:42.429 --> 03:14:42.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:14:46.910 --> 03:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative Mary Hawkins Phillips
 
03:14:49.070 --> 03:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
they pronounce did I pronounced
 
03:14:54.830 --> 03:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:58.130 --> 03:14:58.140 align:start position:0%
I mean the Phillips yeah I'll be honest
 
03:14:59.690 --> 03:14:59.700 align:start position:0%
representative I couldn't hear from back
 
03:15:01.730 --> 03:15:01.740 align:start position:0%
here but um for the record my name is
 
03:15:03.950 --> 03:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
Mary hacken Phillips I represent Grafton
 
03:15:06.410 --> 03:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
County District 12. the towns of Hanover
 
03:15:09.530 --> 03:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
and lime thank you for the the time to
 
03:15:11.389 --> 03:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
address you today
 
03:15:16.550 --> 03:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:19.429 --> 03:15:19.439 align:start position:0%
so I'm here today speaking on as a
 
03:15:23.809 --> 03:15:23.819 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on behalf of HB 534 for four
 
03:15:27.230 --> 03:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
main reasons I support this bill
 
03:15:29.030 --> 03:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
first this past summer representative
 
03:15:30.650 --> 03:15:30.660 align:start position:0%
Boyd and I made a commitment to each
 
03:15:32.809 --> 03:15:32.819 align:start position:0%
other to find ways to work together
 
03:15:35.510 --> 03:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
across the aisle and we've made a point
 
03:15:37.610 --> 03:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
to find and support good legislation
 
03:15:39.769 --> 03:15:39.779 align:start position:0%
regardless of the party that introduces
 
03:15:39.779 --> 03:15:40.670 align:start position:0%
regardless of the party that introduces
it

03:15:40.670 --> 03:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:15:45.710 --> 03:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
today HB 534 represents good legislation
 
03:15:47.510 --> 03:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
um and as it's been introduced by my
 
03:15:48.950 --> 03:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
honorable colleague
 
03:15:51.710 --> 03:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
um representative Boyd I just
 
03:15:54.830 --> 03:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
hope and invite you all to consider you
 
03:15:56.990 --> 03:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
know the option to join in bipartisan
 
03:15:58.910 --> 03:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
ship today
 
03:16:01.550 --> 03:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
second it's my sincere hope that all
 
03:16:03.349 --> 03:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
legislators can agree that access to
 
03:16:05.750 --> 03:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
clean water is a necessity to a healthy
 
03:16:07.550 --> 03:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
and prosperous Granite State regardless
 
03:16:09.170 --> 03:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
of where you live
 
03:16:11.090 --> 03:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
an example of why I think this bill is
 
03:16:13.130 --> 03:16:13.140 align:start position:0%
so critical is that I have a constituent
 
03:16:15.710 --> 03:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
in the Aetna area who recently noticed
 
03:16:18.110 --> 03:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
their well was running dry and if you're
 
03:16:21.110 --> 03:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
not familiar with where Aetna is it's a
 
03:16:23.450 --> 03:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
small village just to the east of
 
03:16:27.469 --> 03:16:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:29.030 --> 03:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
um one December afternoon this
 
03:16:31.070 --> 03:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
constituent had run a couple of loads of
 
03:16:33.290 --> 03:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
laundry and ran their dishwasher and
 
03:16:36.170 --> 03:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
noticed at dinner time that their Taps
 
03:16:37.550 --> 03:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
started to run dry
 
03:16:39.590 --> 03:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
after Consulting with professionals they
 
03:16:41.210 --> 03:16:41.220 align:start position:0%
learned that their well was indeed
 
03:16:43.849 --> 03:16:43.859 align:start position:0%
running dry it's not refilling at a you
 
03:16:45.469 --> 03:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
know proper rate fast enough to keep
 
03:16:48.590 --> 03:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
Pace with their regular household needs
 
03:16:50.990 --> 03:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
so the reason they found out was a
 
03:16:52.790 --> 03:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
variety of some factors but it was
 
03:16:55.910 --> 03:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
exacerbated by the ongoing drought that
 
03:16:57.769 --> 03:16:57.779 align:start position:0%
the state is experiencing
 
03:17:00.410 --> 03:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
when they inquired as to how long it
 
03:17:01.790 --> 03:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
would take and how much money it would
 
03:17:03.530 --> 03:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
take to remedy the situation they
 
03:17:05.090 --> 03:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
learned it's going to take thousands of
 
03:17:07.130 --> 03:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
dollars to find a new well
 
03:17:09.469 --> 03:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
and it would take several weeks before a
 
03:17:11.990 --> 03:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
driller could come and process the
 
03:17:15.290 --> 03:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
location so you know thankfully this
 
03:17:17.870 --> 03:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
family has the resources to pay the
 
03:17:20.389 --> 03:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
premium price of Expediting that new L
 
03:17:23.210 --> 03:17:23.220 align:start position:0%
to be drilled in an emergency situation
 
03:17:25.309 --> 03:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
but we all know that not every family in
 
03:17:27.830 --> 03:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
the granite state has resources to pay
 
03:17:29.630 --> 03:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
for emergency Wells to be drilled on
 
03:17:31.730 --> 03:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
their property when they need it
 
03:17:33.530 --> 03:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
there's many families who are struggling
 
03:17:35.809 --> 03:17:35.819 align:start position:0%
to meet their day-to-day costs and their
 
03:17:37.969 --> 03:17:37.979 align:start position:0%
living paycheck to paycheck they don't
 
03:17:40.130 --> 03:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
have several thousand dollars to ensure
 
03:17:42.530 --> 03:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
that they have safe clean water at home
 
03:17:44.929 --> 03:17:44.939 align:start position:0%
these folks also deserve access to clean
 
03:17:47.690 --> 03:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
water just the same I think you'll agree
 
03:17:49.429 --> 03:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
many believe that clean water is an
 
03:17:51.530 --> 03:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
access uh clean water access is an
 
03:17:54.050 --> 03:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
equality issue and providing access to
 
03:17:55.490 --> 03:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
those who can't afford it is the right
 
03:17:57.650 --> 03:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
thing to do especially when you're faced
 
03:18:00.349 --> 03:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
with natural natural disasters
 
03:18:03.469 --> 03:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
you know my example is not the kind of
 
03:18:05.990 --> 03:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
natural disaster one might think of
 
03:18:08.030 --> 03:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
um you know more immediately like a
 
03:18:10.610 --> 03:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
tornado or an earthquake or a huge you
 
03:18:12.469 --> 03:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
know hundred year flood
 
03:18:14.570 --> 03:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
but the long-term drought conditions are
 
03:18:16.730 --> 03:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
making natural disaster scenarios very
 
03:18:19.070 --> 03:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
real for our state and what better cause
 
03:18:20.750 --> 03:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
than to support our most vulnerable
 
03:18:23.630 --> 03:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
citizens in securing clean water after a
 
03:18:25.670 --> 03:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
natural disaster
 
03:18:27.590 --> 03:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
the third reason I think about is that
 
03:18:28.910 --> 03:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
we all know our state is obviously
 
03:18:32.210 --> 03:18:32.220 align:start position:0%
experiencing this drought condition and
 
03:18:34.309 --> 03:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
we need to think about the true costs of
 
03:18:37.429 --> 03:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
the slow-moving phenomenon
 
03:18:40.490 --> 03:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
although in recent months our state has
 
03:18:42.650 --> 03:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
drought conditions have lessened the
 
03:18:44.269 --> 03:18:44.279 align:start position:0%
real dangers of long-term effects of
 
03:18:46.010 --> 03:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
this drought and future possible
 
03:18:48.650 --> 03:18:48.660 align:start position:0%
droughts is very real
 
03:18:51.410 --> 03:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
the cost of drought are not only related
 
03:18:53.330 --> 03:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
to the environment and natural resources
 
03:18:55.370 --> 03:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
there's a very real financial and
 
03:18:57.170 --> 03:18:57.180 align:start position:0%
economic concern that the state will
 
03:19:00.050 --> 03:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
face the short-term allocation included
 
03:19:03.590 --> 03:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
in this bill proposes a great start
 
03:19:05.510 --> 03:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to be preventing long-term
 
03:19:07.730 --> 03:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
more painful and higher material costs
 
03:19:09.830 --> 03:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
by the state when economically depressed
 
03:19:12.530 --> 03:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
rural areas lose access to clean water
 
03:19:15.230 --> 03:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
and are forced to migrate to areas with
 
03:19:17.210 --> 03:19:17.220 align:start position:0%
more access
 
03:19:19.190 --> 03:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
in other words it's going to cost more
 
03:19:20.809 --> 03:19:20.819 align:start position:0%
to move from you know out in the
 
03:19:22.849 --> 03:19:22.859 align:start position:0%
countryside with a private well into you
 
03:19:25.610 --> 03:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
know more infrastructure supported Urban
 
03:19:25.620 --> 03:19:27.530 align:start position:0%
know more infrastructure supported Urban
centers

03:19:27.530 --> 03:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
centers
 
03:19:29.269 --> 03:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just break down this
 
03:19:30.950 --> 03:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
argument it's far Cheaper to Keep people
 
03:19:33.290 --> 03:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
where they are longer than to support
 
03:19:35.690 --> 03:19:35.700 align:start position:0%
them in finding a new location as a
 
03:19:37.790 --> 03:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
state we should be prepared to deal with
 
03:19:37.800 --> 03:19:38.750 align:start position:0%
state we should be prepared to deal with
that

03:19:38.750 --> 03:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:19:40.910 --> 03:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
and these drought like conditions and
 
03:19:42.590 --> 03:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
the long term and this is a great way to
 
03:19:44.690 --> 03:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
to begin that process
 
03:19:47.090 --> 03:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
my fourth point is that this bill is one
 
03:19:50.269 --> 03:19:50.279 align:start position:0%
more piece of legislation to help solve
 
03:19:52.790 --> 03:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
our housing crisis which is plaguing our
 
03:19:52.800 --> 03:19:53.750 align:start position:0%
our housing crisis which is plaguing our
state

03:19:53.750 --> 03:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:19:55.610 --> 03:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
solving the housing crisis is a
 
03:19:55.620 --> 03:19:56.990 align:start position:0%
solving the housing crisis is a
multi-layered

03:19:56.990 --> 03:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
multi-layered
 
03:20:00.710 --> 03:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
you know multi-level effort and it's you
 
03:20:02.389 --> 03:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
know any small piece that you can add to
 
03:20:05.030 --> 03:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
the puzzle to keep vulnerable people in
 
03:20:06.710 --> 03:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
their homes should be undertaken giving
 
03:20:08.990 --> 03:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
our housing stock shortages
 
03:20:11.630 --> 03:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
imagine losing your well after a natural
 
03:20:14.450 --> 03:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
disaster and being forced to move with
 
03:20:16.130 --> 03:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
no place to go
 
03:20:18.050 --> 03:20:18.060 align:start position:0%
let's do our part Let's help increase
 
03:20:20.210 --> 03:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
well access so that our poorest
 
03:20:22.190 --> 03:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
community members only have to deal with
 
03:20:24.710 --> 03:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
one crisis at a time
 
03:20:26.690 --> 03:20:26.700 align:start position:0%
and some I'd like to urge you to join
 
03:20:28.910 --> 03:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
this bipartisan effort in support of
 
03:20:31.670 --> 03:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
this bill and give the legislation the
 
03:20:33.889 --> 03:20:33.899 align:start position:0%
Bridge Building ought to pass that it
 
03:20:36.290 --> 03:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
deserves trust me it feels good to reach
 
03:20:37.790 --> 03:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
across the aisle and support good
 
03:20:40.130 --> 03:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
legislation if it means Granite Staters
 
03:20:43.429 --> 03:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
will be their lives will be improved I'd
 
03:20:44.570 --> 03:20:44.580 align:start position:0%

03:20:57.110 --> 03:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:09.110 --> 03:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:12.490 --> 03:21:12.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:14.990 --> 03:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
yeah turn it on thank you good afternoon
 
03:21:17.450 --> 03:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and members of the committee uh
 
03:21:19.070 --> 03:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Bob Scott I'm
 
03:21:19.969 --> 03:21:19.979 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
03:21:21.590 --> 03:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services and
 
03:21:24.170 --> 03:21:24.180 align:start position:0%
I'm also a I serve on the drinking water
 
03:21:27.530 --> 03:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund and also
 
03:21:27.540 --> 03:21:28.190 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund and also
um

03:21:28.190 --> 03:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:30.530 --> 03:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
I do have some of my team are still here
 
03:21:32.389 --> 03:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
we've been in the audience all morning
 
03:21:35.870 --> 03:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh I have uh Dr Bondi as as
 
03:21:38.269 --> 03:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
uh representative Boyd mentioned she's
 
03:21:40.849 --> 03:21:40.859 align:start position:0%
the administrator of the the trust fund
 
03:21:42.230 --> 03:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
the drinking water groundwater trust
 
03:21:45.830 --> 03:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
fund uh and and uh we have director
 
03:21:48.650 --> 03:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
Pelletier is behind me also uh director
 
03:21:50.630 --> 03:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
of The Water Division which includes our
 
03:21:52.969 --> 03:21:52.979 align:start position:0%
drinking water program so our hope is if
 
03:21:55.130 --> 03:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
there's any questions we could certainly
 
03:21:57.650 --> 03:21:57.660 align:start position:0%
try to answer those for you so briefly
 
03:21:59.750 --> 03:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh as I pass out my the testimony
 
03:22:02.150 --> 03:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
letters going around uh as mentioned
 
03:22:04.630 --> 03:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
already this program it
 
03:22:07.790 --> 03:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
effectively exists already through the
 
03:22:09.950 --> 03:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
auspicious of the drinking water ground
 
03:22:13.429 --> 03:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
lawyer trust fund uh since 2021 we've
 
03:22:15.830 --> 03:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
we've this need for this needs-based
 
03:22:17.450 --> 03:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
program we've been able to provide
 
03:22:19.969 --> 03:22:19.979 align:start position:0%
assistance to about 147 private well
 
03:22:25.429 --> 03:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
owners uh since then uh the intent uh in
 
03:22:27.290 --> 03:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
my view for the trust fund it was not to
 
03:22:30.110 --> 03:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
be a permanent forever thing for the
 
03:22:31.550 --> 03:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
things that are funded out of the trust
 
03:22:35.150 --> 03:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
fund uh but meant to be you know we've
 
03:22:36.710 --> 03:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
as you're well aware probably we've done
 
03:22:38.690 --> 03:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
injections of money for infrastructure
 
03:22:41.210 --> 03:22:41.220 align:start position:0%
and other things this program we feel
 
03:22:44.030 --> 03:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
has been very successful but the intent
 
03:22:46.790 --> 03:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
was uh at this point since it seems to
 
03:22:48.530 --> 03:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
be something that's needed moving
 
03:22:51.170 --> 03:22:51.180 align:start position:0%
forward uh to codify it and also get
 
03:22:53.809 --> 03:22:53.819 align:start position:0%
obviously legislative support
 
03:22:56.210 --> 03:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
um so I briefly I can also answer some
 
03:22:58.309 --> 03:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
questions uh as mentioned I think we had
 
03:23:00.469 --> 03:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
a question about the current drought
 
03:23:03.469 --> 03:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
today we are not in a status state of
 
03:23:05.750 --> 03:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
drought for most of the state 8 whether
 
03:23:07.550 --> 03:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
we would be in the spring and again so
 
03:23:09.889 --> 03:23:09.899 align:start position:0%
far we've had three years of drought uh
 
03:23:11.870 --> 03:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
if the question is are we going into
 
03:23:14.150 --> 03:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
year four it really depends on the
 
03:23:16.070 --> 03:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
recharge the aquifers and the amount of
 
03:23:17.870 --> 03:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
snowpack now snowpack looks like it's
 
03:23:20.090 --> 03:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
getting better right now uh but we're
 
03:23:22.250 --> 03:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
not done with the winter yet so it's an
 
03:23:23.990 --> 03:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
open question whether we'll go into year
 
03:23:26.570 --> 03:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
four I will tell you that in the past
 
03:23:28.370 --> 03:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
three years we've been in severe drought
 
03:23:31.010 --> 03:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
in different parts of the State uh and
 
03:23:32.510 --> 03:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
then answer the question is this just a
 
03:23:34.070 --> 03:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
Merrimack thing actually it's not been
 
03:23:36.110 --> 03:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
much of a Merrimack thing it's it's been
 
03:23:39.050 --> 03:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
wherever the most severe drought is uh
 
03:23:40.550 --> 03:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
in the past three years so it's been
 
03:23:42.349 --> 03:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
more the North country in the past years
 
03:23:45.290 --> 03:23:45.300 align:start position:0%
this last year in 2022 it was mostly in
 
03:23:46.790 --> 03:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
the Southern Tier where most of the
 
03:23:49.429 --> 03:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
population is also
 
03:23:54.229 --> 03:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:55.670 --> 03:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
I had some other thoughts but I can't
 
03:23:56.990 --> 03:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
remember what they were
 
03:23:59.389 --> 03:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
um so the other thing I will mention uh
 
03:24:01.070 --> 03:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
certainly we support the program we
 
03:24:02.990 --> 03:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
think is very needed the other question
 
03:24:06.349 --> 03:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
I think was uh some questions on what
 
03:24:07.849 --> 03:24:07.859 align:start position:0%
other things other than drought is it
 
03:24:09.530 --> 03:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
used for I'll give you a great example
 
03:24:12.290 --> 03:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
which will answer two things as far as
 
03:24:14.510 --> 03:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
need and and I think the chair had asked
 
03:24:16.670 --> 03:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
is there you know can't I think
 
03:24:18.349 --> 03:24:18.359 align:start position:0%
effectively doesn't FEMA take care of
 
03:24:20.030 --> 03:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
this type of thing and you know are
 
03:24:22.550 --> 03:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
there other resources so if you go back
 
03:24:26.030 --> 03:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh prior to covid we had a flooding
 
03:24:27.590 --> 03:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
event on the baker River I don't know if
 
03:24:29.330 --> 03:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
some of you remember that where we had a
 
03:24:31.370 --> 03:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
house going down channel nine on on
 
03:24:32.750 --> 03:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
Channel Nine a house going down the
 
03:24:36.170 --> 03:24:36.180 align:start position:0%
river in Warner Warren rather
 
03:24:38.750 --> 03:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
um that that scouring of that River
 
03:24:41.330 --> 03:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
caused by that event actually lowered
 
03:24:44.150 --> 03:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
the water table for some wells in that
 
03:24:47.570 --> 03:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
local community uh that wasn't really
 
03:24:49.250 --> 03:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
funds available for those private Wells
 
03:24:51.950 --> 03:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
if some of you may remember at the time
 
03:24:54.170 --> 03:24:54.180 align:start position:0%
Senator gaida he did a GoFundMe page so
 
03:24:58.070 --> 03:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
help people the director of sem at the
 
03:25:00.650 --> 03:25:00.660 align:start position:0%
time was able to they had small amounts
 
03:25:02.330 --> 03:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
of money but not nearly enough to cover
 
03:25:04.370 --> 03:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
people for the wells being drilled that
 
03:25:06.530 --> 03:25:06.540 align:start position:0%
were needed that's it the type of thing
 
03:25:08.210 --> 03:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
where it's not necessarily covered by
 
03:25:10.910 --> 03:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
FEMA and it's not necessarily drought
 
03:25:12.469 --> 03:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
related but those are that's an example
 
03:25:13.969 --> 03:25:13.979 align:start position:0%
real world example in New Hampshire
 
03:25:15.889 --> 03:25:15.899 align:start position:0%
where this this program could have
 
03:25:17.389 --> 03:25:17.399 align:start position:0%
provided that kind of assistance because
 
03:25:20.210 --> 03:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
those were low-income residents as I
 
03:25:22.610 --> 03:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
remember so so with that my last
 
03:25:24.229 --> 03:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
statement would be we strongly support
 
03:25:26.469 --> 03:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
the program it's a it's a viable program
 
03:25:29.809 --> 03:25:29.819 align:start position:0%
uh this this legislation would give us
 
03:25:31.610 --> 03:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
authority to do rule making so there'd
 
03:25:33.290 --> 03:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
be a whole public process there on what
 
03:25:36.050 --> 03:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
we should do we do intent to to should
 
03:25:39.610 --> 03:25:39.620 align:start position:0%
this pass to uh have the the rule making
 
03:25:41.809 --> 03:25:41.819 align:start position:0%
uh very closely mirror what we're
 
03:25:42.950 --> 03:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
currently doing
 
03:25:46.309 --> 03:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh and my last Point uh and as much as
 
03:25:48.650 --> 03:25:48.660 align:start position:0%
we love the program uh you'll note in my
 
03:25:49.969 --> 03:25:49.979 align:start position:0%
testimony letter we're not taking a
 
03:25:52.250 --> 03:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
position on the source of funding uh
 
03:25:54.469 --> 03:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
we're well aware there's multiple
 
03:25:56.510 --> 03:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
competing interests for funding right
 
03:26:00.170 --> 03:26:00.180 align:start position:0%
now uh I will assure you that with this
 
03:26:02.090 --> 03:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
bill and other bills that are for the
 
03:26:02.100 --> 03:26:03.290 align:start position:0%
bill and other bills that are for the
funding

03:26:03.290 --> 03:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
funding
 
03:26:06.170 --> 03:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
um that we we have and will if if we're
 
03:26:09.349 --> 03:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
the agency does get the money uh spend
 
03:26:11.870 --> 03:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
it very effectively and uh make it go as
 
03:26:14.090 --> 03:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
far as possible so with that I'm happy
 
03:26:15.650 --> 03:26:15.660 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions and again I have
 
03:26:17.389 --> 03:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
people smarter than me behind me that
 
03:26:20.690 --> 03:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:23.870 --> 03:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh as representative
 
03:26:25.729 --> 03:26:25.739 align:start position:0%
uh wrong
 
03:26:27.950 --> 03:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
03:26:29.870 --> 03:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner for coming
 
03:26:31.670 --> 03:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
um following up on a question I asked
 
03:26:35.090 --> 03:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
representative Boyd regarding the um uh
 
03:26:36.469 --> 03:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
03:26:41.570 --> 03:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
is is that just a a typo error on the
 
03:26:43.610 --> 03:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
behalf of Des it would be to replace
 
03:26:45.950 --> 03:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
drinking water sources not drinking
 
03:26:47.990 --> 03:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
water treatment sources
 
03:26:49.969 --> 03:26:49.979 align:start position:0%
that's correct so the intent of the
 
03:26:52.190 --> 03:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
program and the way we've administered
 
03:26:54.469 --> 03:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
it so far through the trust fund is if
 
03:26:57.710 --> 03:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
there's a permanent impact to make the
 
03:27:00.469 --> 03:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
well either dry or just unpotable water
 
03:27:03.590 --> 03:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
that and you have the the the income
 
03:27:05.450 --> 03:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
qualifications that would be the
 
03:27:07.250 --> 03:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
qualification so it doesn't need to be
 
03:27:09.590 --> 03:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
just for treatment uh so so I agree
 
03:27:11.210 --> 03:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
that's the drafting error for our fiscal
 
03:27:13.490 --> 03:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:27:13.500 --> 03:27:15.410 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
okay

03:27:15.410 --> 03:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:27:17.450 --> 03:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
any other questions members of the
 
03:27:17.460 --> 03:27:19.849 align:start position:0%
any other questions members of the
committee

03:27:19.849 --> 03:27:19.859 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:27:21.830 --> 03:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
representing Darby
 
03:27:23.750 --> 03:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
I think you missed the chair
 
03:27:25.190 --> 03:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to understand the numbers
 
03:27:28.370 --> 03:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
here so you've spent it seems like this
 
03:27:30.650 --> 03:27:30.660 align:start position:0%
is the ideas is the continuation of a
 
03:27:33.769 --> 03:27:33.779 align:start position:0%
program that has spent 2.5 million since
 
03:27:36.650 --> 03:27:36.660 align:start position:0%
2021 that's like 1.25 per year and this
 
03:27:38.870 --> 03:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
is doubling it up as at least as far as
 
03:27:40.670 --> 03:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
I see so
 
03:27:42.590 --> 03:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
um can you explain the justification for
 
03:27:44.450 --> 03:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
the doubling of fundsa
 
03:27:46.309 --> 03:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
certainly there is obviously the
 
03:27:48.290 --> 03:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
existing need moving forward which is
 
03:27:50.990 --> 03:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
notional right so for instance we of of
 
03:27:53.030 --> 03:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
late we've been spending the funds for
 
03:27:55.729 --> 03:27:55.739 align:start position:0%
Drought impacts and as I mentioned we're
 
03:27:57.110 --> 03:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
not sure what's going to happen in the
 
03:27:58.849 --> 03:27:58.859 align:start position:0%
future the other part of this program
 
03:28:01.309 --> 03:28:01.319 align:start position:0%
again is as mentioned it's not just for
 
03:28:04.250 --> 03:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
droughts for you know natural disasters
 
03:28:07.010 --> 03:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
and those are hard to predict uh so
 
03:28:09.410 --> 03:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
Summits the other rationale I guess is
 
03:28:11.990 --> 03:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
if we're on this if we worst case we're
 
03:28:13.969 --> 03:28:13.979 align:start position:0%
on the same trajectory for for droughts
 
03:28:16.790 --> 03:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
we we understand our spending trajectory
 
03:28:20.269 --> 03:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
but also we want a reserve if you will
 
03:28:22.910 --> 03:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
for those again uh there's an earthquake
 
03:28:25.490 --> 03:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
as as uh representative Boyd mentioned
 
03:28:29.349 --> 03:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
or a major hurricane uh puts you know
 
03:28:31.969 --> 03:28:31.979 align:start position:0%
put salt in you know some of the
 
03:28:34.309 --> 03:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
aquifers and the Seacoast I'm not hoping
 
03:28:37.429 --> 03:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
for any of this obviously uh but so so
 
03:28:40.130 --> 03:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
we we do want to be able to to have a a
 
03:28:42.229 --> 03:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
a amount of money there to be able to
 
03:28:45.290 --> 03:28:45.300 align:start position:0%
react quickly obviously if beyond that
 
03:28:47.030 --> 03:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully FEMA and others will step in
 
03:28:48.410 --> 03:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
and perhaps there'll be time for the
 
03:28:50.150 --> 03:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
legislature to step in but we really
 
03:28:53.389 --> 03:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
want this program to be the a place to
 
03:28:55.670 --> 03:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
go so they and having it within the
 
03:28:58.130 --> 03:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
department not requiring a vote of you
 
03:28:59.389 --> 03:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
know the trust fund or that type of
 
03:29:02.330 --> 03:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
thing where we can't act very agilely in
 
03:29:04.670 --> 03:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
an agile way so
 
03:29:06.530 --> 03:29:06.540 align:start position:0%
um it's not necessarily hopefully we'll
 
03:29:08.630 --> 03:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
never use the money to be to be blunt
 
03:29:10.070 --> 03:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
but the money we would like the money to
 
03:29:12.229 --> 03:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
be there for those instances should that
 
03:29:12.239 --> 03:29:13.070 align:start position:0%
be there for those instances should that
happen

03:29:13.070 --> 03:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
happen
 
03:29:16.910 --> 03:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:23.110 --> 03:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:25.269 --> 03:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:29:28.309 --> 03:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and I was wondering
 
03:29:30.950 --> 03:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
if there are other uh I know there are
 
03:29:32.870 --> 03:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
other home assistance programs in New
 
03:29:34.309 --> 03:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire government home assistance
 
03:29:37.250 --> 03:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
programs and and how those May overlap
 
03:29:38.809 --> 03:29:38.819 align:start position:0%
with this one
 
03:29:41.570 --> 03:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
can people apply for funds to other New
 
03:29:44.990 --> 03:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire home assistance programs for
 
03:29:47.870 --> 03:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
the same thing thank you
 
03:29:51.950 --> 03:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
I'm uh not as expert in this uh I I will
 
03:29:53.510 --> 03:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
say like you know and again I'll try to
 
03:29:54.830 --> 03:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
answer questions that were asked in the
 
03:29:56.389 --> 03:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
past too so you know the insurance
 
03:29:58.790 --> 03:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
question for instance I'd have two
 
03:30:00.590 --> 03:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
comments many insurance policies do not
 
03:30:03.530 --> 03:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
talk about Force Major and and sometimes
 
03:30:06.170 --> 03:30:06.180 align:start position:0%
you know a natural disaster would be
 
03:30:09.469 --> 03:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
that and second of all uh again we're
 
03:30:13.550 --> 03:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
looking at uh income need here and and
 
03:30:13.560 --> 03:30:14.630 align:start position:0%
looking at uh income need here and and
uh

03:30:14.630 --> 03:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:30:16.729 --> 03:30:16.739 align:start position:0%
those people are least likely to be able
 
03:30:18.309 --> 03:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
to pay for insurance or have insurance
 
03:30:21.290 --> 03:30:21.300 align:start position:0%
uh so so I I didn't answer your question
 
03:30:23.030 --> 03:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative but I'm not I guess I'm
 
03:30:24.349 --> 03:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
not sure I don't know if any of my staff
 
03:30:26.570 --> 03:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
have any other thoughts behind me if the
 
03:30:28.550 --> 03:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
chair would indulge
 
03:30:31.490 --> 03:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
so yes
 
03:30:33.830 --> 03:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
everybody okay
 
03:30:36.050 --> 03:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
03:30:39.590 --> 03:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
you could have two friends in the booth
 
03:30:45.290 --> 03:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:47.870 --> 03:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
hi thank you I'm Cheryl Bondi from Des
 
03:30:49.610 --> 03:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
and could you please repeat your
 
03:30:49.620 --> 03:30:50.690 align:start position:0%
and could you please repeat your
question

03:30:50.690 --> 03:30:50.700 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:30:50.700 --> 03:30:52.849 align:start position:0%
question
bye

03:30:52.849 --> 03:30:52.859 align:start position:0%
bye
 
03:30:55.370 --> 03:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
that's it um I was just one I know there
 
03:30:57.590 --> 03:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
are other New Hampshire Home assistants
 
03:31:00.849 --> 03:31:00.859 align:start position:0%
programs grants uh for low-income
 
03:31:04.370 --> 03:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
homeowners to receive uh to many to
 
03:31:04.380 --> 03:31:05.269 align:start position:0%
homeowners to receive uh to many to
mitigate

03:31:05.269 --> 03:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
mitigate
 
03:31:07.729 --> 03:31:07.739 align:start position:0%
problems in their homes so I was
 
03:31:09.889 --> 03:31:09.899 align:start position:0%
obviously the programs will overlap so
 
03:31:12.349 --> 03:31:12.359 align:start position:0%
you could address that thanks as far as
 
03:31:14.330 --> 03:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
I'm aware there are no other funding
 
03:31:15.950 --> 03:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
programs available for private well
 
03:31:17.389 --> 03:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
assistance so the drinking water
 
03:31:19.729 --> 03:31:19.739 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund has other funding
 
03:31:23.030 --> 03:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
programs for uh Community water systems
 
03:31:25.309 --> 03:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
and Municipal systems so through through
 
03:31:28.849 --> 03:31:28.859 align:start position:0%
that funding source there is no
 
03:31:28.859 --> 03:31:30.769 align:start position:0%
that funding source there is no
overlapping

03:31:30.769 --> 03:31:30.779 align:start position:0%
overlapping
 
03:31:30.779 --> 03:31:31.790 align:start position:0%
overlapping
um

03:31:31.790 --> 03:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:34.790 --> 03:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned the USDA Rural
 
03:31:38.030 --> 03:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
programs as far as I know folks that
 
03:31:41.330 --> 03:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
apply to this program the water systems
 
03:31:42.889 --> 03:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
for natural disasters they have already
 
03:31:45.650 --> 03:31:45.660 align:start position:0%
exhausted outside
 
03:31:48.050 --> 03:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
um options of funding and they have to
 
03:31:50.030 --> 03:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
show that they've uh that their home
 
03:31:52.729 --> 03:31:52.739 align:start position:0%
insurance doesn't cover it so they're
 
03:31:54.769 --> 03:31:54.779 align:start position:0%
they're coming to us as a last resort
 
03:31:56.210 --> 03:31:56.220 align:start position:0%
they've already exhausted outside
 
03:31:58.849 --> 03:31:58.859 align:start position:0%
options if they exist are available to
 
03:31:58.859 --> 03:32:05.030 align:start position:0%
options if they exist are available to
them

03:32:05.030 --> 03:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:08.210 --> 03:32:08.220 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
 
03:32:09.769 --> 03:32:09.779 align:start position:0%
seeing no one
 
03:32:11.630 --> 03:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:32:11.640 --> 03:32:14.389 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
finals

03:32:14.389 --> 03:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
finals
 
03:32:18.229 --> 03:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh Mr graze
 
03:32:20.870 --> 03:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
03:32:23.030 --> 03:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm well aware that
 
03:32:25.070 --> 03:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
I'm probably the person keeping all of
 
03:32:27.530 --> 03:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
you from lunch so I will be very brief
 
03:32:29.210 --> 03:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
um I've been very fortunate today to go
 
03:32:32.229 --> 03:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
it's me to go
 
03:32:34.670 --> 03:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
well I have been very fortunate today to
 
03:32:36.530 --> 03:32:36.540 align:start position:0%
go after uh des and I've been in
 
03:32:39.290 --> 03:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
agreement with their positions uh the
 
03:32:40.729 --> 03:32:40.739 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association does
 
03:32:43.370 --> 03:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
support this bill we view this as a
 
03:32:45.710 --> 03:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
forward forward thinking piece of
 
03:32:45.720 --> 03:32:47.450 align:start position:0%
forward forward thinking piece of
legislation

03:32:47.450 --> 03:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
03:32:50.030 --> 03:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
um and really it's over the past few
 
03:32:51.710 --> 03:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
years we've had a number of different
 
03:32:53.830 --> 03:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
natural disasters strike our our state
 
03:32:56.750 --> 03:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
so if I can just bring your mind back to
 
03:33:00.170 --> 03:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
July of 2021 there was a pretty severe
 
03:33:02.570 --> 03:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
rainstorm that impacted the Southwest
 
03:33:04.610 --> 03:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
part of the state
 
03:33:06.650 --> 03:33:06.660 align:start position:0%
um and in response to that
 
03:33:09.110 --> 03:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
um of course the people of the towns
 
03:33:10.969 --> 03:33:10.979 align:start position:0%
called their local officials and asked
 
03:33:12.769 --> 03:33:12.779 align:start position:0%
for help asked for
 
03:33:15.050 --> 03:33:15.060 align:start position:0%
um you know what do we do next and local
 
03:33:16.729 --> 03:33:16.739 align:start position:0%
officials turn around and called the
 
03:33:16.739 --> 03:33:17.990 align:start position:0%
officials turn around and called the
state

03:33:17.990 --> 03:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:33:21.469 --> 03:33:21.479 align:start position:0%
um and us and uh in response to some of
 
03:33:23.150 --> 03:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
those natural disasters there's there's
 
03:33:25.309 --> 03:33:25.319 align:start position:0%
legislation introduced last year
 
03:33:27.950 --> 03:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
and passed last year by the legislature
 
03:33:30.950 --> 03:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
to help address future uh natural
 
03:33:32.929 --> 03:33:32.939 align:start position:0%
disasters and what the state could do
 
03:33:34.849 --> 03:33:34.859 align:start position:0%
giving the state greater flexibility in
 
03:33:38.269 --> 03:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
in helping respond because we all know
 
03:33:39.769 --> 03:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
that the federal government is not
 
03:33:42.290 --> 03:33:42.300 align:start position:0%
always the fastest in responding and
 
03:33:44.450 --> 03:33:44.460 align:start position:0%
people need help now
 
03:33:46.690 --> 03:33:46.700 align:start position:0%
um and so we're very grateful for that
 
03:33:49.490 --> 03:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
and this kind of runs along the same
 
03:33:51.830 --> 03:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
lines where there's a hole in our
 
03:33:53.990 --> 03:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
current system where natural disasters
 
03:33:55.130 --> 03:33:55.140 align:start position:0%
may occur
 
03:33:57.229 --> 03:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
there are people who will be in need and
 
03:34:00.229 --> 03:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
there do not appear to be other programs
 
03:34:03.229 --> 03:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
um outside of whatever local assistance
 
03:34:05.870 --> 03:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
that that towns could provide
 
03:34:08.150 --> 03:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
um that would actually fill this hole
 
03:34:10.010 --> 03:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
and so we are hopeful that that the
 
03:34:11.269 --> 03:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
legislature will support this
 
03:34:14.450 --> 03:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
legislation to give the appropriate
 
03:34:16.370 --> 03:34:16.380 align:start position:0%
state agency greater flexibility and
 
03:34:17.870 --> 03:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
some funds to deal with this in the
 
03:34:17.880 --> 03:34:18.830 align:start position:0%
some funds to deal with this in the
future

03:34:18.830 --> 03:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
future
 
03:34:21.410 --> 03:34:21.420 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions
 
03:34:23.630 --> 03:34:23.640 align:start position:0%
any questions my members of the
 
03:34:23.640 --> 03:34:25.910 align:start position:0%
any questions my members of the
committee

03:34:25.910 --> 03:34:25.920 align:start position:0%

seeing no one
 
03:34:30.650 --> 03:34:30.660 align:start position:0%

04:10:55.859 --> 04:10:58.929 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:10:58.929 --> 04:10:58.939 align:start position:0%

04:11:06.050 --> 04:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
we just got finished with the one
 
04:11:10.070 --> 04:11:10.080 align:start position:0%

house bill 472 relative to the placement
 
04:11:17.269 --> 04:11:17.279 align:start position:0%

04:11:32.210 --> 04:11:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:34.849 --> 04:11:34.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:11:36.729 --> 04:11:36.739 align:start position:0%

um Madison it is a new it is a new
 
04:11:52.510 --> 04:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
District I bring before I use house bill
 
04:11:56.269 --> 04:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
472. it was never my intention to
 
04:11:56.279 --> 04:11:58.510 align:start position:0%
472. it was never my intention to
um

04:11:58.510 --> 04:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:03.170 --> 04:12:03.180 align:start position:0%
have permanent docs eliminated it's my
 
04:12:06.650 --> 04:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
intention from constituents to give more
 
04:12:09.790 --> 04:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
oversight for temporary docs on the lake
 
04:12:13.010 --> 04:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
I don't live on Lake Winnipesaukee but I
 
04:12:14.590 --> 04:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
have a lot of
 
04:12:18.110 --> 04:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
constituents that do and I was contacted
 
04:12:20.689 --> 04:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
about a temporary doc that was being
 
04:12:24.050 --> 04:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
placed near a loon nesting Center and
 
04:12:26.689 --> 04:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
when they notified d-e-s-d-e-s said they
 
04:12:28.790 --> 04:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
really had no control over that because
 
04:12:32.630 --> 04:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
they have no permitting and so when they
 
04:12:35.150 --> 04:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
contacted me and I read what temporary
 
04:12:35.160 --> 04:12:36.950 align:start position:0%
contacted me and I read what temporary
Docs

04:12:36.950 --> 04:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
Docs
 
04:12:40.250 --> 04:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
criteria was I thought well I think
 
04:12:42.349 --> 04:12:42.359 align:start position:0%
maybe Des needs a little more control
 
04:12:45.469 --> 04:12:45.479 align:start position:0%
over that and I probably would have to
 
04:12:47.389 --> 04:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
amend this because I've been told that
 
04:12:51.650 --> 04:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
it's pretty Broad and if I could say
 
04:12:53.150 --> 04:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
that I
 
04:12:56.389 --> 04:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
might take out Wildlife species because
 
04:12:59.090 --> 04:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
that certainly is a lot to
 
04:13:02.030 --> 04:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
cover and threatening species or
 
04:13:05.170 --> 04:13:05.180 align:start position:0%
endangered species might be more
 
04:13:07.670 --> 04:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate but I guess I would look to
 
04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
this committee to give me some guidance
 
04:13:14.510 --> 04:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
or to Des or a fishing game maybe and
 
04:13:18.469 --> 04:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
come to some type of a compromise
 
04:13:20.870 --> 04:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm certainly not an expert on
 
04:13:24.530 --> 04:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:26.689 --> 04:13:26.699 align:start position:0%
and that's my testimony which is
 
04:13:29.510 --> 04:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
testimony any questions any questions by
 
04:13:34.610 --> 04:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:34.620 --> 04:13:36.429 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:13:36.429 --> 04:13:36.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:13:40.550 --> 04:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh actually oh
 
04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh yep all right representative Darby
 
04:13:46.250 --> 04:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
Berg thank you Mr chairman um thank you
 
04:13:48.590 --> 04:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question yes I I think the
 
04:13:51.410 --> 04:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
term uh explicitly
 
04:13:53.750 --> 04:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
um any Wildlife species that phrase
 
04:13:55.429 --> 04:13:55.439 align:start position:0%
needs to be struck
 
04:13:59.150 --> 04:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
um and uh the the RSA that it refers to
 
04:14:02.030 --> 04:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
is about threatening while uh threatened
 
04:14:04.550 --> 04:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
endangered wildlife and loons as far as
 
04:14:06.170 --> 04:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
common loons as far as I understand in
 
04:14:09.769 --> 04:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
the in uh New Hampshire are threatened
 
04:14:11.510 --> 04:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
and so they would they would qualify
 
04:14:15.229 --> 04:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:18.790 --> 04:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
actually someone just walked in
 
04:14:22.670 --> 04:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
I am certain knows
 
04:14:26.210 --> 04:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
all about docs and was part of the
 
04:14:27.950 --> 04:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
committee that a part of a commission
 
04:14:27.960 --> 04:14:28.910 align:start position:0%
committee that a part of a commission
that

04:14:28.910 --> 04:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:28.920 --> 04:14:30.490 align:start position:0%
that
uh

04:14:30.490 --> 04:14:30.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:14:35.389 --> 04:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
we he and I and chaired by uh
 
04:14:35.399 --> 04:14:36.550 align:start position:0%
we he and I and chaired by uh
uh

04:14:36.550 --> 04:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:14:38.769 --> 04:14:38.779 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
04:14:42.469 --> 04:14:42.479 align:start position:0%
I forgot his name now but anyway the uh
 
04:14:47.929 --> 04:14:47.939 align:start position:0%
on on temporary Docs and you your your
 
04:14:53.090 --> 04:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
issue again is that uh there is whereas
 
04:14:54.769 --> 04:14:54.779 align:start position:0%
there were
 
04:14:58.370 --> 04:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
uh the emperor there were a loons near a
 
04:15:01.790 --> 04:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
temporary dock yes and uh
 
04:15:03.769 --> 04:15:03.779 align:start position:0%
I hate to hit you with it from out of
 
04:15:06.650 --> 04:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
nowhere uh running do you but uh
 
04:15:08.870 --> 04:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
when you have a protected species you're
 
04:15:12.170 --> 04:15:12.180 align:start position:0%
a temporary dock do we cover that during
 
04:15:12.180 --> 04:15:13.729 align:start position:0%
a temporary dock do we cover that during
our

04:15:13.729 --> 04:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:15:16.550 --> 04:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
that Commission
 
04:15:20.750 --> 04:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
we did not cover that okay thank you but
 
04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
uh can you recall whether they're uh uh
 
04:15:27.349 --> 04:15:27.359 align:start position:0%
that is was I think representative Darby
 
04:15:30.650 --> 04:15:30.660 align:start position:0%
said that uh because the the loons are a
 
04:15:33.170 --> 04:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
prospective species that
 
04:15:37.309 --> 04:15:37.319 align:start position:0%
they are they are protected or
 
04:15:40.309 --> 04:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
you know from from a from a temporary
 
04:15:42.830 --> 04:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
Dock and even though they're they're no
 
04:15:45.530 --> 04:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
longer under permit they still could be
 
04:15:49.610 --> 04:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
affected by the uh by the law
 
04:15:54.349 --> 04:15:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:56.210 --> 04:15:56.220 align:start position:0%
oh that might help that might help you
 
04:15:59.570 --> 04:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
but right but uh anyway well let's
 
04:16:02.030 --> 04:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
continue with the with the process I'm

sorry uh that's quite all right thank
 
04:16:06.710 --> 04:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman it could be a little bit
 
04:16:09.410 --> 04:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
I could be a little bit helpful uh any
 
04:16:11.330 --> 04:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
other questions uh by members of the
 
04:16:11.340 --> 04:16:14.210 align:start position:0%
other questions uh by members of the
committee

04:16:14.210 --> 04:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:16.790 --> 04:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
Zena thank you very much
 
04:16:16.800 --> 04:16:19.550 align:start position:0%
Zena thank you very much

uh
 
04:16:22.550 --> 04:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
in opposition uh Chris Norwood for uh
 
04:16:28.429 --> 04:16:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:28.439 --> 04:16:31.729 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:16:31.729 --> 04:16:31.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:33.530 --> 04:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
04:16:33.540 --> 04:16:34.610 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
committee

04:16:34.610 --> 04:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:16:37.070 --> 04:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
um I think that uh what representative
 
04:16:39.110 --> 04:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
said in her opening testimony is really
 
04:16:41.090 --> 04:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
where I want to hit upon which is the
 
04:16:42.889 --> 04:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
lack of clarity
 
04:16:45.349 --> 04:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
um so I appreciate the comments that
 
04:16:47.689 --> 04:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
were already made relative to all
 
04:16:50.689 --> 04:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
Wildlife species but where I would
 
04:16:52.429 --> 04:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
specifically like to address the
 
04:16:55.010 --> 04:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
committee's attention is
 
04:16:55.020 --> 04:16:55.670 align:start position:0%
committee's attention is
um

04:16:55.670 --> 04:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:58.309 --> 04:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
what are the impacts for the property
 
04:17:01.849 --> 04:17:01.859 align:start position:0%
owner so uh I should apologize my name
 
04:17:04.370 --> 04:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
is Chris Norwood and I am the 2023 chair
 
04:17:06.349 --> 04:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Association of
 
04:17:09.349 --> 04:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
Realtors public policy committee and we
 
04:17:11.450 --> 04:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
are in opposition to this bill
 
04:17:14.870 --> 04:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
and we're certainly not in opposition to
 
04:17:17.150 --> 04:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
wanting to put a seasonal dock on top of
 
04:17:20.570 --> 04:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
a loon's nest but that is something we
 
04:17:23.030 --> 04:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
do not want to see where we have
 
04:17:25.729 --> 04:17:25.739 align:start position:0%
concerns is if you look at all of the
 
04:17:30.050 --> 04:17:30.060 align:start position:0%
other stipulations within the um
 
04:17:30.060 --> 04:17:31.910 align:start position:0%
other stipulations within the um
uh

04:17:31.910 --> 04:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
within the bill excuse me
 
04:17:37.130 --> 04:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
I can't find the piece of paper
 
04:17:38.990 --> 04:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
when you look into all the permitting
 
04:17:43.070 --> 04:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
under RSA 482 the vast majority of those
 
04:17:46.309 --> 04:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
letters those numbers 1 through 10 are
 
04:17:48.469 --> 04:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
something that you could do as a
 
04:17:51.469 --> 04:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
layperson as a property owner but we're
 
04:17:54.469 --> 04:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
unsure if this new piece of legislation
 
04:17:58.070 --> 04:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
would trigger a survey and who
 
04:17:59.809 --> 04:17:59.819 align:start position:0%
ultimately would conduct that survey
 
04:18:01.490 --> 04:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
would it be conducted by the Department
 
04:18:04.189 --> 04:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services which is my
 
04:18:05.750 --> 04:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
understanding they have jurisdiction
 
04:18:10.309 --> 04:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
over seasonal docs or by going into RSA
 
04:18:13.130 --> 04:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
212 which deals with endangered species
 
04:18:15.290 --> 04:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
that becomes more of a fish and game
 
04:18:17.450 --> 04:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction is this something that
 
04:18:20.210 --> 04:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
could be done administratively over the
 
04:18:22.370 --> 04:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
computer whereby there's a survey of
 
04:18:24.830 --> 04:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
maps that showcase where these
 
04:18:27.410 --> 04:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
endangered species would be or is this
 
04:18:30.110 --> 04:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
something rather that you would need to
 
04:18:32.269 --> 04:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
hire a professional that would need to
 
04:18:34.490 --> 04:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
come to your property and to conduct
 
04:18:35.990 --> 04:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
that survey
 
04:18:38.750 --> 04:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
and again the concern being that the
 
04:18:40.969 --> 04:18:40.979 align:start position:0%
majority of these items here you know
 
04:18:43.189 --> 04:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
distance from your neighbor Etc are
 
04:18:46.250 --> 04:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
things that a layperson could do so that
 
04:18:48.469 --> 04:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
was one concern and then the other
 
04:18:50.510 --> 04:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
concern is this in general the word
 
04:18:53.870 --> 04:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
impact itself again we do not want to
 
04:18:56.570 --> 04:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
see a seasonal dock on top of a nest I
 
04:18:58.130 --> 04:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
think that that's something that is very
 
04:19:01.790 --> 04:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
clear-cut but the word impact could also
 
04:19:06.490 --> 04:19:06.500 align:start position:0%
be the the migration pattern of the Loon
 
04:19:09.889 --> 04:19:09.899 align:start position:0%
which going back to the property owner
 
04:19:13.309 --> 04:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
the layperson I'm not sure that that the
 
04:19:15.290 --> 04:19:15.300 align:start position:0%
lay person would be able to interpret
 
04:19:18.349 --> 04:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
the word impact if there was an
 
04:19:20.269 --> 04:19:20.279 align:start position:0%
endangered species that traveled through
 
04:19:23.809 --> 04:19:23.819 align:start position:0%
their property so many times a year so I
 
04:19:27.950 --> 04:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
think uh the bill needs some edits in
 
04:19:30.290 --> 04:19:30.300 align:start position:0%
order to protect the private property
 
04:19:33.349 --> 04:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
rights of the individual and I apologize
 
04:19:35.269 --> 04:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
for stumbling earlier in the testimony
 
04:19:39.469 --> 04:19:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:42.229 --> 04:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
representative wrong for a question
 
04:19:44.750 --> 04:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and and thank you Mr
 
04:19:47.210 --> 04:19:47.220 align:start position:0%
Norwood for taking my question a couple
 
04:19:47.220 --> 04:19:48.469 align:start position:0%
Norwood for taking my question a couple
questions

04:19:48.469 --> 04:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:19:50.570 --> 04:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
um when you raise the issue about the
 
04:19:54.290 --> 04:19:54.300 align:start position:0%
word impacted if the word negatively was
 
04:19:57.170 --> 04:19:57.180 align:start position:0%
inserted before impacted so negatively
 
04:20:00.290 --> 04:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
impact would that resolve your concern
 
04:20:01.670 --> 04:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
04:20:01.680 --> 04:20:02.750 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
question

04:20:02.750 --> 04:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:20:05.809 --> 04:20:05.819 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it's the word negative
 
04:20:08.030 --> 04:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
or positive impact I think it's
 
04:20:10.849 --> 04:20:10.859 align:start position:0%
specifically the word impact
 
04:20:10.859 --> 04:20:12.050 align:start position:0%
specifically the word impact
um

04:20:12.050 --> 04:20:12.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:14.990 --> 04:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
maybe needing a a word at the end of
 
04:20:18.170 --> 04:20:18.180 align:start position:0%
impact if it's negatively impacting The
 
04:20:21.229 --> 04:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
Nest I think that again the layperson
 
04:20:23.150 --> 04:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
could look at a nest and understand that
 
04:20:25.189 --> 04:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
they're hitting their dock is going to
 
04:20:26.689 --> 04:20:26.699 align:start position:0%
go on a nest that's something that's
 
04:20:29.809 --> 04:20:29.819 align:start position:0%
easily distinguishable but if the
 
04:20:32.389 --> 04:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
favorite food of the endangered species
 
04:20:35.870 --> 04:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
happens to live near where your seasonal
 
04:20:38.450 --> 04:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
Dock and I wouldn't know that as a
 
04:20:38.460 --> 04:20:39.650 align:start position:0%
Dock and I wouldn't know that as a
layperson

04:20:39.650 --> 04:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
layperson
 
04:20:42.849 --> 04:20:42.859 align:start position:0%
that's where there's vagary in that word
 
04:20:45.650 --> 04:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
is it the impact of the the breeding
 
04:20:48.530 --> 04:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
grounds is it impact of their traveling
 
04:20:50.769 --> 04:20:50.779 align:start position:0%
is it impact of their
 
04:20:54.530 --> 04:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
eating grounds that's that's the vagary
 
04:20:57.050 --> 04:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
behind the the word it needs a modifier
 
04:20:59.330 --> 04:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
that's what that's it I think it needs a
 
04:21:01.630 --> 04:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
modifier on the back end of it okay
 
04:21:04.910 --> 04:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chair thank you
 
04:21:07.790 --> 04:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
and this kind of goes in along with that
 
04:21:07.800 --> 04:21:09.410 align:start position:0%
and this kind of goes in along with that
so

04:21:09.410 --> 04:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:21:13.729 --> 04:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
um when you're you're let me see
 
04:21:13.739 --> 04:21:14.630 align:start position:0%
um when you're you're let me see
um

04:21:14.630 --> 04:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:18.830 --> 04:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
so your concern I'm I'm trying to find
 
04:21:21.530 --> 04:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
out if do you have a suggested remedy
 
04:21:24.410 --> 04:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
that would make this bill
 
04:21:26.389 --> 04:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
um be one that the Realtors could
 
04:21:28.309 --> 04:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
support I I appreciate the question
 
04:21:31.309 --> 04:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
representative so a lot of my work all
 
04:21:32.750 --> 04:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
of my work is done in the commercial
 
04:21:35.210 --> 04:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
real estate world and you may be
 
04:21:38.030 --> 04:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
familiar if you in the state disturb
 
04:21:41.330 --> 04:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
roughly two acres of land it triggers an
 
04:21:43.670 --> 04:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
alterations of terrains permit which
 
04:21:46.250 --> 04:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
would in that instance invite in a
 
04:21:48.170 --> 04:21:48.180 align:start position:0%
number of state agencies including fish
 
04:21:49.550 --> 04:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
and game
 
04:21:54.110 --> 04:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
um to to conduct a survey of the in most
 
04:21:55.849 --> 04:21:55.859 align:start position:0%
cases commercial property being
 
04:21:59.689 --> 04:21:59.699 align:start position:0%
developed that would necessitate a study
 
04:22:02.330 --> 04:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
of the the fishing game within that
 
04:22:02.340 --> 04:22:03.349 align:start position:0%
of the the fishing game within that
community

04:22:03.349 --> 04:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:22:07.189 --> 04:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
so what I would like to see is some
 
04:22:09.410 --> 04:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
clarification is that what we're talking
 
04:22:11.330 --> 04:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
about because I'm not sure
 
04:22:14.030 --> 04:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
are we asking for the equivalent of an
 
04:22:16.490 --> 04:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
alteration of terrains permit Fish and
 
04:22:19.490 --> 04:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
Game portion of an aot being inserted
 
04:22:21.290 --> 04:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
for a seasonal dock
 
04:22:25.729 --> 04:22:25.739 align:start position:0%
and if so what those costs would be and
 
04:22:27.849 --> 04:22:27.859 align:start position:0%
if that's something that is done
 
04:22:31.250 --> 04:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
administratively I my Layman's
 
04:22:32.809 --> 04:22:32.819 align:start position:0%
understanding of that piece because I'm
 
04:22:35.689 --> 04:22:35.699 align:start position:0%
not an engineer is that there are
 
04:22:38.750 --> 04:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
databases that suggest territorial areas
 
04:22:41.929 --> 04:22:41.939 align:start position:0%
where endangered species live so can it
 
04:22:43.790 --> 04:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
be done administratively on a computer
 
04:22:47.269 --> 04:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
or is it something that would require an
 
04:22:50.150 --> 04:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
in-person boots on the ground survey and
 
04:22:52.189 --> 04:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
again what are the costs what are the
 
04:22:54.469 --> 04:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
timelines surrounding those so so those
 
04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
are the areas where I'd like to
 
04:22:59.330 --> 04:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
understand a little bit more how a
 
04:23:03.309 --> 04:23:03.319 align:start position:0%
property owner would get Des
 
04:23:07.790 --> 04:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
sign off on this new bullet point 11.
 
04:23:09.410 --> 04:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
can you indulge me for one more
 
04:23:12.889 --> 04:23:12.899 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chair for a follow-up okay
 
04:23:12.899 --> 04:23:13.969 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chair for a follow-up okay
um

04:23:13.969 --> 04:23:13.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:15.889 --> 04:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
but you're talking about property owner
 
04:23:19.370 --> 04:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
and I recognize that the owner owns the
 
04:23:21.650 --> 04:23:21.660 align:start position:0%
dock but the property we're talking
 
04:23:23.990 --> 04:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
about is water that's under State
 
04:23:29.210 --> 04:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
control so would it would it satisfy
 
04:23:32.030 --> 04:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
your concerns if the property owner was
 
04:23:34.250 --> 04:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
notified by it could be the loom
 
04:23:36.410 --> 04:23:36.420 align:start position:0%
preservation Alliance working with fish
 
04:23:40.130 --> 04:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
and game or Des to inform them that
 
04:23:42.710 --> 04:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
where their dock is located over the
 
04:23:45.349 --> 04:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
state waters that it's posing a negative
 
04:23:48.229 --> 04:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
impact to an endangered species
 
04:23:49.729 --> 04:23:49.739 align:start position:0%
I think it's a great question
 
04:23:52.309 --> 04:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
representative and if there was a if we
 
04:23:55.250 --> 04:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
understood better the mechanism in
 
04:23:58.070 --> 04:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
the only way that I have been able to
 
04:23:59.630 --> 04:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
interpret it is through the lens of
 
04:24:02.389 --> 04:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
alteration of terrain's permits and if
 
04:24:05.210 --> 04:24:05.220 align:start position:0%
we better understood the mechanism and
 
04:24:07.309 --> 04:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
we better understood the definition of
 
04:24:09.710 --> 04:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
that word impact I think it could be
 
04:24:12.110 --> 04:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
something that would be agreeable again
 
04:24:16.130 --> 04:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
we're not looking to have a doc go right
 
04:24:16.140 --> 04:24:17.150 align:start position:0%
we're not looking to have a doc go right
over

04:24:17.150 --> 04:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:24:19.189 --> 04:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
that Nest but there's a lot of other
 
04:24:21.590 --> 04:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
vagaries that we'd like clarified thank
 
04:24:23.090 --> 04:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you thank you Mr
 
04:24:23.100 --> 04:24:25.189 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you thank you Mr
chair

04:24:25.189 --> 04:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:24:28.309 --> 04:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
representative wolf for a question
 
04:24:30.229 --> 04:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:24:32.150 --> 04:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:24:34.309 --> 04:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
um this does not
 
04:24:34.319 --> 04:24:36.110 align:start position:0%
um this does not
specify

04:24:36.110 --> 04:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
specify
 
04:24:39.229 --> 04:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
who is going to give you a certification
 
04:24:41.870 --> 04:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
or even if you need a certification
 
04:24:44.389 --> 04:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
it prohibits it so if you call somebody
 
04:24:48.290 --> 04:24:48.300 align:start position:0%
from the Audubon Society and come up and
 
04:24:50.450 --> 04:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
look at your property or know that your
 
04:24:54.950 --> 04:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
property is exempt that may satisfy or
 
04:24:57.530 --> 04:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
if you have a friend who does Wetland
 
04:25:00.830 --> 04:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
studies and does this I mean the aot
 
04:25:03.050 --> 04:25:03.060 align:start position:0%
permit says a hundred thousand square
 
04:25:03.060 --> 04:25:04.189 align:start position:0%
permit says a hundred thousand square
feet

04:25:04.189 --> 04:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
feet
 
04:25:06.110 --> 04:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
do you know what a hundred thousand
 
04:25:08.750 --> 04:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
square feet is by looking at it no you
 
04:25:10.729 --> 04:25:10.739 align:start position:0%
have to go out and get somebody that
 
04:25:14.510 --> 04:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
tells you what it is and I think and the
 
04:25:16.910 --> 04:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
question then is
 
04:25:19.910 --> 04:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
does this require a certification or
 
04:25:22.969 --> 04:25:22.979 align:start position:0%
just knowledge that it's in a prohibited
 
04:25:22.979 --> 04:25:24.290 align:start position:0%
just knowledge that it's in a prohibited
area

04:25:24.290 --> 04:25:24.300 align:start position:0%
area
 
04:25:26.330 --> 04:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
representative wolf thank you for uh
 
04:25:29.150 --> 04:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
asking the question I would say that's
 
04:25:32.150 --> 04:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
the concern is is the lack of clarity is
 
04:25:35.870 --> 04:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
so who's who is um
 
04:25:38.389 --> 04:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
the legislation doesn't as I see it
 
04:25:41.630 --> 04:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
contemplate whose standard uh is giving
 
04:25:44.450 --> 04:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
the sign off on this bullet point 11.
 
04:25:46.910 --> 04:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
and whether or not it could be you know
 
04:25:50.450 --> 04:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
the the Audubon Society or fishing game
 
04:25:52.189 --> 04:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
or perhaps
 
04:25:58.309 --> 04:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:00.769 --> 04:26:00.779 align:start position:0%
cription for a follow-up follow-up
 
04:26:03.530 --> 04:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
04:26:06.349 --> 04:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
is there a sign off needed I don't
 
04:26:08.330 --> 04:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
interpret this as a sign off being
 
04:26:10.309 --> 04:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
needed it just says you can't put it
 
04:26:12.790 --> 04:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
where it's prohibited
 
04:26:14.450 --> 04:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for the
 
04:26:16.849 --> 04:26:16.859 align:start position:0%
follow-up I would defer to the folks
 
04:26:19.250 --> 04:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
from Des who were the ones that
 
04:26:22.670 --> 04:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
administer the permits and perhaps they
 
04:26:24.710 --> 04:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
could shed some light if if a new
 
04:26:26.570 --> 04:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
standard is inserted
 
04:26:28.250 --> 04:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
how they would
 
04:26:30.530 --> 04:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
um they would look to an applicant to
 
04:26:33.170 --> 04:26:33.180 align:start position:0%
prove either yay or nay on that bullet
 
04:26:35.269 --> 04:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
point 11.
 
04:26:35.279 --> 04:26:37.070 align:start position:0%
point 11.
yeah

04:26:37.070 --> 04:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:26:42.110 --> 04:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
is that it move a follow-up or yes okay
 
04:26:43.849 --> 04:26:43.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:26:47.769 --> 04:26:47.779 align:start position:0%
I think that this all
 
04:26:50.750 --> 04:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
rule exempts you from getting a permit
 
04:26:54.610 --> 04:26:54.620 align:start position:0%
yes you just have to file notice to Des
 
04:26:57.889 --> 04:26:57.899 align:start position:0%
and if you file notice you're saying
 
04:26:59.450 --> 04:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
that it's not in a prohibited area
 
04:27:01.610 --> 04:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
you're saying that it's more than 30
 
04:27:05.450 --> 04:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
feet so Des does not issue
 
04:27:08.330 --> 04:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
and there's somebody here from Des or a
 
04:27:10.670 --> 04:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
permit so I believe that it's incumbent
 
04:27:13.030 --> 04:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
upon the property owner
 
04:27:17.149 --> 04:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
to comply with these 11 statements
 
04:27:21.170 --> 04:27:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:24.290 --> 04:27:24.300 align:start position:0%
yes representative I I think the use of
 
04:27:26.030 --> 04:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
my use of the word permit was uh
 
04:27:28.670 --> 04:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
inappropriate notification is perhaps
 
04:27:30.889 --> 04:27:30.899 align:start position:0%
the better word
 
04:27:34.010 --> 04:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
the the law I mean that's going to all
 
04:27:37.010 --> 04:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
come back to me now the uh the commit
 
04:27:40.070 --> 04:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
the commission that met uh on exactly
 
04:27:44.269 --> 04:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
this issue of uh uh permits or or the
 
04:27:48.349 --> 04:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
the the not a need for a permit for
 
04:27:52.610 --> 04:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
temporary docs and if you met the
 
04:27:54.830 --> 04:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
certain requirements
 
04:27:58.370 --> 04:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
uh that are listed in here you then did
 
04:28:00.530 --> 04:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
need a permanent cut you didn't have to
 
04:28:02.570 --> 04:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
apply for a permit ever each and every
 
04:28:07.130 --> 04:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
year uh so so this would not was would
 
04:28:10.250 --> 04:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
this issue with species would would uh
 
04:28:13.550 --> 04:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
unless they were there to to at the
 
04:28:13.560 --> 04:28:14.689 align:start position:0%
unless they were there to to at the
beginning

04:28:14.689 --> 04:28:14.699 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
04:28:17.269 --> 04:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't have wouldn't apply so
 
04:28:19.910 --> 04:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
if someone sees species there or makes a
 
04:28:22.670 --> 04:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
complaint that would then go to if I'm
 
04:28:26.450 --> 04:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
not mistaken the uh fishing game
 
04:28:29.450 --> 04:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
um I would think and this is in other
 
04:28:31.729 --> 04:28:31.739 align:start position:0%
words but it was it's not
 
04:28:34.189 --> 04:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
prohib it's
 
04:28:38.149 --> 04:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
right but it will it will but then and
 
04:28:40.969 --> 04:28:40.979 align:start position:0%
if that then occurs
 
04:28:44.030 --> 04:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
then then there's issues about about the
 
04:28:48.170 --> 04:28:48.180 align:start position:0%
about the dock uh but it it can affect
 
04:28:50.090 --> 04:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
the permit because it's not allowed but
 
04:28:53.210 --> 04:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
again I'm not uh I don't want to Mr
 
04:28:55.610 --> 04:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
chair if I could yeah and again I think
 
04:28:57.830 --> 04:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative wolf I I again
 
04:28:59.689 --> 04:28:59.699 align:start position:0%
apologize because I think my use of the
 
04:29:02.210 --> 04:29:02.220 align:start position:0%
word permit uh was inappropriate and
 
04:29:05.210 --> 04:29:05.220 align:start position:0%
when you go to the word notification I
 
04:29:06.769 --> 04:29:06.779 align:start position:0%
still think it goes back to the original
 
04:29:09.530 --> 04:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
portion of of the testimony whereby we
 
04:29:13.250 --> 04:29:13.260 align:start position:0%
had the discussion about um impact so
 
04:29:15.710 --> 04:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
we're we're in favor if we can come to
 
04:29:18.530 --> 04:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
some agreement with how that gets
 
04:29:21.349 --> 04:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
adjudicated you know in your example Mr
 
04:29:21.359 --> 04:29:22.550 align:start position:0%
adjudicated you know in your example Mr
chair

04:29:22.550 --> 04:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:29:26.269 --> 04:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
um a third party Witnesses uh endangered
 
04:29:28.910 --> 04:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
species traveling the property notifies
 
04:29:31.910 --> 04:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
Des would that then harm your renewal
 
04:29:34.130 --> 04:29:34.140 align:start position:0%
the next time you go to file the
 
04:29:37.250 --> 04:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
notification again is the impact based
 
04:29:37.260 --> 04:29:38.570 align:start position:0%
notification again is the impact based
upon

04:29:38.570 --> 04:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
upon
 
04:29:41.450 --> 04:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
um seasonal travelings nesting speeding
 
04:29:41.460 --> 04:29:42.229 align:start position:0%
um seasonal travelings nesting speeding
ground

04:29:42.229 --> 04:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
ground
 
04:29:44.870 --> 04:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I think that there is a
 
04:29:46.790 --> 04:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
solution in the middle I just think we
 
04:29:48.410 --> 04:29:48.420 align:start position:0%
need to find it
 
04:29:52.490 --> 04:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
I don't believe there uh there there is
 
04:29:56.389 --> 04:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
no re once you get the permit
 
04:29:58.189 --> 04:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
you have it
 
04:30:02.689 --> 04:30:02.699 align:start position:0%
now uh and I think uh unless there's a
 
04:30:05.630 --> 04:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
complaint to the Des and that would be
 
04:30:09.590 --> 04:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
my point yes or or somebody complains to
 
04:30:12.910 --> 04:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
the uh fishing game
 
04:30:16.370 --> 04:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
that that would then trigger some some
 
04:30:19.790 --> 04:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:23.210 --> 04:30:23.220 align:start position:0%
other than that it's uh if someone can
 
04:30:25.849 --> 04:30:25.859 align:start position:0%
if if they find that they're out of
 
04:30:25.859 --> 04:30:27.469 align:start position:0%
if if they find that they're out of
compliance

04:30:27.469 --> 04:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
04:30:31.790 --> 04:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
they can they have to deal with that
 
04:30:31.800 --> 04:30:34.189 align:start position:0%
they can they have to deal with that
uh

04:30:34.189 --> 04:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:30:39.110 --> 04:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:42.050 --> 04:30:42.060 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing none thank you Mr chair thank
 
04:30:44.269 --> 04:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
you members
 
04:30:44.279 --> 04:30:46.189 align:start position:0%
you members
um

04:30:46.189 --> 04:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:46.199 --> 04:30:50.090 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:30:50.090 --> 04:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:54.229 --> 04:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:11.030 --> 04:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:13.729 --> 04:31:13.739 align:start position:0%
have written copies of testimony from
 
04:31:15.590 --> 04:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
the waste management advisory committee
 
04:31:17.389 --> 04:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire followed as well as
 
04:31:18.769 --> 04:31:18.779 align:start position:0%
from Williamson
 
04:31:20.929 --> 04:31:20.939 align:start position:0%
oh wait a minute
 
04:31:23.510 --> 04:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
hi what do we have here oh this is about
 
04:31:25.130 --> 04:31:25.140 align:start position:0%
to say three different letters three
 
04:31:27.769 --> 04:31:27.779 align:start position:0%
different letters and they're all going
 
04:31:29.290 --> 04:31:29.300 align:start position:0%
that way
 
04:31:57.530 --> 04:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:57.540 --> 04:32:43.969 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:32:43.969 --> 04:32:43.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:46.309 --> 04:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
however despite those intensive efforts
 
04:32:49.130 --> 04:32:49.140 align:start position:0%
built in half the holyness excuse me
 
04:32:53.030 --> 04:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:56.870 --> 04:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh down down below there we are good
 
04:32:56.880 --> 04:33:05.090 align:start position:0%
uh down down below there we are good
okay

04:33:05.090 --> 04:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:08.689 --> 04:33:08.699 align:start position:0%
okay let's try that again there we are
 
04:33:11.269 --> 04:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
all right it looks like it's staying on
 
04:33:12.590 --> 04:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
this time
 
04:33:15.289 --> 04:33:15.299 align:start position:0%
um so as as I was saying despite lpc's
 
04:33:17.090 --> 04:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
intensive management efforts close to
 
04:33:20.090 --> 04:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
half of loon nests fail every year the
 
04:33:21.949 --> 04:33:21.959 align:start position:0%
recovery of loons in New Hampshire to
 
04:33:23.990 --> 04:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
date has been hard won the growth of the
 
04:33:26.810 --> 04:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
population has been just 2.1 percent per
 
04:33:29.510 --> 04:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
year over the past 10 years and loon
 
04:33:31.369 --> 04:33:31.379 align:start position:0%
numbers are still well below their
 
04:33:33.529 --> 04:33:33.539 align:start position:0%
historical levels despite lpc's
 
04:33:35.689 --> 04:33:35.699 align:start position:0%
intensive research management and
 
04:33:37.551 --> 04:33:37.561 align:start position:0%
Outreach to help them
 
04:33:39.230 --> 04:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's Wildlife action plan
 
04:33:41.090 --> 04:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
lists Shoreline protection as an
 
04:33:43.310 --> 04:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
objective for loons and other species
 
04:33:45.709 --> 04:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
and this proposed legislation is a step
 
04:33:47.750 --> 04:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
to help achieve that goal
 
04:33:50.029 --> 04:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
and therefore LPC supports efforts to
 
04:33:51.529 --> 04:33:51.539 align:start position:0%
protect threaten and endangered species
 
04:33:53.689 --> 04:33:53.699 align:start position:0%
from disturbance from dogs whether they
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
are permanent or temporary during
 
04:33:57.949 --> 04:33:57.959 align:start position:0%
critical nesting periods and that
 
04:33:59.570 --> 04:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
concludes my testimony I would be happy
 
04:34:07.429 --> 04:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:09.529 --> 04:34:09.539 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:34:09.539 --> 04:34:11.689 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

04:34:11.689 --> 04:34:11.699 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:34:13.849 --> 04:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
we have any questions by members of the
 
04:34:16.670 --> 04:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
committee representative Darby
 
04:34:18.289 --> 04:34:18.299 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:34:20.090 --> 04:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
my question uh can you address the
 
04:34:22.070 --> 04:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
current concern earlier about how the
 
04:34:24.709 --> 04:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
word impact could be rewarded rewarded
 
04:34:28.551 --> 04:34:28.561 align:start position:0%
to identify the areas that a layperson
 
04:34:30.410 --> 04:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
could identify where they could not
 
04:34:34.910 --> 04:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:36.109 --> 04:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
04:34:38.150 --> 04:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you for the for the
 
04:34:38.160 --> 04:34:39.230 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you for the for the
question

04:34:39.230 --> 04:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:34:41.390 --> 04:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
um in terms of of impacts I think the
 
04:34:43.849 --> 04:34:43.859 align:start position:0%
the most critical period of elune's life
 
04:34:45.470 --> 04:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
cycle is when they are nesting that's
 
04:34:47.570 --> 04:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
when they are tied to place and and they
 
04:34:49.670 --> 04:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
cannot easily escape from an obstruction
 
04:34:52.131 --> 04:34:52.141 align:start position:0%
recreational use of the lake or some
 
04:34:55.250 --> 04:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
other uh form and so that represents a
 
04:34:56.869 --> 04:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
real bottleneck to the loom population
 
04:34:59.090 --> 04:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
as we said close to half of our lewdness
 
04:35:01.189 --> 04:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
fail every year despite these intensive
 
04:35:04.250 --> 04:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
uh efforts to to protect them uh so
 
04:35:06.289 --> 04:35:06.299 align:start position:0%
certainly one One impact of of note
 
04:35:08.090 --> 04:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
would be a nest failure or the potential
 
04:35:11.150 --> 04:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
to have a nest failure my thought as I
 
04:35:14.330 --> 04:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
was reading this this bill was that um
 
04:35:17.269 --> 04:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
if if there is a dock that is close to a
 
04:35:19.551 --> 04:35:19.561 align:start position:0%
loon Nest I don't think that loon cares
 
04:35:21.590 --> 04:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
if it's a permanent or seasonal dock to
 
04:35:23.810 --> 04:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
that loon it's just a dock and it would
 
04:35:25.131 --> 04:35:25.141 align:start position:0%
have the same impact whether it was
 
04:35:28.670 --> 04:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
permanent or or seasonal uh and so my my
 
04:35:30.349 --> 04:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
um thought and and I'm no expert in this
 
04:35:32.929 --> 04:35:32.939 align:start position:0%
by any means but if we apply the same
 
04:35:35.631 --> 04:35:35.641 align:start position:0%
standards as we do to a permanent doc to
 
04:35:37.551 --> 04:35:37.561 align:start position:0%
a temporary dock that would go a long
 
04:35:39.830 --> 04:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
way towards addressing these issues and
 
04:35:42.410 --> 04:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
I believe that impacts to loons they are
 
04:35:44.029 --> 04:35:44.039 align:start position:0%
probably defined by Department of
 
04:35:45.349 --> 04:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services in New Hampshire
 
04:35:48.349 --> 04:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
fishing in-game for permanent docks if
 
04:35:49.849 --> 04:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
we could apply that same
 
04:35:52.189 --> 04:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
level of scrutiny to the temporary docs
 
04:35:53.689 --> 04:35:53.699 align:start position:0%
I think that that would probably address
 
04:35:57.410 --> 04:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:00.590 --> 04:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up thank you Mr chair thank
 
04:36:00.600 --> 04:36:01.490 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up thank you Mr chair thank
you

04:36:01.490 --> 04:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:36:01.500 --> 04:36:02.689 align:start position:0%
you
so

04:36:02.689 --> 04:36:02.699 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:36:05.090 --> 04:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
being someone that has a temporary doc
 
04:36:07.849 --> 04:36:07.859 align:start position:0%
seasonal temporary Doc and on a lake
 
04:36:10.369 --> 04:36:10.379 align:start position:0%
where we have an increasing Lumen
 
04:36:10.379 --> 04:36:11.390 align:start position:0%
where we have an increasing Lumen
population

04:36:11.390 --> 04:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
population
 
04:36:11.400 --> 04:36:12.830 align:start position:0%
population
and

04:36:12.830 --> 04:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:36:15.709 --> 04:36:15.719 align:start position:0%
um having seen
 
04:36:18.529 --> 04:36:18.539 align:start position:0%
loon's nest in an area of this last year
 
04:36:21.470 --> 04:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
where they had not previously nested how
 
04:36:25.429 --> 04:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
would a homeowner account for that case
 
04:36:28.189 --> 04:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
how would they say you know no oh it may
 
04:36:30.349 --> 04:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
be the dot maybe the Loon is nesting on
 
04:36:31.910 --> 04:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
my property this year
 
04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so every year the Loon preservation
 
04:36:36.949 --> 04:36:36.959 align:start position:0%
committee submits all of the details of
 
04:36:38.689 --> 04:36:38.699 align:start position:0%
loon nesting areas and these are
 
04:36:40.609 --> 04:36:40.619 align:start position:0%
geolocated so you submit those to the
 
04:36:43.010 --> 04:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
natural heritage Bureau and at that
 
04:36:44.689 --> 04:36:44.699 align:start position:0%
point they become part of that inventory
 
04:36:48.230 --> 04:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
and I believe that if there is a a um at
 
04:36:51.250 --> 04:36:51.260 align:start position:0%
this point if there's a permit for a a
 
04:36:54.830 --> 04:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
permanent Dock and it falls within it
 
04:36:57.769 --> 04:36:57.779 align:start position:0%
may be 50 meters or 50 yards might be
 
04:37:00.170 --> 04:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
100 yards that gets flagged for review
 
04:37:01.849 --> 04:37:01.859 align:start position:0%
by Department of Environmental Services
 
04:37:04.789 --> 04:37:04.799 align:start position:0%
I would imagine that perhaps the same
 
04:37:07.189 --> 04:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
the same thing would be true for a
 
04:37:09.289 --> 04:37:09.299 align:start position:0%
seasonal bucks uh if something if
 
04:37:12.529 --> 04:37:12.539 align:start position:0%
legislation such as this were enacted
 
04:37:15.250 --> 04:37:15.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:37:19.070 --> 04:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
representative wolf our question if you
 
04:37:22.789 --> 04:37:22.799 align:start position:0%
put the same restrictions on a temporary
 
04:37:24.890 --> 04:37:24.900 align:start position:0%
dock that you're putting on a permanent
 
04:37:28.131 --> 04:37:28.141 align:start position:0%
dock that defeats the whole purpose of a
 
04:37:31.429 --> 04:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
permanent permit by negot
 
04:37:34.609 --> 04:37:34.619 align:start position:0%
the permit by notification
 
04:37:37.609 --> 04:37:37.619 align:start position:0%
so you're making it very difficult for
 
04:37:41.570 --> 04:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
somebody to put in a temporary dock just
 
04:37:43.789 --> 04:37:43.799 align:start position:0%
by notifying des and meeting the 11
 
04:37:43.799 --> 04:37:45.709 align:start position:0%
by notifying des and meeting the 11
requirements

04:37:45.709 --> 04:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:37:51.051 --> 04:37:51.061 align:start position:0%
so if you follow the requirement for a
 
04:37:53.029 --> 04:37:53.039 align:start position:0%
permanent talk
 
04:37:55.730 --> 04:37:55.740 align:start position:0%
that's quite a bit more stringent than
 
04:37:56.869 --> 04:37:56.879 align:start position:0%
what this
 
04:37:59.390 --> 04:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
permit by notification is am I not
 
04:37:59.400 --> 04:38:01.070 align:start position:0%
permit by notification is am I not
correct

04:38:01.070 --> 04:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:38:02.750 --> 04:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
04:38:05.750 --> 04:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative I am not an expert on on
 
04:38:08.090 --> 04:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
permitting docs by any means I would
 
04:38:09.529 --> 04:38:09.539 align:start position:0%
think that if Department of
 
04:38:10.849 --> 04:38:10.859 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services or New Hampshire
 
04:38:13.010 --> 04:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
fishing game is the actual agency that
 
04:38:15.289 --> 04:38:15.299 align:start position:0%
does that permitting procedure the
 
04:38:16.490 --> 04:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
extent of the Loon preservation
 
04:38:18.230 --> 04:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
committee's involvement in the past has
 
04:38:20.869 --> 04:38:20.879 align:start position:0%
been to to send this data on the
 
04:38:23.631 --> 04:38:23.641 align:start position:0%
location of where Lou nests are and on
 
04:38:26.750 --> 04:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
occasion if there is a a request for a
 
04:38:30.170 --> 04:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
doc a permanent doc that flags that then
 
04:38:33.289 --> 04:38:33.299 align:start position:0%
we will we will respond with comments to
 
04:38:35.150 --> 04:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services or
 
04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:40.750 --> 04:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up
 
04:38:45.131 --> 04:38:45.141 align:start position:0%
so what you just stated is that Des
 
04:38:49.269 --> 04:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
knows where the loans are by your
 
04:38:53.449 --> 04:38:53.459 align:start position:0%
notification every year yes so there is
 
04:38:55.849 --> 04:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
clearly then a way either for the
 
04:38:59.750 --> 04:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
homeowner or Des when the notice permit
 
04:39:02.510 --> 04:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
by notification is applied for
 
04:39:05.090 --> 04:39:05.100 align:start position:0%
to know whether there's a loon Nest May
 
04:39:06.230 --> 04:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
or not
 
04:39:10.670 --> 04:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
I believe yes once a once a permit for a
 
04:39:13.910 --> 04:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
permanent dock is is submitted if there
 
04:39:15.650 --> 04:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
is a loon nesting within that certain
 
04:39:18.470 --> 04:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
distance then we are notified and I
 
04:39:22.789 --> 04:39:22.799 align:start position:0%
would I would imagine that um one way of
 
04:39:25.189 --> 04:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
of accomplishing this legislation might
 
04:39:27.349 --> 04:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
be to to have that same requirement for
 
04:39:29.990 --> 04:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
a temporary dog but again I'm I'm I
 
04:39:32.631 --> 04:39:32.641 align:start position:0%
really can only speak to impacts of uh
 
04:39:36.590 --> 04:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:39.470 --> 04:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:41.150 --> 04:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
representative wrong for a question
 
04:39:43.310 --> 04:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:39:45.530 --> 04:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:39:47.270 --> 04:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned how the Loon
 
04:39:48.948 --> 04:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
preservation Alliance
 
04:39:52.788 --> 04:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
surveys Lakes to determine where nesting
 
04:39:54.288 --> 04:39:54.298 align:start position:0%
grounds might be and they pass that
 
04:39:56.750 --> 04:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
information on which ultimately gets to
 
04:39:59.690 --> 04:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
Des are there other organizations in New
 
04:40:02.270 --> 04:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that also do that or do all
 
04:40:04.430 --> 04:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
the Loon nests in the state
 
04:40:07.070 --> 04:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
we are balloon preservation committee is
 
04:40:08.868 --> 04:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
is really the organization that that
 
04:40:11.030 --> 04:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
collates that so we have a large network
 
04:40:13.850 --> 04:40:13.860 align:start position:0%
of volunteers and small paid staff and
 
04:40:16.130 --> 04:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
uh so we will go out and Survey Lakes
 
04:40:19.730 --> 04:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
about 360 Lakes uh this past summer not
 
04:40:21.170 --> 04:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
all of those Lakes have loons on them
 
04:40:22.610 --> 04:40:22.620 align:start position:0%
but all of them have the potential to
 
04:40:23.868 --> 04:40:23.878 align:start position:0%
have loons we hope more of them will
 
04:40:25.730 --> 04:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
have loons in the future and in the
 
04:40:28.010 --> 04:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
course of of that surveying uh whether
 
04:40:29.390 --> 04:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
that's uh whether we get that
 
04:40:31.730 --> 04:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
information from our our seasonal field
 
04:40:33.948 --> 04:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
biologists from our volunteers or from
 
04:40:36.470 --> 04:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
anybody else in in the public while we
 
04:40:38.090 --> 04:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
will incorporate that into our database
 
04:40:40.550 --> 04:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
which then gets submitted to the natural
 
04:40:43.850 --> 04:40:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:43.860 --> 04:40:47.510 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:40:47.510 --> 04:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:50.570 --> 04:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
representative gold yes thank you for
 
04:40:52.730 --> 04:40:52.740 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:40:54.670 --> 04:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
um just to curiosity
 
04:40:57.230 --> 04:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
a person has a
 
04:40:59.150 --> 04:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
um a regular dog
 
04:41:01.270 --> 04:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:41:05.690 --> 04:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
alone decides to put a nest near it how
 
04:41:08.090 --> 04:41:08.100 align:start position:0%
is that taken care of
 
04:41:10.430 --> 04:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you for the the question
 
04:41:12.590 --> 04:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
representative and and uh it's a it's a
 
04:41:16.128 --> 04:41:16.138 align:start position:0%
good question uh I I know of certain
 
04:41:18.830 --> 04:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
instances where loons have nested quite
 
04:41:21.010 --> 04:41:21.020 align:start position:0%
close to docs and other other structures
 
04:41:24.530 --> 04:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
if that dock is already there and that
 
04:41:27.770 --> 04:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
loon nests close to it we will attempt
 
04:41:30.350 --> 04:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
to work with the landowner and and uh
 
04:41:32.868 --> 04:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
and see what can be what can be done to
 
04:41:34.250 --> 04:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
minimize you know disturbance and
 
04:41:36.708 --> 04:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
impacts to those to those loons
 
04:41:38.690 --> 04:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
um on uh in fact on some there's an
 
04:41:40.310 --> 04:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
island on Squam Lake
 
04:41:42.830 --> 04:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
um perch Island uh where the where the
 
04:41:45.410 --> 04:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
owners of their cabin actually will not
 
04:41:47.570 --> 04:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
come to their cabin until after the Loon
 
04:41:49.910 --> 04:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
has finished nesting um and and leaves
 
04:41:52.970 --> 04:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
not all of you know property owners are
 
04:41:54.770 --> 04:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
that accommodating but we attempt to
 
04:41:57.110 --> 04:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
work with them in order to to have that
 
04:42:04.368 --> 04:42:04.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:07.788 --> 04:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
no one else thank you very much thank
 
04:42:07.798 --> 04:42:11.030 align:start position:0%
no one else thank you very much thank
you

04:42:11.030 --> 04:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:12.708 --> 04:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
I know it said
 
04:42:15.470 --> 04:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
and it was kind of unfair to hit people
 
04:42:18.530 --> 04:42:18.540 align:start position:0%
with uh with a question and I noticed
 
04:42:23.510 --> 04:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
that the uh chair of the aforementioned
 
04:42:28.128 --> 04:42:28.138 align:start position:0%
commission uh that on on temporary docs
 
04:42:32.570 --> 04:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:36.170 --> 04:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
uh if if you if I mean
 
04:42:39.708 --> 04:42:39.718 align:start position:0%
the issue is around a
 
04:42:39.718 --> 04:42:41.448 align:start position:0%
the issue is around a
loon

04:42:41.448 --> 04:42:41.458 align:start position:0%
loon
 
04:42:45.650 --> 04:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
uh what happened with a loom starts uh
 
04:42:47.628 --> 04:42:47.638 align:start position:0%
nesting on a
 
04:42:51.050 --> 04:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
uh near a temporary dock did we do
 
04:42:52.850 --> 04:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
anything I don't believe we did much of
 
04:42:56.448 --> 04:42:56.458 align:start position:0%
anything on that maybe you uh uh might
 
04:42:56.458 --> 04:42:57.310 align:start position:0%
anything on that maybe you uh uh might
want

04:42:57.310 --> 04:42:57.320 align:start position:0%
want
 
04:42:59.990 --> 04:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
I want to comment on that if you could
 
04:43:02.270 --> 04:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
but if you you know if you if if you
 
04:43:05.750 --> 04:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
don't you don't uh okay if you yeah if
 
04:43:08.530 --> 04:43:08.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:10.788 --> 04:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
for the record this is representative
 
04:43:10.798 --> 04:43:14.150 align:start position:0%
for the record this is representative
McConkey

04:43:14.150 --> 04:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:17.868 --> 04:43:17.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
04:43:20.510 --> 04:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
um I am um representative Mark McConkey
 
04:43:24.170 --> 04:43:24.180 align:start position:0%
I was appointed to head the commission
 
04:43:27.530 --> 04:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh as your illustrious chairman I
 
04:43:29.930 --> 04:43:29.940 align:start position:0%
believe was on that commission and and
 
04:43:33.890 --> 04:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
former representative Smith also we
 
04:43:38.030 --> 04:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
tackled a lot of discussion uh but this
 
04:43:40.930 --> 04:43:40.940 align:start position:0%
mention of the Loon population
 
04:43:44.208 --> 04:43:44.218 align:start position:0%
uh in proximity to Temporary docks was
 
04:43:48.410 --> 04:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
was never an item that we considered nor
 
04:43:51.890 --> 04:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
was it brought to the commission and
 
04:43:55.610 --> 04:43:55.620 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it was an issue either so
 
04:43:58.270 --> 04:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
I I would have we had representation
 
04:44:00.470 --> 04:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
04:44:04.730 --> 04:44:04.740 align:start position:0%
and others on the commission so I'm
 
04:44:07.610 --> 04:44:07.620 align:start position:0%
not certain why if if the problem had
 
04:44:10.850 --> 04:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
Rose to that degree that we didn't hear
 
04:44:10.860 --> 04:44:11.890 align:start position:0%
Rose to that degree that we didn't hear
it

04:44:11.890 --> 04:44:11.900 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:44:14.868 --> 04:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
and since you've asked me to be here Mr
 
04:44:18.310 --> 04:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
chairman I've signed in against the bill
 
04:44:22.330 --> 04:44:22.340 align:start position:0%
because I think the language is too open
 
04:44:25.670 --> 04:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
when it says I believe in there it talks
 
04:44:30.590 --> 04:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
about any Wetlands or any vegetation and
 
04:44:32.628 --> 04:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
I would just hope that maybe this is one
 
04:44:35.448 --> 04:44:35.458 align:start position:0%
of those bills that should be held back
 
04:44:38.090 --> 04:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
and thought more about but not brought
 
04:44:41.570 --> 04:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
forward I when we worked on the
 
04:44:45.410 --> 04:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
commission we tried to find ways of
 
04:44:49.128 --> 04:44:49.138 align:start position:0%
streamlining processes looking at what
 
04:44:51.830 --> 04:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
the biggest issues were to date with uh
 
04:44:53.570 --> 04:44:53.580 align:start position:0%
temporary Docs
 
04:44:56.448 --> 04:44:56.458 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:44:59.930 --> 04:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
I as much as I love the department when
 
04:45:02.150 --> 04:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
we pass legislation I think we should
 
04:45:05.750 --> 04:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
say tighter what we intend and not have
 
04:45:08.690 --> 04:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
rules propagated after the fact that the
 
04:45:08.700 --> 04:45:10.208 align:start position:0%
rules propagated after the fact that the
legislature

04:45:10.208 --> 04:45:10.218 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
04:45:14.208 --> 04:45:14.218 align:start position:0%
does not have the availability to weigh
 
04:45:16.430 --> 04:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
in on so it would be my hope at very
 
04:45:20.510 --> 04:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:23.410 --> 04:45:23.420 align:start position:0%
thank you and could you put in a card
 
04:45:26.690 --> 04:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I would be happy to thank
 
04:45:26.700 --> 04:45:28.368 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I would be happy to thank
you

04:45:28.368 --> 04:45:28.378 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:45:29.690 --> 04:45:29.700 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:45:32.810 --> 04:45:32.820 align:start position:0%
you know just like maybe I I didn't ask
 
04:45:34.970 --> 04:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
the anyone was any members of the
 
04:45:37.670 --> 04:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
committee have a question
 
04:45:39.288 --> 04:45:39.298 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
04:45:39.298 --> 04:45:41.448 align:start position:0%
seeing none
oh

04:45:41.448 --> 04:45:41.458 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:45:44.948 --> 04:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
who's that oh yeah it's representative
 
04:45:48.670 --> 04:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
he was fat he was faster on the
 
04:45:52.550 --> 04:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
drawing my Jeopardy yeah when you were
 
04:45:54.590 --> 04:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
ready you were raising your hand and he
 
04:45:56.690 --> 04:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
had to play his own butt
 
04:45:59.090 --> 04:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
in a letter that we just got from Carol
 
04:46:02.510 --> 04:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
Foss of the Audubon Society she said
 
04:46:03.830 --> 04:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
that the

natural New Hampshire natural heritage
 
04:46:12.230 --> 04:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
Bureau keeps a list of where loans are
 
04:46:15.770 --> 04:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
I'm summarizing the wording in there so
 
04:46:18.110 --> 04:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
it would be relatively simple for
 
04:46:21.470 --> 04:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
somebody to request a check from the
 
04:46:23.628 --> 04:46:23.638 align:start position:0%
natural heritage Bureau before they
 
04:46:25.550 --> 04:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
install their dock
 
04:46:28.788 --> 04:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:30.050 --> 04:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
04:46:32.208 --> 04:46:32.218 align:start position:0%
representative and it's it does sound
 
04:46:35.750 --> 04:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
like an easy process I'm a practitioner
 
04:46:39.288 --> 04:46:39.298 align:start position:0%
I do a lot of Permitting for different
 
04:46:41.270 --> 04:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
things Wetlands Shoreland and everything
 
04:46:41.280 --> 04:46:42.368 align:start position:0%
things Wetlands Shoreland and everything
else

04:46:42.368 --> 04:46:42.378 align:start position:0%
else
 
04:46:45.050 --> 04:46:45.060 align:start position:0%
they it's it
 
04:46:48.590 --> 04:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
there is a website that you go to and
 
04:46:51.590 --> 04:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
you identify as best you can where these
 
04:46:54.230 --> 04:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
things are and you almost immediately
 
04:46:54.240 --> 04:46:55.930 align:start position:0%
things are and you almost immediately
get

04:46:55.930 --> 04:46:55.940 align:start position:0%
get
 
04:46:59.330 --> 04:46:59.340 align:start position:0%
a response that there is something
 
04:47:02.448 --> 04:47:02.458 align:start position:0%
whether it be an invasive species a loon
 
04:47:06.650 --> 04:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
or something and your process stops
 
04:47:09.650 --> 04:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
and then you make application again
 
04:47:11.750 --> 04:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
twenty five dollars and if I remember
 
04:47:13.550 --> 04:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
correctly you have to send that through
 
04:47:15.350 --> 04:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
the mail because that for some reason
 
04:47:18.590 --> 04:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
the state doesn't accept a debit so
 
04:47:23.030 --> 04:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
again we're we're on to it and many many
 
04:47:25.850 --> 04:47:25.860 align:start position:0%
times no adverse effect and then you're
 
04:47:28.190 --> 04:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
then your process works on again
 
04:47:32.410 --> 04:47:32.420 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a time delay
 
04:47:36.830 --> 04:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
if I were if I were asking to and if I
 
04:47:38.690 --> 04:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
could miss chairman
 
04:47:41.330 --> 04:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
um if I were asking to construct a
 
04:47:44.930 --> 04:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
building in the shoreline and the uh a
 
04:47:47.390 --> 04:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
bat population happened to be in the
 
04:47:51.170 --> 04:47:51.180 align:start position:0%
area and after the naturalist comes out
 
04:47:53.448 --> 04:47:53.458 align:start position:0%
and identifies whether there is a bat
 
04:47:55.250 --> 04:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
and I believe fish and game has to come
 
04:47:57.890 --> 04:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
out identify if that loon is still there
 
04:48:00.050 --> 04:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
or that nesting area
 
04:48:02.570 --> 04:48:02.580 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to belittle that the
 
04:48:02.580 --> 04:48:04.490 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to belittle that the
population

04:48:04.490 --> 04:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
population
 
04:48:07.250 --> 04:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
um then on the on the
 
04:48:10.610 --> 04:48:10.620 align:start position:0%
on the bat the long-eared I can't don't
 
04:48:12.708 --> 04:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
know the full name of the bat then
 
04:48:14.330 --> 04:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
you're told to delay all construction
 
04:48:17.090 --> 04:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
for three or four months during whatever
 
04:48:19.850 --> 04:48:19.860 align:start position:0%
the breeding period is and and the time
 
04:48:23.208 --> 04:48:23.218 align:start position:0%
that they're close so if something were
 
04:48:25.310 --> 04:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
going to be done I would like to see
 
04:48:25.320 --> 04:48:27.350 align:start position:0%
going to be done I would like to see
conditions

04:48:27.350 --> 04:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
04:48:31.128 --> 04:48:31.138 align:start position:0%
um permitting in some way but not but
 
04:48:34.490 --> 04:48:34.500 align:start position:0%
not to take the way the right from the I
 
04:48:36.230 --> 04:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
hate to say for the homeowner but if
 
04:48:38.110 --> 04:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
you're on a small pond
 
04:48:41.570 --> 04:48:41.580 align:start position:0%
you severely limit the value of that
 
04:48:43.970 --> 04:48:43.980 align:start position:0%
property if people can't have a
 
04:48:46.250 --> 04:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
temporary Dock and some of these are
 
04:48:49.670 --> 04:48:49.680 align:start position:0%

04:48:54.288 --> 04:48:54.298 align:start position:0%
than representative Darby thank you Mr
 
04:48:55.788 --> 04:48:55.798 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
04:48:57.708 --> 04:48:57.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:48:59.570 --> 04:48:59.580 align:start position:0%
um I want to follow up on a comment you
 
04:49:01.970 --> 04:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
made when you stated you were opposed to
 
04:49:03.890 --> 04:49:03.900 align:start position:0%
this bill because the language was too
 
04:49:07.310 --> 04:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
open and I realized in the title it it
 
04:49:10.310 --> 04:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh or the analysis it mentions Wetlands
 
04:49:12.288 --> 04:49:12.298 align:start position:0%
permitting but in the statute that's
 
04:49:15.470 --> 04:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
being amended it it specifically says
 
04:49:17.868 --> 04:49:17.878 align:start position:0%
lake or Pond and I was wondering do you
 
04:49:20.208 --> 04:49:20.218 align:start position:0%
think that is is that the language it's
 
04:49:22.070 --> 04:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
too open
 
04:49:22.080 --> 04:49:23.510 align:start position:0%
too open
no

04:49:23.510 --> 04:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:49:25.490 --> 04:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
um and I apologize I wasn't planning on
 
04:49:28.850 --> 04:49:28.860 align:start position:0%
sitting here I if I I believe
 
04:49:34.128 --> 04:49:34.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:35.750 --> 04:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I don't have the bill in
 
04:49:37.250 --> 04:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
front of me yeah
 
04:49:39.050 --> 04:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
would you give me a moment too yeah no
 
04:49:40.850 --> 04:49:40.860 align:start position:0%
that's okay and I'm
 
04:49:40.860 --> 04:49:42.110 align:start position:0%
that's okay and I'm
uh

04:49:42.110 --> 04:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:49:44.690 --> 04:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
quickly on line three it states
 
04:49:47.270 --> 04:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
temporary seasonal docs installed on any
 
04:49:49.970 --> 04:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
lake or pond so I was just wondering if
 
04:49:52.128 --> 04:49:52.138 align:start position:0%
if in your opinion that language is too
 
04:49:54.288 --> 04:49:54.298 align:start position:0%
open or if it was some other area of the
 
04:49:57.230 --> 04:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
my thank you representative Mike my my
 
04:50:00.890 --> 04:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
issue was not with that my issue is
 
04:50:04.208 --> 04:50:04.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:09.110 --> 04:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
line 25 number 11. prohibited for being
 
04:50:11.448 --> 04:50:11.458 align:start position:0%
placed in an area that will impact any
 
04:50:14.330 --> 04:50:14.340 align:start position:0%
Wildlife species threatened species or
 
04:50:18.470 --> 04:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
endangered species in accordance with
 
04:50:21.770 --> 04:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
any Wildlife species threatened species
 
04:50:24.170 --> 04:50:24.180 align:start position:0%
indeed I believe that leaves a lot open
 
04:50:26.208 --> 04:50:26.218 align:start position:0%
to interpretation got it and I would
 
04:50:28.190 --> 04:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
like that language tightened up okay
 
04:50:29.990 --> 04:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:50:33.410 --> 04:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
if the representative Darby
 
04:50:34.850 --> 04:50:34.860 align:start position:0%
um just a question are we going to hear
 
04:50:38.270 --> 04:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
from Des do you know uh no
 
04:50:41.570 --> 04:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
they think no okay
 
04:50:41.580 --> 04:50:42.170 align:start position:0%
they think no okay
um

04:50:42.170 --> 04:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:43.788 --> 04:50:43.798 align:start position:0%
so I want to make sure we're talking
 
04:50:46.190 --> 04:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
about the same tool the national natural
 
04:50:48.708 --> 04:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
heritage uh Bureau data check tool
 
04:50:51.890 --> 04:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
because uh we received an email from
 
04:50:55.070 --> 04:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
um commissioner Scott are also referring
 
04:50:57.288 --> 04:50:57.298 align:start position:0%
to the National Heritage Bureau data
 
04:50:58.730 --> 04:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
check tool which said that it was
 
04:51:00.470 --> 04:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
available online and that sounds like a
 
04:51:02.868 --> 04:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
very different process than the one I
 
04:51:04.850 --> 04:51:04.860 align:start position:0%
just heard you describe about sending in
 
04:51:07.490 --> 04:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
25 and having this back and forth and I
 
04:51:08.448 --> 04:51:08.458 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we're talking about
 
04:51:11.030 --> 04:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
the same same tool to be able to access
 
04:51:13.010 --> 04:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
what is you know where the the
 
04:51:15.050 --> 04:51:15.060 align:start position:0%
endangered and Fenton species are thank
 
04:51:18.110 --> 04:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you represent they
 
04:51:20.810 --> 04:51:20.820 align:start position:0%
so you start out you start out in the
 
04:51:24.410 --> 04:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
process by going to the website and
 
04:51:26.208 --> 04:51:26.218 align:start position:0%
finding this tool from the natural
 
04:51:28.610 --> 04:51:28.620 align:start position:0%
heritage that's on there it costs you
 
04:51:32.030 --> 04:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
nothing to start an application so you
 
04:51:35.390 --> 04:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
go in and you either give the
 
04:51:38.270 --> 04:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
coordinates longitude latitude or
 
04:51:41.330 --> 04:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
there's a tool to drop you in on the map
 
04:51:44.570 --> 04:51:44.580 align:start position:0%
and then drop you in by parcel and then
 
04:51:49.190 --> 04:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
you put a dot where where you intend to
 
04:51:50.628 --> 04:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
do your work
 
04:51:53.270 --> 04:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
so you fill out who the owner is what it
 
04:51:56.330 --> 04:51:56.340 align:start position:0%
is you want to do and then you hit send
 
04:52:00.288 --> 04:52:00.298 align:start position:0%
and it goes to the bureau and within a
 
04:52:03.708 --> 04:52:03.718 align:start position:0%
day or two sometimes longer they will
 
04:52:06.470 --> 04:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
report back to you that your project has
 
04:52:10.190 --> 04:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
no impact and you're good to proceed or
 
04:52:13.850 --> 04:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
you will get a hit that says it appears
 
04:52:17.930 --> 04:52:17.940 align:start position:0%
we have something in that area and
 
04:52:19.610 --> 04:52:19.620 align:start position:0%
they'll give you a list that it could be
 
04:52:24.010 --> 04:52:24.020 align:start position:0%
anything from a specialty grass to
 
04:52:27.948 --> 04:52:27.958 align:start position:0%
an endangered species
 
04:52:31.190 --> 04:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be and it'll say that
 
04:52:33.708 --> 04:52:33.718 align:start position:0%
you cannot move forward until further
 
04:52:36.410 --> 04:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
investigation is done and to move
 
04:52:39.550 --> 04:52:39.560 align:start position:0%
forward you I believe the fees 25
 
04:52:42.470 --> 04:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
you need to continue on your application
 
04:52:46.128 --> 04:52:46.138 align:start position:0%
send them 25 dollars through the U.S
 
04:52:49.250 --> 04:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
mail and once they receive receipt of
 
04:52:53.448 --> 04:52:53.458 align:start position:0%
that then they will Churn it to whomever
 
04:52:57.590 --> 04:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
they need to to go investigate that
 
04:53:00.170 --> 04:53:00.180 align:start position:0%
thanks very much
 
04:53:00.180 --> 04:53:01.850 align:start position:0%

04:53:42.840 --> 04:53:45.610 align:start position:0%
doing we're on 274.
nothing

04:53:45.610 --> 04:53:45.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:50.690 --> 04:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
72. 472 because the next bill is 247. so
 
04:53:53.510 --> 04:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
I said I don't know
 
04:53:57.590 --> 04:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so we have we have no uh no further
 
04:54:00.230 --> 04:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
pink cards on this bill that will close
 
04:54:01.730 --> 04:54:01.740 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
04:54:03.110 --> 04:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
and we're
 
04:54:06.410 --> 04:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
we'll start again on the next airing at
 
04:54:09.890 --> 04:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
two o'clock oh I've got five minutes
 
04:54:13.430 --> 04:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
oh we're late oh I'm sorry I'm still

okay let's and then we start again we'll
 
04:54:21.250 --> 04:54:21.260 align:start position:0%
start on uh house bill
 
04:54:26.090 --> 04:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:26.100 --> 04:54:27.708 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:54:41.700 --> 04:54:51.850 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:54:51.850 --> 04:54:51.860 align:start position:0%

representative wolf
 
04:54:56.750 --> 04:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh we're in we're in session
 
04:54:56.760 --> 04:54:58.250 align:start position:0%
uh we're in we're in session
uh

04:54:58.250 --> 04:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:55:02.110 --> 04:55:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:05.448 --> 04:55:05.458 align:start position:0%
again I apologize and I apologize again
 
04:55:07.190 --> 04:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
for calling
 
04:55:10.550 --> 04:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
calling a slate
 
04:55:13.850 --> 04:55:13.860 align:start position:0%
yeah you do you believe me take your
 
04:55:13.860 --> 04:55:20.628 align:start position:0%
yeah you do you believe me take your
time

04:55:20.628 --> 04:55:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:20.638 --> 04:55:29.330 align:start position:0%
 
47.

04:55:29.330 --> 04:55:29.340 align:start position:0%

Senator McConkey

04:55:33.670 --> 04:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
247
 
04:55:38.208 --> 04:55:38.218 align:start position:0%
relative to protective well radii
 
04:55:41.510 --> 04:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
the floor is yours thank you Mr chairman
 
04:55:43.670 --> 04:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's still a pleasure to be before you
 
04:55:43.680 --> 04:55:45.050 align:start position:0%
it's still a pleasure to be before you
folks

04:55:45.050 --> 04:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
folks
 
04:55:48.310 --> 04:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
the I am the prime sponsor of House Bill
 
04:55:48.320 --> 04:55:49.990 align:start position:0%
the I am the prime sponsor of House Bill
247

04:55:49.990 --> 04:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
247
 
04:55:52.610 --> 04:55:52.620 align:start position:0%
which is a bill removes the encroachment
 
04:55:55.730 --> 04:55:55.740 align:start position:0%
waivers uh required using a setback
 
04:55:58.368 --> 04:55:58.378 align:start position:0%
reduction form and remove certain
 
04:56:00.830 --> 04:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
requirements of an amended septic system
 
04:56:00.840 --> 04:56:02.330 align:start position:0%
requirements of an amended septic system
plan

04:56:02.330 --> 04:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
plan
 
04:56:05.390 --> 04:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to grab a little I worked
 
04:56:07.550 --> 04:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
extensively with uh
 
04:56:10.250 --> 04:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
04:56:12.830 --> 04:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
department environmental services worked
 
04:56:15.650 --> 04:56:15.660 align:start position:0%
with the Attorney General's office to
 
04:56:17.868 --> 04:56:17.878 align:start position:0%
craft the language that you see before
 
04:56:17.878 --> 04:56:19.128 align:start position:0%
craft the language that you see before
you

04:56:19.128 --> 04:56:19.138 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:56:20.690 --> 04:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
I might steal a little bit of the
 
04:56:22.610 --> 04:56:22.620 align:start position:0%
Thunder here on what they have and I'm
 
04:56:25.128 --> 04:56:25.138 align:start position:0%
going to defer most of the questions uh
 
04:56:28.490 --> 04:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
Mr Robert and the department that's here
 
04:56:31.550 --> 04:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
but this this proposal would clarify and
 
04:56:34.250 --> 04:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
streamline the process regarding the
 
04:56:36.610 --> 04:56:36.620 align:start position:0%
protective radii around
 
04:56:39.410 --> 04:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
private Wells radius as I would refer to
 
04:56:42.530 --> 04:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
it it would eliminate the provision for
 
04:56:44.930 --> 04:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
an encroachment waiver which is
 
04:56:46.910 --> 04:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
redundant with deeded easements and
 
04:56:48.050 --> 04:56:48.060 align:start position:0%
rarely used
 
04:56:50.628 --> 04:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
and add more flexibility regarding
 
04:56:53.510 --> 04:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
monitoring requirements simplifying
 
04:56:53.520 --> 04:56:54.910 align:start position:0%
monitoring requirements simplifying
reporting

04:56:54.910 --> 04:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
04:56:57.590 --> 04:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
requirements and clarify ambiguous
 
04:57:01.250 --> 04:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
sections of the statute
 
04:57:03.708 --> 04:57:03.718 align:start position:0%
I had mentioned in the previous
 
04:57:09.830 --> 04:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
testimony that I am a practitioner in
 
04:57:11.690 --> 04:57:11.700 align:start position:0%
environmental permitting
 
04:57:13.810 --> 04:57:13.820 align:start position:0%
I have
 
04:57:16.150 --> 04:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
been permitted
 
04:57:19.430 --> 04:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
to design septic systems installed in
 
04:57:24.410 --> 04:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
septic systems for nearly 30 years I run
 
04:57:26.930 --> 04:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
a family business and my two sons also
 
04:57:29.510 --> 04:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
hold all the same permits
 
04:57:33.110 --> 04:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
up in the north country where I am I
 
04:57:34.788 --> 04:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say North because North is
 
04:57:36.708 --> 04:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
much further north than me I'm in
 
04:57:39.050 --> 04:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
Freedom the Conway area
 
04:57:41.570 --> 04:57:41.580 align:start position:0%
I know they take exception if I saved
 
04:57:44.628 --> 04:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
North Country so I apologize the
 
04:57:48.110 --> 04:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
um we have a lot of lots that were
 
04:57:51.890 --> 04:57:51.900 align:start position:0%
subdivided prior to the enactment of
 
04:57:55.368 --> 04:57:55.378 align:start position:0%
State regulation we have a lot of tiny
 
04:57:55.378 --> 04:57:56.570 align:start position:0%
State regulation we have a lot of tiny
Lots

04:57:56.570 --> 04:57:56.580 align:start position:0%
Lots
 
04:58:01.190 --> 04:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh 50 feet by 50 feet and so forth and
 
04:58:03.350 --> 04:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
many of those lots that were created
 
04:58:07.368 --> 04:58:07.378 align:start position:0%
before the time of subdivision and
 
04:58:09.470 --> 04:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
before the regulation of departmental
 
04:58:14.030 --> 04:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
services even today are still allowed to
 
04:58:17.930 --> 04:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
have a septic system no larger than two
 
04:58:20.570 --> 04:58:20.580 align:start position:0%
bedroom or or
 
04:58:23.110 --> 04:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
300 gallons a day
 
04:58:25.850 --> 04:58:25.860 align:start position:0%
providing and then the list starts
 
04:58:28.930 --> 04:58:28.940 align:start position:0%
providing there's sufficient soil
 
04:58:33.050 --> 04:58:33.060 align:start position:0%
providing that and the well radius now
 
04:58:35.150 --> 04:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
becomes an issue
 
04:58:39.350 --> 04:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
so Wells that were drilled before 1989
 
04:58:42.230 --> 04:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
if if my sheet of paper and I won't use
 
04:58:44.350 --> 04:58:44.360 align:start position:0%
it as a prop but if my sheet of paper
 
04:58:46.970 --> 04:58:46.980 align:start position:0%
were the size of my lot and it had
 
04:58:49.190 --> 04:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
dimensions of 50 feet along the water
 
04:58:53.510 --> 04:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
and 75 back or 50 back and I was the
 
04:58:56.390 --> 04:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
first one in the area what I would do or
 
04:58:58.310 --> 04:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
what most of them did was they'd put
 
04:59:00.708 --> 04:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
their house in the middle they'd put
 
04:59:02.750 --> 04:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
their septic system in the front or
 
04:59:05.208 --> 04:59:05.218 align:start position:0%
backyard and they would put their well
 
04:59:08.208 --> 04:59:08.218 align:start position:0%
as far away from their own septic system
 
04:59:09.708 --> 04:59:09.718 align:start position:0%
that they could
 
04:59:11.868 --> 04:59:11.878 align:start position:0%
now back then many of the systems
 
04:59:14.390 --> 04:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
weren't regulated so that seemed like a
 
04:59:17.208 --> 04:59:17.218 align:start position:0%
great idea to that homeowner the problem
 
04:59:19.670 --> 04:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
comes when the neighbor came along next
 
04:59:22.910 --> 04:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
door or now when inventory is down and
 
04:59:24.830 --> 04:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
there's so few lots and I'm looking for
 
04:59:26.410 --> 04:59:26.420 align:start position:0%
a place to be
 
04:59:31.250 --> 04:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
the rule was that if your
 
04:59:34.070 --> 04:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
your radius was not completely contained
 
04:59:37.368 --> 04:59:37.378 align:start position:0%
on your property and you wanted to get
 
04:59:39.830 --> 04:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
closer to your neighbor
 
04:59:42.470 --> 04:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
you had to get an encroachment waiver
 
04:59:45.470 --> 04:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
they had to agree that I could put my
 
04:59:46.868 --> 04:59:46.878 align:start position:0%
septic system
 
04:59:51.110 --> 04:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
closer to your well than than what's
 
04:59:53.930 --> 04:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
allowed today and many homeowners I've
 
04:59:55.788 --> 04:59:55.798 align:start position:0%
run into it probably no less than a
 
04:59:58.910 --> 04:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
hundred times would come out and say I'd
 
05:00:00.650 --> 05:00:00.660 align:start position:0%
love to have you for a neighbor but I'm
 
05:00:04.128 --> 05:00:04.138 align:start position:0%
not signing that document
 
05:00:07.250 --> 05:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
today's world in the design and install
 
05:00:10.390 --> 05:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
of septic system in
 
05:00:14.090 --> 05:00:14.100 align:start position:0%
2023 is an extremely different process
 
05:00:18.050 --> 05:00:18.060 align:start position:0%
than it was in 1987 and you have to have
 
05:00:20.270 --> 05:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
permitted people determine what the
 
05:00:23.150 --> 05:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
soils are and in some of these instances
 
05:00:25.670 --> 05:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
where it's so small the Department of
 
05:00:27.470 --> 05:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services would like to see
 
05:00:30.530 --> 05:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
pre-treatment done and by pre-treatment
 
05:00:33.350 --> 05:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
it's taking nitrates and phosphates out
 
05:00:36.110 --> 05:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
and it's protecting that well next door
 
05:00:38.150 --> 05:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
and it's also protecting your well-being
 
05:00:40.250 --> 05:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
close by
 
05:00:40.260 --> 05:00:41.628 align:start position:0%
close by
so

05:00:41.628 --> 05:00:41.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:00:44.690 --> 05:00:44.700 align:start position:0%
this bill we talked about it last year
 
05:00:46.850 --> 05:00:46.860 align:start position:0%
it was trailered on to another bill and
 
05:00:48.850 --> 05:00:48.860 align:start position:0%
by the time it made it to the Senate
 
05:00:51.650 --> 05:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
they thought it should stand on its own
 
05:00:53.810 --> 05:00:53.820 align:start position:0%
so that's that's why we're back here
 
05:00:56.868 --> 05:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
today there will also be people uh
 
05:01:00.170 --> 05:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
besides septic uh professionals I
 
05:01:02.150 --> 05:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
believe the water well board and others
 
05:01:04.610 --> 05:01:04.620 align:start position:0%
are to follow me and
 
05:01:07.070 --> 05:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
05:01:10.670 --> 05:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
and I would probably defer a lot of why
 
05:01:12.890 --> 05:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
we need to do this because it benefits
 
05:01:16.430 --> 05:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
well people also well drillers and how
 
05:01:18.948 --> 05:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
they report but I'm happy to take
 
05:01:21.650 --> 05:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
questions at this juncture if if that
 
05:01:26.628 --> 05:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:28.730 --> 05:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
there any questions by members of the
 
05:01:28.740 --> 05:01:33.288 align:start position:0%
there any questions by members of the
committee

05:01:33.288 --> 05:01:33.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:40.550 --> 05:01:40.560 align:start position:0%

05:02:17.270 --> 05:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
it's a good afternoon chairman renzulo
 
05:02:18.770 --> 05:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh for the record I'm Philip Trowbridge
 
05:02:22.670 --> 05:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
administrator of the land resource
 
05:02:24.650 --> 05:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
management program at New Hampshire des
 
05:02:26.930 --> 05:02:26.940 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the opportunity to
 
05:02:30.770 --> 05:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
testify regarding House Bill 247 and the
 
05:02:32.570 --> 05:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
department supports this bill and
 
05:02:34.430 --> 05:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
sitting with me today is Brandon Kernan
 
05:02:35.750 --> 05:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
who's the administrator of the
 
05:02:37.490 --> 05:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
groundwater drinking water groundwater
 
05:02:39.948 --> 05:02:39.958 align:start position:0%
Bureau of the uh since this bill deals
 
05:02:40.910 --> 05:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
with both
 
05:02:42.890 --> 05:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
septic system permitting as well as
 
05:02:46.070 --> 05:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:48.770 --> 05:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
so just by way of some background a
 
05:02:50.770 --> 05:02:50.780 align:start position:0%
protective well radius is the circle
 
05:02:53.448 --> 05:02:53.458 align:start position:0%
around a well representing the area from
 
05:02:55.510 --> 05:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
which the water is drawn into the well
 
05:02:58.070 --> 05:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
typically for a private well for
 
05:03:01.930 --> 05:03:01.940 align:start position:0%
residents it's 75 feet radius
 
05:03:04.610 --> 05:03:04.620 align:start position:0%
and this build build deals with these
 
05:03:07.550 --> 05:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
situations where that radius extends off
 
05:03:10.368 --> 05:03:10.378 align:start position:0%
of the lot on which the well exists so
 
05:03:12.890 --> 05:03:12.900 align:start position:0%
it goes from the lot where someone owns
 
05:03:15.948 --> 05:03:15.958 align:start position:0%
a well onto someone else's lot
 
05:03:18.288 --> 05:03:18.298 align:start position:0%
um Des worked with representative
 
05:03:20.868 --> 05:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
McConkey the water well board
 
05:03:23.448 --> 05:03:23.458 align:start position:0%
the water well contractors septic system
 
05:03:25.788 --> 05:03:25.798 align:start position:0%
designers and septic system installers
 
05:03:28.368 --> 05:03:28.378 align:start position:0%
on this bill because the current statute
 
05:03:31.128 --> 05:03:31.138 align:start position:0%
is very hard to implement
 
05:03:32.750 --> 05:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
and it really could be streamlined
 
05:03:35.150 --> 05:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
without reducing without increasing any
 
05:03:37.250 --> 05:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
risks to Public Health of the
 
05:03:37.260 --> 05:03:39.170 align:start position:0%
risks to Public Health of the
environment

05:03:39.170 --> 05:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
environment
 
05:03:40.970 --> 05:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
so to help you understand the bill I've
 
05:03:43.070 --> 05:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
attached some slides to the letter of
 
05:03:45.410 --> 05:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
testimony that you all should have they
 
05:03:47.810 --> 05:03:47.820 align:start position:0%
they illustrate some of these situations
 
05:03:51.110 --> 05:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
where the well radius crosses lot lines
 
05:03:53.810 --> 05:03:53.820 align:start position:0%
and tries to avoid overlap with houses
 
05:03:56.270 --> 05:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
and septic systems
 
05:04:00.050 --> 05:04:00.060 align:start position:0%
and the the testimony letter also has a
 
05:04:02.930 --> 05:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
fair amount of detail as to why the
 
05:04:05.090 --> 05:04:05.100 align:start position:0%
department supports the bill
 
05:04:08.750 --> 05:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
but for the purpose of brevity today I'm
 
05:04:10.670 --> 05:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
going to just highlight three issues and
 
05:04:13.490 --> 05:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
then we can get into questions
 
05:04:13.500 --> 05:04:14.270 align:start position:0%
then we can get into questions
um

05:04:14.270 --> 05:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:16.368 --> 05:04:16.378 align:start position:0%
first and I think foremost it's
 
05:04:18.230 --> 05:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
important to understand that both the
 
05:04:22.310 --> 05:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
rsas and Court decisions have
 
05:04:23.990 --> 05:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
established that the portion of a
 
05:04:26.810 --> 05:04:26.820 align:start position:0%
private well radius that extends off of
 
05:04:30.890 --> 05:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
the well owners lot is not protected
 
05:04:33.288 --> 05:04:33.298 align:start position:0%
it can't be used to prevent development
 
05:04:35.150 --> 05:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
of that other lot
 
05:04:37.430 --> 05:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
because that would be a takings from the
 
05:04:39.590 --> 05:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
owner of that other lot
 
05:04:41.990 --> 05:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately though one really has
 
05:04:43.910 --> 05:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
to read between the lines in the statute
 
05:04:47.330 --> 05:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
and understand the case law to know that
 
05:04:49.970 --> 05:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
and we've handled lots of questions from
 
05:04:52.390 --> 05:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
people who are calling us
 
05:04:55.368 --> 05:04:55.378 align:start position:0%
and are confused by it so one of our
 
05:04:56.690 --> 05:04:56.700 align:start position:0%
major goals is just to have some
 
05:04:59.208 --> 05:04:59.218 align:start position:0%
affirmative language that landowners can
 
05:05:01.250 --> 05:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
cannot read and understand their rights
 
05:05:04.670 --> 05:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:07.670 --> 05:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
a second major goal is to reduce
 
05:05:10.250 --> 05:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
redundant reporting requirements
 
05:05:12.110 --> 05:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
right now when we have one of these
 
05:05:14.810 --> 05:05:14.820 align:start position:0%
situations with a well radius that goes
 
05:05:16.970 --> 05:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
off the lot up to three different
 
05:05:18.890 --> 05:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
reports need to be filed with two
 
05:05:21.410 --> 05:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
different sections of Des some of which
 
05:05:23.208 --> 05:05:23.218 align:start position:0%
need to be reported recorded with the
 
05:05:25.190 --> 05:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
registry of deeds some of which need to
 
05:05:28.250 --> 05:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
be signed by the abutting landowner
 
05:05:30.708 --> 05:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
um really ultimately this can be
 
05:05:32.390 --> 05:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
simplified to one report
 
05:05:34.208 --> 05:05:34.218 align:start position:0%
it's called the setback reduction form
 
05:05:36.830 --> 05:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
which the water well contractors are
 
05:05:38.090 --> 05:05:38.100 align:start position:0%
already required under a different
 
05:05:41.090 --> 05:05:41.100 align:start position:0%
statute to file with des and that we
 
05:05:46.390 --> 05:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:50.628 --> 05:05:50.638 align:start position:0%
uh third major change is to remove a
 
05:05:52.490 --> 05:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
requirement to get an amended septic
 
05:05:55.128 --> 05:05:55.138 align:start position:0%
plan if the well location needs to be
 
05:05:55.138 --> 05:05:56.270 align:start position:0%
plan if the well location needs to be
moved

05:05:56.270 --> 05:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
moved
 
05:05:58.910 --> 05:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
so water well contractors have the
 
05:06:01.070 --> 05:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
option to decide to move where they put
 
05:06:03.410 --> 05:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
the well if they get on site and they
 
05:06:04.970 --> 05:06:04.980 align:start position:0%
find that they can't get to the approved
 
05:06:04.980 --> 05:06:05.930 align:start position:0%
find that they can't get to the approved
location

05:06:05.930 --> 05:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
location
 
05:06:07.190 --> 05:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
you know I think we could all imagine
 
05:06:09.288 --> 05:06:09.298 align:start position:0%
circumstances where we've got a plan and
 
05:06:11.628 --> 05:06:11.638 align:start position:0%
it says put the well here but there may
 
05:06:13.310 --> 05:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
be a steep slope or there may be power
 
05:06:16.390 --> 05:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
lines or a really large tree
 
05:06:20.270 --> 05:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
or something else and so they have the
 
05:06:21.770 --> 05:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
ability to say you know we can't go here
 
05:06:23.628 --> 05:06:23.638 align:start position:0%
but we can go here
 
05:06:27.890 --> 05:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
and right now under the statute the
 
05:06:30.110 --> 05:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
homeowner would then have to
 
05:06:33.288 --> 05:06:33.298 align:start position:0%
rehire a septic system designer for a
 
05:06:34.550 --> 05:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
second time
 
05:06:36.708 --> 05:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
to amend their septic plan to show the
 
05:06:39.708 --> 05:06:39.718 align:start position:0%
new location of the well
 
05:06:39.718 --> 05:06:40.490 align:start position:0%
new location of the well
um

05:06:40.490 --> 05:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:40.500 --> 05:06:41.930 align:start position:0%
um
the

05:06:41.930 --> 05:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:06:44.030 --> 05:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
getting this this amendment really just
 
05:06:47.090 --> 05:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
adds cost and time but not protection
 
05:06:49.970 --> 05:06:49.980 align:start position:0%
because the water well contractors use
 
05:06:51.890 --> 05:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
in these cases where they might have to
 
05:06:54.170 --> 05:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
move the well they use these what are
 
05:06:55.628 --> 05:06:55.638 align:start position:0%
called special methods of construction
 
05:06:58.430 --> 05:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
which is like extra casing and grouting
 
05:07:00.410 --> 05:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
and sealing of the well that's been
 
05:07:02.750 --> 05:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
approved by the Water Well board to to
 
05:07:04.730 --> 05:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
install the well safe leave and if it
 
05:07:07.670 --> 05:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
has to be perhaps closer to the septic
 
05:07:09.708 --> 05:07:09.718 align:start position:0%
system than was originally approved
 
05:07:11.990 --> 05:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
so really doing this amended septic plan
 
05:07:14.750 --> 05:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
is just a paper exercise after the fact
 
05:07:16.850 --> 05:07:16.860 align:start position:0%
it's on the homeowner's responsibility
 
05:07:19.128 --> 05:07:19.138 align:start position:0%
to hire someone to do it they have to
 
05:07:22.070 --> 05:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
pay them a second time and oftentimes
 
05:07:24.230 --> 05:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
they fail to do that and put themselves
 
05:07:28.730 --> 05:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:31.970 --> 05:07:31.980 align:start position:0%
so in summary we support this bill
 
05:07:34.670 --> 05:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
because it first off removes removes
 
05:07:36.350 --> 05:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
confusion about the protections for
 
05:07:37.670 --> 05:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
private Wells
 
05:07:40.190 --> 05:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
when the radius goes off lot
 
05:07:42.650 --> 05:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
streamlines the reporting process
 
05:07:44.510 --> 05:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
and it eliminates this unnecessary
 
05:07:47.690 --> 05:07:47.700 align:start position:0%
requirement for an amended septic plan
 
05:07:51.050 --> 05:07:51.060 align:start position:0%
all in all this saves landowners and
 
05:07:53.650 --> 05:07:53.660 align:start position:0%
contractors time and money without
 
05:07:56.030 --> 05:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
affecting property rights or increasing
 
05:07:56.040 --> 05:07:57.590 align:start position:0%
affecting property rights or increasing
risks

05:07:57.590 --> 05:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
risks
 
05:07:59.448 --> 05:07:59.458 align:start position:0%
so we we thank you for this opportunity
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure you'll have questions and
 
05:08:04.850 --> 05:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:07.190 --> 05:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
05:08:07.200 --> 05:08:09.770 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
committee

05:08:09.770 --> 05:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:08:11.990 --> 05:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative wrong thank you Mr chair
 
05:08:14.390 --> 05:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question on
 
05:08:18.050 --> 05:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
line 24 of the bill it it references the
 
05:08:20.810 --> 05:08:20.820 align:start position:0%
water well contractor and I was
 
05:08:23.868 --> 05:08:23.878 align:start position:0%
wondering is there does Des certify this
 
05:08:26.448 --> 05:08:26.458 align:start position:0%
type of a position or their standards
 
05:08:28.788 --> 05:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
they have to can anybody be a water well
 
05:08:28.798 --> 05:08:30.830 align:start position:0%
they have to can anybody be a water well
contractor

05:08:30.830 --> 05:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
05:08:31.970 --> 05:08:31.980 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative everyone
 
05:08:33.948 --> 05:08:33.958 align:start position:0%
could you specify which page oh I'm
 
05:08:36.890 --> 05:08:36.900 align:start position:0%
sorry it's on page one page one okay
 
05:08:40.190 --> 05:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
line 24. yeah
 
05:08:41.448 --> 05:08:41.458 align:start position:0%
yeah uh and Brandon maybe you should
 
05:08:42.770 --> 05:08:42.780 align:start position:0%
answer that
 
05:08:46.010 --> 05:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
yes um in Statue it's established that
 
05:08:48.128 --> 05:08:48.138 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
05:08:50.330 --> 05:08:50.340 align:start position:0%
helps administer the water well board
 
05:08:52.550 --> 05:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
there's a water well board which is a
 
05:08:55.490 --> 05:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
board of appointed members that um
 
05:08:57.230 --> 05:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
oversee licensing of water well
 
05:08:58.730 --> 05:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
contractors and different type of Wells
 
05:09:00.650 --> 05:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
as well as pump installation
 
05:09:04.070 --> 05:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay follow up Mr chair for a follow-up
 
05:09:06.830 --> 05:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
so so it's safe to assume that when I
 
05:09:09.170 --> 05:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
see water well contractor that it is
 
05:09:10.430 --> 05:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
someone who's met the licensing
 
05:09:12.230 --> 05:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
requirements of the state
 
05:09:14.270 --> 05:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
yes and in fact you know where the board
 
05:09:16.850 --> 05:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
is very active and cracking down on any
 
05:09:18.410 --> 05:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
entity that might be operating without
 
05:09:20.390 --> 05:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
the appropriate license okay thank you
 
05:09:23.750 --> 05:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:26.030 --> 05:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
 
05:09:26.040 --> 05:09:28.190 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
committee

05:09:28.190 --> 05:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:09:28.200 --> 05:09:31.550 align:start position:0%
committee
oh

05:09:31.550 --> 05:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:31.560 --> 05:09:35.890 align:start position:0%
 
I

05:09:35.890 --> 05:09:35.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:39.050 --> 05:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
apologize for being such a big mouth but
 
05:09:41.330 --> 05:09:41.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for all right Mr chair
 
05:09:42.470 --> 05:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for taking my question
 
05:09:42.480 --> 05:09:43.670 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for taking my question
just

05:09:43.670 --> 05:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:09:43.680 --> 05:09:45.650 align:start position:0%
just
um

05:09:45.650 --> 05:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:47.330 --> 05:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand what the
 
05:09:51.410 --> 05:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
original intent of these um of these uh
 
05:09:53.510 --> 05:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
encroachment waivers were it basically
 
05:09:58.330 --> 05:09:58.340 align:start position:0%
is hey I want to move my well on my land
 
05:10:01.368 --> 05:10:01.378 align:start position:0%
but now my
 
05:10:04.190 --> 05:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
um my radius would
 
05:10:06.530 --> 05:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
um require would basically go onto your
 
05:10:08.030 --> 05:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
property so I need you to approve that
 
05:10:10.550 --> 05:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
and then my neighbor says
 
05:10:12.948 --> 05:10:12.958 align:start position:0%
yes or no is that was that the idea like
 
05:10:14.930 --> 05:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
to sort of guarantee that they have
 
05:10:14.940 --> 05:10:17.090 align:start position:0%
to sort of guarantee that they have
protection

05:10:17.090 --> 05:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
protection
 
05:10:20.330 --> 05:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Darby uh yes
 
05:10:22.670 --> 05:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
I went back to when this bill was or
 
05:10:23.990 --> 05:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
when the statue was originally created
 
05:10:26.030 --> 05:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
in 1989
 
05:10:27.590 --> 05:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:10:29.810 --> 05:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
um the intent was about the encroachment
 
05:10:32.150 --> 05:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
of the well on the neighbor
 
05:10:34.368 --> 05:10:34.378 align:start position:0%
um and to say that if you were
 
05:10:37.310 --> 05:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
you know wanted to basically have your
 
05:10:39.890 --> 05:10:39.900 align:start position:0%
well radius go off of the laws but you
 
05:10:42.890 --> 05:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
wanted to control what could happen in
 
05:10:44.690 --> 05:10:44.700 align:start position:0%
that area that was off the lot then you
 
05:10:46.430 --> 05:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
needed to get a sign up from your
 
05:10:48.650 --> 05:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
neighbor agreeing essentially that they
 
05:10:51.530 --> 05:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
wouldn't put their septic system or you
 
05:10:53.288 --> 05:10:53.298 align:start position:0%
know parking area or something there
 
05:10:56.270 --> 05:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
over time it kind of shifted
 
05:10:59.868 --> 05:10:59.878 align:start position:0%
to be the opposite of the well radius
 
05:11:02.150 --> 05:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
goes across the lot and you know now
 
05:11:03.590 --> 05:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's a question of the septic system
 
05:11:06.770 --> 05:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
encroaching on it and really the point
 
05:11:08.690 --> 05:11:08.700 align:start position:0%
here is to clarify that and bring it
 
05:11:14.090 --> 05:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:16.010 --> 05:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
 
05:11:16.020 --> 05:11:19.010 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
committee

05:11:19.010 --> 05:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:21.050 --> 05:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
saying none
 
05:11:23.330 --> 05:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:11:30.050 --> 05:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:33.350 --> 05:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
dear recognizes
 
05:11:35.330 --> 05:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
is that Chris Albert
 
05:11:39.230 --> 05:11:39.240 align:start position:0%

05:11:39.240 --> 05:11:40.368 align:start position:0%
oh okay representing granite state on
site

05:11:40.368 --> 05:11:40.378 align:start position:0%
site
 
05:11:43.970 --> 05:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:04.788 --> 05:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:11.868 --> 05:12:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:15.410 --> 05:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
all right yep thank you chairman renzel
 
05:12:17.868 --> 05:12:17.878 align:start position:0%
uh the committee rrd it's been a long
 
05:12:20.090 --> 05:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
time since I've been here uh again Chris
 
05:12:21.948 --> 05:12:21.958 align:start position:0%
Albert I'm for the record I'm chairman
 
05:12:25.430 --> 05:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
of the Granite State rural uh uh Waters
 
05:12:27.708 --> 05:12:27.718 align:start position:0%
uh granite state on site was Association
 
05:12:31.368 --> 05:12:31.378 align:start position:0%
formerly gsdi uh very cumbersome with
 
05:12:34.550 --> 05:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
our new name but we rebranded uh this is
 
05:12:36.590 --> 05:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
an instrumental bill this is very
 
05:12:38.868 --> 05:12:38.878 align:start position:0%
important for us if you look at the
 
05:12:41.390 --> 05:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
second page that we sent that's kind of
 
05:12:44.628 --> 05:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
a typical uh septic replacement that we
 
05:12:47.510 --> 05:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
have to deal with uh with well radius is
 
05:12:51.288 --> 05:12:51.298 align:start position:0%
overlapping uh uh this is a great bill
 
05:12:52.788 --> 05:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
as as far as it's it's more of a
 
05:12:54.830 --> 05:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
clerical bill as far as clearing up the
 
05:12:57.288 --> 05:12:57.298 align:start position:0%
pre-89 Post 89 status
 
05:13:00.350 --> 05:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh the encroachment waiver process the
 
05:13:02.448 --> 05:13:02.458 align:start position:0%
recorded well-released documents that
 
05:13:04.610 --> 05:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
we've had to do over the years doesn't
 
05:13:07.850 --> 05:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
work it takes time uh I deal with a lot
 
05:13:10.910 --> 05:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
of small lot septic designs Replacements
 
05:13:15.650 --> 05:13:15.660 align:start position:0%
that are failed uh that causes delays on
 
05:13:18.470 --> 05:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:18.480 --> 05:13:19.750 align:start position:0%
 
again

05:13:19.750 --> 05:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:13:22.190 --> 05:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
as far as an environmental perspective
 
05:13:24.590 --> 05:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
this bill won't cause any environmental
 
05:13:26.930 --> 05:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
issues we're in very supportive of this
 
05:13:29.270 --> 05:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
bill it's long overdue and again it's
 
05:13:32.150 --> 05:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
pretty much a clerical uh upgrade to the
 
05:13:34.070 --> 05:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
current law again I don't know if
 
05:13:35.510 --> 05:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
there's any attorneys in the room but
 
05:13:37.070 --> 05:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
again it was an attorney interpretation
 
05:13:39.050 --> 05:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
over the years that's kind of Dennis to
 
05:13:40.970 --> 05:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
this point right now so hopefully this
 
05:13:46.128 --> 05:13:46.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:49.010 --> 05:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
is there any questions by members of the
 
05:13:49.020 --> 05:13:52.368 align:start position:0%
is there any questions by members of the
committee

05:13:52.368 --> 05:13:52.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:54.830 --> 05:13:54.840 align:start position:0%

throughout the state uh this is my 44th
 
05:14:46.010 --> 05:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
year 45th year doing this
 
05:14:48.050 --> 05:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
um we employed 23 people in New
 
05:14:51.230 --> 05:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our industry is usually
 
05:14:53.570 --> 05:14:53.580 align:start position:0%
family-run businesses we don't have any
 
05:14:55.670 --> 05:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
conglomerates have tried to
 
05:14:58.190 --> 05:14:58.200 align:start position:0%
to you know organize our whole industry
 
05:15:00.708 --> 05:15:00.718 align:start position:0%
I've been involved with the licensing
 
05:15:03.610 --> 05:15:03.620 align:start position:0%
since it started in 84.
 
05:15:06.350 --> 05:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
and I will say that this whole program
 
05:15:08.628 --> 05:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
with this going through this this
 
05:15:11.930 --> 05:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
process right now has been wonderful
 
05:15:15.110 --> 05:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
um unlike in pastimes when we were told
 
05:15:17.270 --> 05:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
how far to put Wells and where to put
 
05:15:21.530 --> 05:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
them it came very from the top down and
 
05:15:23.510 --> 05:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
we're the last ones to know this time
 
05:15:26.510 --> 05:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
has had really good Outreach sought our
 
05:15:26.520 --> 05:15:27.948 align:start position:0%
has had really good Outreach sought our
support

05:15:27.948 --> 05:15:27.958 align:start position:0%
support
 
05:15:29.868 --> 05:15:29.878 align:start position:0%
um it's it's really welcomed in our
 
05:15:32.868 --> 05:15:32.878 align:start position:0%
industry we have had a couple meetings
 
05:15:35.510 --> 05:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
about with us about this we're all
 
05:15:38.690 --> 05:15:38.700 align:start position:0%
supportive of it it offers us Clarity
 
05:15:41.110 --> 05:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
and the best thing it does without
 
05:15:43.730 --> 05:15:43.740 align:start position:0%
encroaching on environmental or
 
05:15:46.850 --> 05:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
landowner rights it cuts red tape and
 
05:15:48.530 --> 05:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
that's a the winning thing right there
 
05:15:51.350 --> 05:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
again today how many calls we feel from
 
05:15:53.990 --> 05:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
Wells that were put in earlier where
 
05:15:55.670 --> 05:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
they put in before you had to release
 
05:15:58.610 --> 05:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
form were they registered with the Deeds
 
05:16:01.190 --> 05:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
I can't find it was it previous
 
05:16:03.890 --> 05:16:03.900 align:start position:0%
legislation or after this legislation
 
05:16:07.430 --> 05:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
and it has really provided clarity
 
05:16:09.708 --> 05:16:09.718 align:start position:0%
our industry we have special
 
05:16:11.628 --> 05:16:11.638 align:start position:0%
construction methods that have been
 
05:16:14.270 --> 05:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
adopted by the board we're putting
 
05:16:16.970 --> 05:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
additional casing in not only because of
 
05:16:18.770 --> 05:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
encroachment issues but you may have
 
05:16:21.708 --> 05:16:21.718 align:start position:0%
contamination issues contamination can
 
05:16:25.570 --> 05:16:25.580 align:start position:0%
be if we've all heard of peepas MB mtbe
 
05:16:28.850 --> 05:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
other things other than just septic and
 
05:16:31.310 --> 05:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
just addressing the septic is we have
 
05:16:34.010 --> 05:16:34.020 align:start position:0%
very few if any reported cases from
 
05:16:36.590 --> 05:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
drilled artesian wells that have been
 
05:16:38.570 --> 05:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
done within the last 30 years where
 
05:16:41.690 --> 05:16:41.700 align:start position:0%
septics have affected the water quality
 
05:16:43.788 --> 05:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
the potability it's kind of a big deal
 
05:16:46.128 --> 05:16:46.138 align:start position:0%
something in our industry we're quite
 
05:16:49.310 --> 05:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
proud of and this adopting these methods
 
05:16:51.890 --> 05:16:51.900 align:start position:0%
of special construction methods have
 
05:16:53.990 --> 05:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
really helped our to deliver a better
 
05:16:57.530 --> 05:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
product to our customers and we're a lot
 
05:16:59.868 --> 05:16:59.878 align:start position:0%
of the state as you know is not sourced
 
05:17:03.470 --> 05:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
by Public Water Supplies
 
05:17:05.810 --> 05:17:05.820 align:start position:0%
um we don't see any environmental
 
05:17:08.510 --> 05:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
degradation with this bill it also
 
05:17:10.788 --> 05:17:10.798 align:start position:0%
allows us to stay out of the wetlands a
 
05:17:12.470 --> 05:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
lot of times the designers are putting
 
05:17:14.390 --> 05:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
the well literally five feet from the
 
05:17:17.690 --> 05:17:17.700 align:start position:0%
shore on Winnipesaukee or Spofford or
 
05:17:19.310 --> 05:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
anything and you had to drill the well
 
05:17:21.830 --> 05:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
there that was it period you did not
 
05:17:23.930 --> 05:17:23.940 align:start position:0%
we're not given license to go put it
 
05:17:26.628 --> 05:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
wherever you wanted to even with special
 
05:17:29.390 --> 05:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
construction if you did you took it at
 
05:17:31.850 --> 05:17:31.860 align:start position:0%
your own Hazard then you'd have to ask
 
05:17:33.890 --> 05:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
the designer to come back and do what's
 
05:17:36.650 --> 05:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
called an as built and the as belt is
 
05:17:38.628 --> 05:17:38.638 align:start position:0%
kind of like throwing to some people a
 
05:17:40.970 --> 05:17:40.980 align:start position:0%
carte blanche card they could charge you
 
05:17:43.250 --> 05:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
a hundred dollars for that they could
 
05:17:45.050 --> 05:17:45.060 align:start position:0%
charge you a thousand dollars for that
 
05:17:47.390 --> 05:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
that's as built that's outside of what
 
05:17:49.670 --> 05:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
you hired them for initially so this has
 
05:17:51.730 --> 05:17:51.740 align:start position:0%
provided a lot of help to everybody
 
05:17:54.708 --> 05:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
without with we just see it as a
 
05:17:56.930 --> 05:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
win-win-win all the way around
 
05:17:59.330 --> 05:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
and I I did want to again praise the
 
05:17:59.340 --> 05:18:00.530 align:start position:0%
and I I did want to again praise the
Outreach

05:18:00.530 --> 05:18:00.540 align:start position:0%
Outreach
 
05:18:03.530 --> 05:18:03.540 align:start position:0%
um on my on a personal issue I had a
 
05:18:05.690 --> 05:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
septic I had to upgrade my septic at my
 
05:18:09.050 --> 05:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
house and I submitted the plans on a
 
05:18:12.410 --> 05:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
Tuesday afternoon I got my approval on a
 
05:18:13.970 --> 05:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
Wednesday morning
 
05:18:16.368 --> 05:18:16.378 align:start position:0%
unheard of I
 
05:18:18.470 --> 05:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
I just think you know what we've seen
 
05:18:21.110 --> 05:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
with Don Bucher who's hadn't met she
 
05:18:23.270 --> 05:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
came and provided some of the initial
 
05:18:25.430 --> 05:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
Outreach I can't say enough good about
 
05:18:27.288 --> 05:18:27.298 align:start position:0%
how that's been a collaborative effort
 
05:18:29.930 --> 05:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
and our industry is fully supportive as
 
05:18:31.670 --> 05:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
is the legislative New Hampshire water
 
05:18:34.610 --> 05:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
wall board the who oversees the
 
05:18:37.788 --> 05:18:37.798 align:start position:0%
Contracting licensing testing of the
 
05:18:40.610 --> 05:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
contractors in our industry
 
05:18:45.708 --> 05:18:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:47.930 --> 05:18:47.940 align:start position:0%
anyone from Nick have any questions from
 
05:18:50.868 --> 05:18:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:53.410 --> 05:18:53.420 align:start position:0%
representative Darby
 
05:18:56.090 --> 05:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you pay no
 
05:18:58.670 --> 05:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
attention to me I'm only kidding you're
 
05:19:00.288 --> 05:19:00.298 align:start position:0%
you're doing good uh thank you for
 
05:19:02.090 --> 05:19:02.100 align:start position:0%
taking my question I I think I get it
 
05:19:03.708 --> 05:19:03.718 align:start position:0%
but I just want to make sure
 
05:19:05.570 --> 05:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
um so you know you don't you don't want
 
05:19:07.490 --> 05:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
to file this amended plan because that's
 
05:19:08.628 --> 05:19:08.638 align:start position:0%
the red tape
 
05:19:11.868 --> 05:19:11.878 align:start position:0%
but um are you still filing with where
 
05:19:13.190 --> 05:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
the actual Wells going where you're
 
05:19:14.810 --> 05:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
actually Drilling and you know how it's
 
05:19:17.390 --> 05:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
how it's constructed
 
05:19:19.788 --> 05:19:19.798 align:start position:0%
yes it does not relieve the contractor
 
05:19:22.250 --> 05:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
of the filing requirement it actually
 
05:19:24.890 --> 05:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
puts it in one document instead of three
 
05:19:29.390 --> 05:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
and so on a water well report uh you
 
05:19:32.390 --> 05:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
have to file a a report on how the well
 
05:19:34.910 --> 05:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
was drilled how many feet of casing a
 
05:19:36.708 --> 05:19:36.718 align:start position:0%
complete drill log how far it was to
 
05:19:39.050 --> 05:19:39.060 align:start position:0%
bedrock what were the soils that you
 
05:19:39.060 --> 05:19:40.490 align:start position:0%
bedrock what were the soils that you
encountered

05:19:40.490 --> 05:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
encountered
 
05:19:42.890 --> 05:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
Etc and then the casing and the grouting
 
05:19:45.230 --> 05:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
if it was done on these special you know
 
05:19:47.150 --> 05:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
non they call them non-conforming
 
05:19:50.510 --> 05:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
previous you had to have have a form
 
05:19:54.110 --> 05:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
such a non-conforming form filed are
 
05:19:56.990 --> 05:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
filed with the registry deeds and also
 
05:19:59.810 --> 05:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
signed by the customer and essentially
 
05:20:02.390 --> 05:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
said if your well gets can gets polluted
 
05:20:04.490 --> 05:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
by the neighbor's septic system that you
 
05:20:06.288 --> 05:20:06.298 align:start position:0%
can't hold the neighbor or the state
 
05:20:10.190 --> 05:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
liable for it well okay that does that
 
05:20:12.948 --> 05:20:12.958 align:start position:0%
really protect you maybe it does the
 
05:20:14.930 --> 05:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
proper construction methods is a whole
 
05:20:16.850 --> 05:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
lot better than a pile of papers but
 
05:20:19.368 --> 05:20:19.378 align:start position:0%
this puts the document in one location I
 
05:20:21.288 --> 05:20:21.298 align:start position:0%
hope I answered your question
 
05:20:24.470 --> 05:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:27.350 --> 05:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
any more questions from uh from members
 
05:20:29.510 --> 05:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
05:20:31.128 --> 05:20:31.138 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
05:20:33.288 --> 05:20:33.298 align:start position:0%
hi thank you very much for your
 
05:20:35.270 --> 05:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'm certain that the
 
05:20:37.490 --> 05:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
gentleman from Des are happy to have
 
05:20:39.410 --> 05:20:39.420 align:start position:0%
heard your testimony and giving them the
 
05:20:44.030 --> 05:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
accolades that you feel they deserve so
 
05:20:47.570 --> 05:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
you that was being the last
 
05:20:50.448 --> 05:20:50.458 align:start position:0%
pink card
 
05:20:52.850 --> 05:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
and he's going to close the hearing and
 
05:20:58.368 --> 05:20:58.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:02.510 --> 05:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
and the next hearing is
 
05:21:08.090 --> 05:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
there's 488 yeah uh 488 is uh up at 2
 
05:21:08.100 --> 05:21:13.670 align:start position:0%
there's 488 yeah uh 488 is uh up at 2
30.

05:21:13.670 --> 05:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:13.680 --> 05:21:18.948 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:21:18.948 --> 05:21:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:20.810 --> 05:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
did you hear from representative post on
 
05:21:23.628 --> 05:21:23.638 align:start position:0%
this yes yeah are we going to open and
 
05:21:29.770 --> 05:21:29.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:07.208 --> 05:22:07.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:02.230 --> 05:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:04.550 --> 05:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and members of the
 
05:32:04.560 --> 05:32:06.110 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and members of the
committee

05:32:06.110 --> 05:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:32:07.910 --> 05:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
um my name is representative Juliet
 
05:32:11.270 --> 05:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
Harvey bully as you know and I'm uh this
 
05:32:14.090 --> 05:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
is representative Lisa post's Bill and
 
05:32:17.690 --> 05:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
she is unable to to attend today
 
05:32:20.150 --> 05:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just going to very briefly
 
05:32:24.230 --> 05:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
introduce it uh and it is a constituent
 
05:32:24.240 --> 05:32:26.690 align:start position:0%
introduce it uh and it is a constituent
bill

05:32:26.690 --> 05:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:29.030 --> 05:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
the reason for the bill was that a
 
05:32:31.448 --> 05:32:31.458 align:start position:0%
constituent couldn't get um
 
05:32:34.430 --> 05:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
a reservation at a New Hampshire State
 
05:32:34.440 --> 05:32:36.830 align:start position:0%
a reservation at a New Hampshire State
Park

05:32:36.830 --> 05:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:36.840 --> 05:32:37.850 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:32:37.850 --> 05:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:40.788 --> 05:32:40.798 align:start position:0%
and the uh
 
05:32:42.470 --> 05:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
05:32:44.690 --> 05:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
the the idea behind the bill is to allow
 
05:32:46.910 --> 05:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents first come first
 
05:32:50.208 --> 05:32:50.218 align:start position:0%
served over other states but we found
 
05:32:53.090 --> 05:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
out that
 
05:32:55.910 --> 05:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
there's Federal requirements and
 
05:32:57.890 --> 05:32:57.900 align:start position:0%
stipulations that go along with the
 
05:33:00.010 --> 05:33:00.020 align:start position:0%
receiving Federal monies
 
05:33:03.288 --> 05:33:03.298 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire state parks and so
 
05:33:07.190 --> 05:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
they cannot be choosy in that way uh so
 
05:33:11.090 --> 05:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
the sponsor wishes to do uh interim
 
05:33:12.970 --> 05:33:12.980 align:start position:0%
study for the bill
 
05:33:15.708 --> 05:33:15.718 align:start position:0%
is my understanding
 
05:33:18.708 --> 05:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
and they are not interested in pursuing
 
05:33:20.170 --> 05:33:20.180 align:start position:0%
the bill at this time
 
05:33:22.430 --> 05:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:33:25.310 --> 05:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
that's all I have to say about it okay

he'd uh what he would have planned would
 
05:34:07.368 --> 05:34:07.378 align:start position:0%
had planned to say for 10 minutes
 
05:34:11.090 --> 05:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
but for Less now yes it will be less yes
 
05:34:13.610 --> 05:34:13.620 align:start position:0%
Mr Wilson the floor is yours thank you
 
05:34:16.190 --> 05:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman and um good
 
05:34:18.288 --> 05:34:18.298 align:start position:0%
afternoon committee members
 
05:34:21.590 --> 05:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
um uh yeah my apologies for not um
 
05:34:23.990 --> 05:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
having the latest uh up to date of where
 
05:34:26.150 --> 05:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
where this bill stands
 
05:34:29.270 --> 05:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
um so our Our Testimony maybe here a
 
05:34:30.470 --> 05:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
little bit but I'm just going to quickly
 
05:34:33.170 --> 05:34:33.180 align:start position:0%
just summarize and not read everything
 
05:34:35.570 --> 05:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
um in into the record here today but um
 
05:34:37.610 --> 05:34:37.620 align:start position:0%
the department uh appreciates the
 
05:34:39.350 --> 05:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
concern of the bill but we respectfully
 
05:34:41.750 --> 05:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill primarily because it uh
 
05:34:43.550 --> 05:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
would violate
 
05:34:45.350 --> 05:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
um the land and water conservation act
 
05:34:48.530 --> 05:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
which is a federal act uh administered
 
05:34:50.170 --> 05:34:50.180 align:start position:0%
through the National Park Service
 
05:34:52.250 --> 05:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
virtually all of our state park
 
05:34:54.050 --> 05:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
campgrounds have received Federal
 
05:34:57.650 --> 05:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
funding through that program which has a
 
05:34:59.510 --> 05:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
um discrimination Clause
 
05:35:01.368 --> 05:35:01.378 align:start position:0%
um based on um that we cannot
 
05:35:04.010 --> 05:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
discriminate based on residency
 
05:35:07.850 --> 05:35:07.860 align:start position:0%
um primarily for uh the access to there
 
05:35:10.010 --> 05:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
is language within the testimony here
 
05:35:13.788 --> 05:35:13.798 align:start position:0%
that speaks to our our ability to apply
 
05:35:16.250 --> 05:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
um uh separate but measured fee
 
05:35:18.170 --> 05:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
structures for non-residents but in
 
05:35:20.510 --> 05:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
terms of our ability to provide
 
05:35:23.270 --> 05:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
preferential Acts success in this
 
05:35:26.170 --> 05:35:26.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:29.090 --> 05:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
people being able to reserve for a
 
05:35:32.030 --> 05:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
period of time prior to non-residents
 
05:35:35.150 --> 05:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
would be a violation of of of that law
 
05:35:37.490 --> 05:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
and we we have had instances where this
 
05:35:38.930 --> 05:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
has come up in the past primarily with
 
05:35:40.490 --> 05:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
our ski areas a Cannon Mountain and
 
05:35:44.448 --> 05:35:44.458 align:start position:0%
Sunapee where we've looked to be able to
 
05:35:47.830 --> 05:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
issue passes for residents
 
05:35:50.990 --> 05:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
prior to issuing to non-residents and we
 
05:35:52.930 --> 05:35:52.940 align:start position:0%
we have had
 
05:35:54.708 --> 05:35:54.718 align:start position:0%
correspondence from the National Park
 
05:35:57.650 --> 05:35:57.660 align:start position:0%
Service that that that that would not
 
05:35:59.868 --> 05:35:59.878 align:start position:0%
work for us so that is uh the the
 
05:36:02.030 --> 05:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
primary reason uh the secondary reason
 
05:36:03.650 --> 05:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
is more than the mechanics of our
 
05:36:05.930 --> 05:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
reservation system
 
05:36:08.868 --> 05:36:08.878 align:start position:0%
um does not really allow for a system to
 
05:36:10.730 --> 05:36:10.740 align:start position:0%
differentiate between residents or
 
05:36:13.368 --> 05:36:13.378 align:start position:0%
non-residents um over 90 percent of the
 
05:36:15.050 --> 05:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
reservations that are made are done
 
05:36:15.060 --> 05:36:15.970 align:start position:0%
reservations that are made are done
online

05:36:15.970 --> 05:36:15.980 align:start position:0%
online
 
05:36:18.530 --> 05:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
and you can go in and create a profile
 
05:36:21.230 --> 05:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
and put your address as anywhere in the
 
05:36:23.570 --> 05:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
world if you want to and we don't really
 
05:36:25.910 --> 05:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
have uh there is no mechanism within the
 
05:36:28.670 --> 05:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
system to to verify that at the time of
 
05:36:30.830 --> 05:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
reservation the time that that it could
 
05:36:32.930 --> 05:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
be verified would be
 
05:36:35.750 --> 05:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
um at the check-in time that creates
 
05:36:38.930 --> 05:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
additional steps for us to make any
 
05:36:41.208 --> 05:36:41.218 align:start position:0%
changes to that reservation so that
 
05:36:43.250 --> 05:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
would be a very complex Endeavor for us
 
05:36:45.110 --> 05:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
to have to go through
 
05:36:47.330 --> 05:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
um possibly even finding an entirely
 
05:36:50.090 --> 05:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
different vendor to provide our software
 
05:36:52.670 --> 05:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
support for for the reservation system
 
05:36:54.650 --> 05:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
so I think I'll leave it at that thank
 
05:36:57.050 --> 05:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you very much any
 
05:36:58.670 --> 05:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
questions by members of the committee
 
05:37:00.470 --> 05:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
05:37:00.480 --> 05:37:02.990 align:start position:0%
seeing none
uh

05:37:02.990 --> 05:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:37:07.070 --> 05:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:08.150 --> 05:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:37:10.910 --> 05:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
you may what
 
05:37:13.010 --> 05:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
you you realize where this would build
 
05:37:16.128 --> 05:37:16.138 align:start position:0%
this bill is not good we're we're not
 
05:37:17.930 --> 05:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
going to be taking this bill Beyond
 
05:37:23.330 --> 05:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:26.270 --> 05:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh no you can ask him a question you
 
05:37:30.350 --> 05:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
just put this into the uh in uh for your
 
05:37:32.990 --> 05:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
it will be in or studied and that's it
 
05:37:35.510 --> 05:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
so yeah
 
05:37:37.310 --> 05:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
Lisa post
 
05:37:39.190 --> 05:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
didn't know
 
05:37:41.330 --> 05:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
within the bill
 
05:37:44.448 --> 05:37:44.458 align:start position:0%
no at any rate thank you very much and
 
05:37:46.730 --> 05:37:46.740 align:start position:0%
by the way we didn't find out about this
 
05:37:50.090 --> 05:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
uh not being heard of until the quarter
 
05:37:51.288 --> 05:37:51.298 align:start position:0%
of one
 
05:37:51.298 --> 05:37:52.930 align:start position:0%
of one
so

05:37:52.930 --> 05:37:52.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:37:55.250 --> 05:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
