on senate bill
58

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
and a reminder to those at home it's an
 
00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
act relative to the administration of
 
00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 align:start position:0%
occupational regulation by the office
 
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
of professional licensure and
 
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.070 align:start position:0%
of professional licensure and
certification

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that went through the
 
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
senate last term
 
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
and died of the omnibus the main gist of
 
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.509 align:start position:0%
and died of the omnibus the main gist of
this

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
to read that's what we're looking for
 
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
here is it's a
 
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's a standardization of practices
 
00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 align:start position:0%
within no plc
 
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
across the boards that's that's the
 
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
reason why it's so thick because it
 
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.550 align:start position:0%
reason why it's so thick because it
makes

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
makes
 
00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
consistent changes to the to the various
 
00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.910 align:start position:0%
consistent changes to the to the various
boards

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm open to a discussion on this
 
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
anybody has any concerns
 
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
for more objections
 
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
the titles
 
00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
peter i went through the titles here
 
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
just just to highlight the titles when
 
00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
they changed from board to board
 
00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
it took me 20 minutes so you know this
 
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
was this was quite a quite a long read
 
00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
but if
 
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
anybody has any particular points they
 
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
want to make
 
00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
certainly raise their hands and share a
 
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
couple of general questions
 
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
i'm looking on thank you um i'm looking
 
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
on page
 
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
one just one dark width okay and
 
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
um you know the bold phase italic
 
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
thing that changes for instance the
 
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
office may contract for services
 
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
investigators hearing officers leave up
 
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth a little further down
 
00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
around line 19.
 
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
i guess my general question is
 
00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 align:start position:0%
clearly these things were put in because
 
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
these provisions
 
00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 align:start position:0%
weren't the case before they all seemed
 
00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:08.309 align:start position:0%
weren't the case before they all seemed
like

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
rational changes to me can you give me a
 
00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 align:start position:0%
little bit of background
 
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
so i can understand why these things
 
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
already weren't the case
 
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that at one time
 
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
the various boards had
 
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
specific investigators to their boards
 
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
and what has happened of course is that
 
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
it's bloated
 
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
things where now this the way i read
 
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
this it
 
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
gives them the ability to not have to
 
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
have standing investigators
 
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
and they can bring in folks
 
00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
rather than you're talking 15
 
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
53 almost 50 soon to be 54 boards here
 
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.670 align:start position:0%
53 almost 50 soon to be 54 boards here
that's

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's a tremendous amount of people if
 
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
every single board had its own
 
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.350 align:start position:0%
every single board had its own
investigator

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
investigator
 
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
hi representative if i may mr chair
 
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
um having been on this committee for
 
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
many years and
 
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
been concerned
 
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
what happens in oplc the agile car
 
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
also many of these boards were
 
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.629 align:start position:0%
also many of these boards were
originally

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
originally
 
00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 align:start position:0%
autonomous little agencies around
 
00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.430 align:start position:0%
autonomous little agencies around
concord

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
concord
 
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
it was felt that if they were put under
 
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.270 align:start position:0%
it was felt that if they were put under
one

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
main branch that particularly clerical
 
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.270 align:start position:0%
main branch that particularly clerical
work

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
could be shared a lot of them had
 
00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
clerical help that served part-time
 
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
and so it was felt that as an economy
 
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.990 align:start position:0%
and so it was felt that as an economy
measure

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
measure
 
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
they could house them in one place and
 
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
have for example one
 
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
secretary will call that person
 
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
take care of the paperwork for more than
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
one board
 
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
so i hope that helps understanding of
 
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
how oplc came together with all these
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
and mr chairman lindsay courtney the
 
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
executive director
 
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
has joined us in the attendees i i
 
00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
suspect she'd be
 
00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 align:start position:0%

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
courtney
 
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
if you would like to weigh in here on
 
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
senate bill 58
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh good morning mr chair members of the
 
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee thanks for
 
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak and appear
 
00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
before you today lindsey courtney
 
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
executive director
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
office of professional lace insurance
 
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.189 align:start position:0%
office of professional lace insurance
certification

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so this bill is really just a
 
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
cleanup bill from our perspective
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of things um when
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
the office was created
 
00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
first of all i i disagree that there was
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
really there is a consensus about what
 
00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be doing here
 
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
versus versus the boards but um
 
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
but in any event it remains clear that
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
we haven't been able to
 
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
efficiently operate the office by virtue
 
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
of the fact that
 
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
um there remain um conflicting
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
provisions between oplc and the various
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
practice acts
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
so there are a number of things that we
 
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
attempted to clean up
 
00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
i think it was last year in senate bill
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
576 and unfortunately
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
didn't go through because of covid um so
 
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
we essentially split up those two bills
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
this is a policy bill
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
really just designed to clean up and
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
further clarify
 
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
and permit the office to carry out the
 
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
efficient activities that it's required
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
um the first being really establishing a
 
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
retention policy
 
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
the um this is really exactly this is a
 
00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
problem that was really exacerbated by
 
00:07:55.189 --> 00:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
the physical relocation of the office
 
00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:55.990 align:start position:0%
the physical relocation of the office
which

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
um which wasn't done at the request of
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
the office i might
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
i might add it was quite expeditious
 
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.469 align:start position:0%
i might add it was quite expeditious
expedited

00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
expedited
 
00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879 align:start position:0%
um and we had to move in a matter of
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
about 30 to 45 days
 
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
and we essentially have paper everywhere
 
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
and part of the problem is that the
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
board some boards have
 
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
a retention schedules that are approved
 
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
by a secretary of state
 
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
that conflict with each other for the
 
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
same types of records like disciplinary
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
versus licensing and we don't presently
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
have the authority to adopt
 
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
or promulgate a policy across the agency
 
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
um from our perspective a licensing file
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
should be treated the same regardless of
 
00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:35.039 align:start position:0%
what profession it is and the same is
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
true for a
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
disciplinary file so so that was kind of
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
uh the gist of
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
a portion of this bill um are there
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
specific questions or do you want me to
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
just kind of walk
 
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
i mean are there specific questions i
 
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
already testified so i don't want to
 
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
go into great detail um but essentially
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
this is just
 
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
intended to be a cleanup measure and not
 
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
provide substantive
 
00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
changes i think it would be more than
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate to
 
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
if folks have questions for you they're
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
directed at you to certainly do that
 
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
and that's the purpose of the
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so right representative
 
00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:09.110 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so right representative
schmidt

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
schmidt
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh well let me
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
begin by saying that i
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh agree with lindsay that uh this is
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
essentially a cleanup
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh and and trying to pull together uh
 
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
the the uh operations of oplc
 
00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
in a more standardized form uh i think
 
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
one of the aspects is that the
 
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.670 align:start position:0%
one of the aspects is that the
investigative

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
investigative
 
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
capability of the boards uh was
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
it was you know kind of
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
hindered to some degree certainly by the
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
the boards were engaging frequently
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
their own
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
one of their own members uh to do
 
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
investigations well that person
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
might be very expert with regard to the
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
particular professions particularities
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
and peculiarities and so forth but the
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
person might not be
 
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
particularly skilled at investigative uh
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
or potentially prosecutorial aspects so
 
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
having somebody's
 
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
we we've heard from mr porter uh several
 
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.110 align:start position:0%
we we've heard from mr porter uh several
times

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh going into today's meeting uh with
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
regard to his function
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
you can see he's uh you know not only a
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
trained lawyer but also
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
a competent administrator uh so he
 
00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.350 align:start position:0%
a competent administrator uh so he
brings

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
brings
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
that whole aspect in in a way that many
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
of the boards would not have had
 
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
personnel capable of doing that however
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
much they may have understood their own
 
00:10:32.079 --> 00:10:33.190 align:start position:0%
much they may have understood their own
professions

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
professions
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
so the and oplc was intended
 
00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
from the very beginning to be a support
 
00:10:39.279 --> 00:10:39.590 align:start position:0%
from the very beginning to be a support
uh

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
structure uh and standardization and so
 
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
forth everything that lindsay
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
just alluded to is correct so uh i
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
i think that having her give her a
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
bird's-eye view is helpful to people who
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
don't have the background that some of
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
us who've been on the committee for a
 
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
long time
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
uh bring to the table so i'm happy to
 
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
have her talk but
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
if if anybody has specific questions
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
let's have adam
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair good
 
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
morning lindsay
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
um miss courtney sorry um
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
i'm curious if i assume you have spoken
 
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.910 align:start position:0%
i'm curious if i assume you have spoken
with

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
a member of the various boards
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
particularly with
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
reference to retention of records and
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
areas of expertise for the various
 
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.829 align:start position:0%
areas of expertise for the various
professions

00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
professions
 
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
if there could perhaps be different
 
00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:47.590 align:start position:0%
if there could perhaps be different
needs

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
for length of retention depending on the
 
00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:51.670 align:start position:0%
for length of retention depending on the
board

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
and how much consideration was given to
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
those aspects
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
yeah i thank you representative um i
 
00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:01.519 align:start position:0%
don't have an opinion on what the
 
00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:02.389 align:start position:0%
don't have an opinion on what the
retention

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
retention
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
schedule should look like based on the
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
file type
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
um i think it's important from an
 
00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
efficiency standpoint that we have one
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
or two different types of retention
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
schedules versus what we have now which
 
00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:14.710 align:start position:0%
schedules versus what we have now which
is

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
basically 54. um and we just can't
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
administratively support that
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
um i have spoken to a number of the
 
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
boards and the boards are are not
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
you know opposed to having a one
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
retention schedule
 
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
um i think they feel the same pain that
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
we have although they're not living in
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
you know they're not in the office so
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
they're not you know covered with files
 
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
um the boards do want to be
 
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
part of the process in terms of
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
determining what's appropriate and i
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely support that i'm not sure
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
that the subject matter really should
 
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.350 align:start position:0%
that the subject matter really should
dictate

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
dictate
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
what uh you know in terms of there
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
should be board specific retention
 
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.710 align:start position:0%
should be board specific retention
schedules

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
schedules
 
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
you know licensing file is a licensing
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
file um regardless of what profession
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
um you are are a member of
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
um a physician licensing file will
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
certainly carry
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
different information versus like a
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
cosmetology licensing file but when we
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
think about the purpose of a board which
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
is to protect the public
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
you know that that whole purpose has to
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
weigh into the factors
 
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
in consideration if how long do we keep
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
this file um
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
and i don't really think that that's uh
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
suggestive or
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
i don't think that the subject matter of
 
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
the profession really should dictate
 
00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.470 align:start position:0%
the profession really should dictate
that

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
um i think we can easily come up with
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
some sort of agreement where a licensing
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
file is kept for
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
a certain period of time a disciplinary
 
00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:35.839 align:start position:0%
file is kept for a certain period of
 
00:13:35.839 --> 00:13:36.550 align:start position:0%
file is kept for a certain period of
time

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
um maybe an inspection file is kept for
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
a certain period of time
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
um regardless of the profession but
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
obviously i welcome the board's thoughts
 
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
um certainly as as we move forward
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
thank you and do you have a plan to um
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know meet with the various board
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
members to
 
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
hash this out with them yeah
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's quite um it's quite difficult i
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
think pursuing change in the office um
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
to some extent because
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
the boards don't always meet regularly
 
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
and essentially you have to go to 54
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
different board meetings and caucus
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
a number of board members we rely a lot
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
on our board administrators but also
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
most recently starting in april 1 we've
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
um we've been providing legal support at
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
every meeting for the entirety of the
 
00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.590 align:start position:0%
every meeting for the entirety of the
meeting

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
um i have been communicating with all
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
board members on a quarterly basis via
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
letter because i want everybody to
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
receive the same amount of information
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
the same type of information at the same
 
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.910 align:start position:0%
the same type of information at the same
time

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
um so i think our thought is we might
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
utilize the survey tool
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
to be perfectly honest um that might be
 
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
the fastest way of getting uh
 
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
feedback um we do have tools in-house
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
such as surveymonkey
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
uh to get that feedback from the boards
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
um because otherwise i think it's going
 
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
to take us forever to
 
00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
move the ball forward you know even an
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
inch and we certainly need
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
um we need to we need to do a lot more
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
in a short period of time in terms of
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
establishing efficiencies
 
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
thank you i i definitely would encourage
 
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.030 align:start position:0%
thank you i i definitely would encourage
uh

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
doing a poll such as that um i'm i'm
 
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:10.790 align:start position:0%
doing a poll such as that um i'm i'm
sure

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
aware that depending on the profession
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
there may be needs other than than what
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
you're looking at
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
if if one profession has a licensing
 
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
period of two years for their license
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
as opposed to those that have one year
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
obviously that would kind of require a
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
different retention period
 
00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
if you're retaining them for seven years
 
00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:36.790 align:start position:0%
if you're retaining them for seven years
for

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
a one year profession that's seven
 
00:15:40.079 --> 00:15:40.949 align:start position:0%
a one year profession that's seven
rounds

00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
rounds
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
but if it's a two-year profession that's
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
only three so
 
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
just just wanted to bear in mind that
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
that could be a need
 
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
and it should be explored so thank you
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
oh you're welcome and on that point
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
representative i would just note
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
we um from my perspective we need to
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
retain the licensure file for the
 
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
entirety that somebody is licensed
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
and then the question is really how long
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
after the person is no longer licensed
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
do you retain the files so um
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
i think that would be something that the
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
boards would need to consider
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
some have um you know seven years after
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
a person is deceased i mean that's a
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
very long time
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
um but then others are you know 10 years
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
after they are no longer licensed so
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
that's really what we're looking at
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
for those that that are not overly
 
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
familiar oplc
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
is really in its infancy as a as an
 
00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:36.870 align:start position:0%
is really in its infancy as a as an
organization

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
so you know some of these boards are
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
still going through a little bit of a
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
growing pain
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
if you will because they they did
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
operate autonomously for
 
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
for a very long time
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
know as as we all try to find
 
00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
ways in state government to not only
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
make things more efficient but more cost
 
00:16:57.839 --> 00:16:58.790 align:start position:0%
make things more efficient but more cost
effective

00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
effective
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
you know i i can understand how they're
 
00:17:01.839 --> 00:17:02.389 align:start position:0%
you know i i can understand how they're
still

00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
you know some of these boards are still
 
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079 align:start position:0%
holding on a little bit to
 
00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
the ways of the past and you know that's
 
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
certainly a struggle that
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
you you obviously do on a daily basis
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
here so
 
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
you know the basically you know the
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
first two pages of the bill
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
kind of give the broad you know the
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
broad spectrum and authority that
 
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
that the office needs to have
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
here um and then the rest of this bill
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
it just really kind of does the minutia
 
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.070 align:start position:0%
it just really kind of does the minutia
of

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
hitting each individual board and
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
you know what what is either repealed or
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
brought in to
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
streamline this and i'm you know i've
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
certainly not received any specific
 
00:17:43.679 --> 00:17:45.350 align:start position:0%
certainly not received any specific
objections

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
objections
 
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
from specific boards at least
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
at least to me as the chair of the
 
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and i would imagine that
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
you know their standard procedure at
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
this point would be to bring them
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
through you
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
so you know if you have any that you're
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
that you're dealing with that you need
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
to bring forward violence do so but
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
um the other thing i want to touch on
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
before i go to representative schmidt
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
is there was some discussion in the in
 
00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
the general hearing
 
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
when it came to the premium compensation
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
of the boards and i
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
just want to i highlighted this and i
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
just want to point out that you know on
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
page two
 
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
line six where section three is the rate
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
of predictive compensation for all
 
00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:23.750 align:start position:0%
of predictive compensation for all
boards

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
basically will be will be set by oplc
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
um which which makes sense to me what
 
00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
that doesn't say
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
is that it's all going to be the same
 
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
and i would presume that you still are
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
going to retain
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
discretion as to what the per diem
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
compensation is
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
for specific boards based on and i hate
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
to use the word value of time
 
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
but certain professions do inherently
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
greater value of time so i would presume
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
you're still operating that way that
 
00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:55.039 align:start position:0%
you're gonna the premiums will be looked
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
at individually
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely so right now um
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
i think you're totally correct uh
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
representative in that um the per diem
 
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
rates shouldn't be
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
the same um what we'd like to do is make
 
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
sure that every board member is
 
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
receiving a per diem
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
not all boards receive a per diem the
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
majority of technical boards don't
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
receive anything at all
 
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
um and so we want to make um give give
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
all board members a per diem
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
and then obviously look at the amount of
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
time that's where that's required in
 
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
order to be a board member
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we're currently
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
doing in the office is a reassessment of
 
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
our staff
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
um to representative um schuett's point
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
a lot of our
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
staff have historically been part-time
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
which has been a barrier to achieving
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
efficiencies so
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
um you probably noted in the budget that
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
we requested a reduction of our
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
part-time staff and
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
an increase in our full-time staff but
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
what we're doing right now with the
 
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
division of personnel is
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
essentially doing a reassessment of our
 
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
staff and the first step of is really
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
classifying the boards
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
based on um basically the amount of time
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
that's involved in both administering
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
the boards and being a board member
 
00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:01.830 align:start position:0%
the boards and being a board member
using

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
using
 
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
you know quantifiable metrics so i
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
imagine that we'll use some sort of tool
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
to propose different structures for per
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
diems um
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
and then obviously seek the board's
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
input as previously discussed through
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
through surveys and whatnot what we want
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
to avoid
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
is unclear expectations
 
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
and in in make sure that we have
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
sufficient amount of appropriations but
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
also make clear
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
as to um when a board member is entitled
 
00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:29.909 align:start position:0%
as to um when a board member is entitled
to

00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
per dam and when when they may not be so
 
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
also too just a reminder
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
the the compensation for the board
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
members comes out of the fees and it's
 
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:37.750 align:start position:0%
members comes out of the fees and it's
not

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
is not coming from taxpayer money
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
correct yes correct correct
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um thank you mr
 
00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.270 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um thank you mr
chairman

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
so i might turn my camera back on um
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
one of the issues we've already spoken
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
about a little bit this morning is the
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
retention of records
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh and i think while it's uh
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
nice to be able to go back 10 or 15
 
00:21:01.679 --> 00:21:02.390 align:start position:0%
nice to be able to go back 10 or 15
years

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
with regard to somebody who may have
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
been a member of a particular profession
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
a licensed
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
member one of the the
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
problems in doing so is if you have
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
paper records which is of course
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
what everybody had for a long long time
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
at some point you
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
i will start to literally kind of
 
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.230 align:start position:0%
i will start to literally kind of
suffocate

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
suffocate
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
in the the sheer quantity of
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh of paperwork that you have in boxes
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
or stacked here and there and everywhere
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
can you speak to that
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
a little bit more specifically uh miss
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
courtney uh
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
because i i think that's something that
 
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
the new members may not
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
quite recognize that uh that you are in
 
00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919 align:start position:0%
smaller quarters than you were uh like
 
00:21:45.919 --> 00:21:46.390 align:start position:0%
smaller quarters than you were uh like
uh

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
i was very familiar with the offices
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
over at philbrook
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh that you had previously and i believe
 
00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.430 align:start position:0%
uh that you had previously and i believe
you've

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
you've
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
you've been reduced to what uh maybe
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
a third or fourth quarter quarter of the
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
uh the space you had before which was
 
00:22:01.039 --> 00:22:01.990 align:start position:0%
uh the space you had before which was
not

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
it's not like you were work working
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
inside the
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
los angeles coliseum uh but you had a
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
lot more space before and
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
the retention of records is uh is a real
 
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.510 align:start position:0%
the retention of records is uh is a real
problem

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're uh having to deal
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
with a lot less space
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yes we have
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
reduced our space by about six thousand
 
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
square feet which is about a third of
 
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
what we had previously out of philbrook
 
00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.110 align:start position:0%
what we had previously out of philbrook
um

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
has become a significant concern for the
 
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.549 align:start position:0%
has become a significant concern for the
office

00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
we have begun a push um to move every
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
all licensing online
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
and all renewals are now online
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
thankfully um
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
and so the idea is that if we can at
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
least stop
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
the flow of paper we can deal with what
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
we have which is a significant amount of
 
00:22:45.919 --> 00:22:46.789 align:start position:0%
we have which is a significant amount of
paper

00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
paper
 
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
um all um initial licensing should be
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
online by
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
august of 2022 so that's a goal that we
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
have and
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
it looks we're moving in that direction
 
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
pretty nicely
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
we have started a scanning project where
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
we've been working with
 
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
the bureau of graphic services to scan
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
in all of our
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
old documentation and what we're dealing
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
with now is how do we manage that we
 
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:09.830 align:start position:0%
with now is how do we manage that we
don't

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
yet have a document management system um
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
that interfaces with our licensing
 
00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:15.029 align:start position:0%
that interfaces with our licensing
portal

00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
portal
 
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
and so that's something that we're going
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
to be looking to hopefully acquire
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
after we obtain a budget um
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
but to your point yes we're retaining
 
00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:24.870 align:start position:0%
but to your point yes we're retaining
records

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
essentially indefinitely and when we
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
moved from philbrook
 
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
um we had to clean out that storage shed
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
that was in the back and
 
00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:32.799 align:start position:0%
we have records dating back to you know
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
the 30s the 20s
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's really um problematic in
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
terms of just
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
managing paper um and being able to
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
retrieve information
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
um right just getting at this stuff
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh becomes a real problem when you've
 
00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
got stuff that's literally
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
buried at the bottom of a pile yeah it's
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
kind of like
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
trying to remove the bottom figure on a
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
totem pole
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
yes it reminded me of cleaning out my
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
you know grandparents house
 
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not gonna lie speaking as somebody
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
was as
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
probably as old as your grandparents uh
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
i i know that uh that phenomenon very
 
00:24:09.919 --> 00:24:10.630 align:start position:0%
i i know that uh that phenomenon very
well

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
um but one one thing that should be
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
referenced in our discussions this
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
morning is the fact that
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh that that some of the records uh
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
especially the board of psychology
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
records uh where confidentiality
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
is is key um and having records
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
uh that could fall into the wrong hands
 
00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
um is is a real issue when you're
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
mental health aspects where uh the the
 
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
client's privacy
 
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh is essential um many of the records
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with in other professions
 
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
are but
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
completely different nature uh and so
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
disposing of them
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh the physical records anyway once they
 
00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.830 align:start position:0%
uh the physical records anyway once they
are

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps you know as you say scanned
 
00:24:57.279 --> 00:24:57.909 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps you know as you say scanned
in

00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh it's a different matter entirely so
 
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
yes i wouldn't advocate for retaining
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
paper records forever but
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh you must have sought some state-owned
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
storage space that where you can you
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
know move the older files
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
scoring yeah we do have some storage
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
um space off-site through the department
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
of admin services
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
um state space space is at a premium um
 
00:25:27.679 --> 00:25:27.990 align:start position:0%
um state space space is at a premium um
right

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
now it's hard to come by i believe we
 
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
have records in the walker building
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
we also have a lot of
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
not records but equipment uh furniture
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
that are is
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
presently being stored on a truck that
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
we're renting um
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
until we can figure out how to um
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
basically uh dispose of that that
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
equipment um so we do um and we have
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
looked into
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
securing a storage space and independent
 
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
storage space
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not um financially a
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
burden um
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
but it's more of a burden to actually
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
physically maintain all the files in an
 
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate format so that they're
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
easily accessible
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you so fantastic so that you know
 
00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:10.630 align:start position:0%
thank you so fantastic so that you know
that

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
that pretty much covers the the opening
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
general part of this
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
like i said the rest of this bill is all
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
just individual
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh changes to the boards to get them in
 
00:26:20.159 --> 00:26:21.669 align:start position:0%
uh changes to the boards to get them in
line

00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
and like i said i i don't i haven't seen
 
00:26:25.039 --> 00:26:25.510 align:start position:0%
and like i said i i don't i haven't seen
any

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
objections but i'll i'll let
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
representative goalie pipe up here
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
and see what he has to say
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i noticed there's
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
repeals in this bill
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
and i mean that that concerns me when
 
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
you go down line by line looking at
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
some of the things that are being
 
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
repealed i think we need to take a
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
closer look
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
and make sure that really need to be
 
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.029 align:start position:0%
and make sure that really need to be
repealed

00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
we're not hearing from the boards on
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
them which concerns me
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
um and i'll start just from the first
 
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
section of repeals i look at
 
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
in the page bottom of page five
 
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if miss courtney could
 
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
help me out here
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
um we're repealing uh under the
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
um alcohol and other drug use
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
professionals hearings
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
section uh repealing uh section relative
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
the rules for the conduct of hearings
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
and relative to retaining experts in
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
investigations or hearings
 
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
amended the bill that dealt with
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
hearings recently and we
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
we're pretty specific in that the boards
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
will retain the right
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
to the hearings and ask for an
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
investigator if necessary
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
um so i want to know how repealing these
 
00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i just want to
 
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
look at that so
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
as a as a just an overall matter um
 
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
this bill was part of a larger bill that
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
i tried to basically cut in half and it
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
was written
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
it was drafted when the investigations
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
bill was essentially one that would
 
00:28:07.919 --> 00:28:08.389 align:start position:0%
bill was essentially one that would
create

00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
create
 
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
one um investigations set of rules
 
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
um and really the gist of that is
 
00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919 align:start position:0%
because it's very difficult to operate
 
00:28:15.919 --> 00:28:16.310 align:start position:0%
because it's very difficult to operate
under

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
54 or 55 different sets of rules
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
specific to latex let me take a look at
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
that i can tell you why we're repealing
 
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh mileage is because we'd like to put
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
that in rule
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
not all boards have uh entitlement to
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
mileage and some boards only have
 
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
entitlement mileage so we think that's
 
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:32.389 align:start position:0%
entitlement mileage so we think that's
better

00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
placed in rules so that it can cover all
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
boards and when you need to change
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
something you're just changing it once
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
instead of 54 different times
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
um regarding uh line 37 relative to
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
retaining experts for investigations or
 
00:28:44.559 --> 00:28:45.510 align:start position:0%
retaining experts for investigations or
hearings

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
it's our um understanding of working
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
with doj is that the boards no longer
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
have the authority to retain to enter
 
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
into contracts that the contracting is
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
done through the office of professional
 
00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
lace intern certification
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
so certainly they can still retain
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
experts but it has to be through the
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
office so they're not actually
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
going out and making payments they no
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
longer have their budgets
 
00:29:06.559 --> 00:29:11.430 align:start position:0%
longer have their budgets
um

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
specific to number nine um roman numeral
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
nine let me just take a look at that
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
because that could be an area
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
miss courtney if you have it please give
 
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
us the line number and page number
 
00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
and roman numeral
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
9 procedures for the conduct of hearings
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
consistent with the requirements of due
 
00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.269 align:start position:0%
consistent with the requirements of due
process

00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so this was drafted when we were
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
hopefully planning to obtain legislation
 
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
that would permit us to
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
to just have one set of hearings rules
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
for all boards
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
um certainly if you want to strike that
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
out in light of their
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
recent statutory amendments that would
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
make sense to me um but that was
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
the that was the basis for for those
 
00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.269 align:start position:0%
the that was the basis for for those
changes

00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
so that this doesn't affect what we're
 
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
doing in the other
 
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that's going
 
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
forward i don't think it affects it no
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
i i mean but this repeal would certainly
 
00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.269 align:start position:0%
i i mean but this repeal would certainly
remove

00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
remove
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
at least from the alcohol and drug
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
statute practice act
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
the ability for the board to promulgate
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
rules regarding hearings
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
the understanding was in the previous
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that the boards
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
could do the hearings and ask for an
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
investigator if necessary
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
taking out this making rules for
 
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.310 align:start position:0%
taking out this making rules for
hearings

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
eliminates that from them correct and we
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
didn't want to do that is that correct
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
yeah that's correct so in light of the
 
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
stack in light of the amendment that the
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
that the committee um approved you know
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
you may want to change that so that
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
we're not repealing um
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
page 5 line 36 um
 
00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:05.919 align:start position:0%
i mean again our perspective is that
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's incredibly difficult to have
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
so many sets of rules that are
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
procedural in nature
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
and that's really the gist of hearings
 
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
rules is
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
the rules are centered on when you file
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
a motion when you file a pleading how
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
long you have to respond
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
they're not substantive in nature and so
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
from our perspective there really is no
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
reason why you need to have 56 different
 
00:31:28.149 --> 00:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
sets of rules but
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
um but certainly to to in line with um
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
the committee's recommendations
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
regarding that amendment you may want to
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
eliminate that repeal thank you mr
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
chairman could you make note that we may
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
i did like that like and you know on top
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
of that miss courtney so
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
if that's the case under the alcohol
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
and other drug professionals do we find
 
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
this exact repeal
 
00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
anywhere else i mean you know what i
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
mean because we're looking at
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
one group actually you know the second
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
the second group in here
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
is does this occur does this occur in
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
other parts
 
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
um most likely um i see it in
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
317a which is cosmetology on page 11.
 
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
um i see it on
 
00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:23.519 align:start position:0%
page 11 line 36 regarding 326h i think
 
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
it's dietitians
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
so i mean what i could do uh
 
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
representative is i could go through and
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
propose an amendment that would
 
00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.070 align:start position:0%
propose an amendment that would
eliminate

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
eliminate
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
um the repeals regarding hearings
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
if that would if that would be helpful
 
00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
to you sure that
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
because we're looking we're gonna need
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
someone to do a deep dive here into
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
where that's located in
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
in all the various sports because
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
because again if we're if we're
 
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
establishing this to streamline and be
 
00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.590 align:start position:0%
establishing this to streamline and be
consistent

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
then any amendment brought forward would
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
have to be streamlined and consistent
 
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair if i may
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
suggest i'm i'm thinking in terms of
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
engaging investigators and i'm wondering
 
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.710 align:start position:0%
engaging investigators and i'm wondering
if

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:18.559 align:start position:0%
back on page one if the
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
line that says the office may contract
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
for the services of
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
hearing officers legal counsel and
 
00:33:25.679 --> 00:33:26.870 align:start position:0%
hearing officers legal counsel and
experts

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
experts
 
00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
as necessary if we inserted before the
 
00:33:29.919 --> 00:33:30.950 align:start position:0%
as necessary if we inserted before the
words

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
words
 
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
as necessary perhaps in consultation
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
with the appropriate board
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
would that be acceptable
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
ms courtney i assume that you would be
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
anyway but i think uh perhaps
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
members of our committee might be more
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that wording included
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
yeah i would have no problem with that
 
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
you just make a note
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative you said various boards
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
maybe appropriately in consul
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
in consultation with the appropriate
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
board in other words if they're engaging
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
an investigator
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
for cosmetology
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
applicants they would consult with that
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
board obviously to
 
00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
to be sure that the investigator that
 
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
they are considering
 
00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
is something that that board is kind of
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
miss courtney in your experience and i
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
know you've been with those plc
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
for a brief time here would
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
would the request for an investigation
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
typically come from
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
a board or would it come from the oplc
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
office itself
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's something that we're still trying
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
to work through um historically the
 
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
boards have
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
basically started investigations i can
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
from my perspective i have concerns with
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
that idea because
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
um and i've shared this and we've talked
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
about it openly with the boards and
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
legal counsel
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
because one of the issues that we're
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
running into is is um
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
whether or not there are perceived
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
violations of due process but or actual
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
violations of due process
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
when boards are intimately involved in
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
the actual investigative process it's
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
very hard for them
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
to to at least remain um or create the
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
perception that they are a neutral body
 
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
that is also the adjudicating body
 
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:38.079 align:start position:0%
so when you think of boards the boards
 
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
are the judge so should the board also
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
be the police officer and the prosecutor
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
no but that's essentially the the
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
statutory um
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
authority and the framework that's been
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
created for them
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
and so what we've tried to do um working
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
with collaborative
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with the boards is try
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
to like silo that process
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
either to have a board member who's kind
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
of like reviewing complaints and making
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
recommendations and or assisting with
 
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
the rois
 
00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
and just bringing the reports of
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
investigation to the board for decision
 
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:08.950 align:start position:0%
investigation to the board for decision
making

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
making
 
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
but there are a lot a number of boards
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
that still insist on being intimately
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
involved with the investigations process
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
i can understand that that you're in the
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
you're in the old line of
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
you know who's guarding the guards here
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
great it becomes it becomes
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
circular in a way right i definitely see
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
your point with that
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
on the other hand some profession so
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
detailed that
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
only someone who has done that work
 
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
may know the ins and outs of of
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
certainly agree representative which is
 
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
why i think we need it we have
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
um we're trying to set up a framework
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
where we pair experts we retain them as
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
necessary or we request board members to
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
utilize their expertise
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
while at the same time preserving on the
 
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
neutrality of the
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
the board that's actually going to be
 
00:37:06.839 --> 00:37:10.230 align:start position:0%
the board that's actually going to be
voting

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh so uh
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
as some of us will recall that's one of
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
the problems that we've had with
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh the um with
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
the uh oversight of
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
of daycare centers uh that
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
some of the licensees have brought up
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
real problems with the idea that that
 
00:37:33.839 --> 00:37:34.310 align:start position:0%
real problems with the idea that that
the

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
agency is a judge jury and executioner
 
00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
uh and so uh
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
that is as representative was just
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
pointing out
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
it's difficult when you have something
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
that's very detailed
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
that only professionals would easily
 
00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.470 align:start position:0%
that only professionals would easily
understand

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
and have any background in uh by the
 
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
same token
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
the judge jury and executioner thing
 
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:00.079 align:start position:0%
just lends itself to
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
uh to potential abuses
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
and authoritarianism on the part of some
 
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.069 align:start position:0%
and authoritarianism on the part of some
practitioners

00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
of uh some uh oversight
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
agencies but maybe
 
00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
not having that particular issue in
 
00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.510 align:start position:0%
not having that particular issue in
statute

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
in this bill at this time until
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
until the oplc has worked out
 
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
some kind of a balancing act where you
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
have neither the in neither of the
 
00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.270 align:start position:0%
have neither the in neither of the
extremes

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
extremes
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh included i i think that's something
 
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
i think that's where we're headed and
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
not trying to put that in statute at
 
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
this point
 
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
where we haven't quite worked out how
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schmidt
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative allegro yeah i
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
agree with that and uh i actually would
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
even expand upon it i think it's a
 
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
critical issue because not only
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
can a board be or any agent be a judge
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
during an executioner but
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
they set the rules to the plaintiffs to
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
the investigator
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
and then they're the judge jury and
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
executioner as well
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
and also too as we saw last term
 
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
there was there was a significant amount
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
of concern brought forward in the world
 
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:20.310 align:start position:0%
of concern brought forward in the world
of

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
that that i don't think is
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
super unique to that one particular
 
00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:30.310 align:start position:0%
super unique to that one particular
group

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
so so i i do agree that having having
 
00:39:36.069 --> 00:39:36.079 align:start position:0%
that a bit of separation there
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
for the sake of due process really does
 
00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:39.349 align:start position:0%
for the sake of due process really does
matter

00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
matter
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
and also too you know we're talking
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
about investigations of
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
when you get to the point of bringing in
 
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
investigators we've had a substantial
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
violation here a substantial problem and
 
00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.310 align:start position:0%
violation here a substantial problem and
that

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
should should be if it you know for the
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
point of investigators
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
should be obvious to someone that is
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
more than just a technical expert
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
if you know if you're looking at an
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
egregious act
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
that a board would would say we need to
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
take action and investigate this
 
00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
you should be able to convince me of
 
00:40:08.839 --> 00:40:12.630 align:start position:0%
you should be able to convince me of
that

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
a subject matter expert this isn't a
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
matter of you know did i use a 90 degree
 
00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.190 align:start position:0%
matter of you know did i use a 90 degree
elbow

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
elbow
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
elbow and a plumbing fitting instead of
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
a 45 you know we wouldn't
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't elevate that to that sort
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
of level so
 
00:40:26.309 --> 00:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
these are these are acts that that
 
00:40:26.319 --> 00:40:27.589 align:start position:0%
these are these are acts that that
should

00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
when when brought forward should make
 
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
sense to to lay people to a point
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
well that's what that's that's why
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
having mr porter as part of the process
 
00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
where he has experience in
 
00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.470 align:start position:0%
where he has experience in
investigations

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
and administration from that end of
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
things because there is going to be some
 
00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.069 align:start position:0%
things because there is going to be some
uniformity

00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
uniformity
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
in in investigations above and beyond
 
00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:49.670 align:start position:0%
in in investigations above and beyond
that

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
the highly technical things that you
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
might have in some professions
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
so it's a it's a balancing act and it's
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
very difficult
 
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm suggesting and i think
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
we're heading in the direction of
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
of excluding that from this bill so that
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
jumping off the diving board before
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
we're sure whether there's any water in
 
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
the pool
 
00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:11.750 align:start position:0%
the pool
representative

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that there was uh
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
in senate bill
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
133 section 7 was the
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
authority of the office of professional
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification for
 
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
administration of rulemaking and
 
00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement of investigations hearings
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
and appeals
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee did a thorough vetting
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
of that bill and working with
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
tom broderick miss courtney and
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
amended the bill and came back with a
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
final pro
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
product that i think we were happy with
 
00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:49.510 align:start position:0%
product that i think we were happy with
so

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
um as we continue to talk about
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
investigations hearings and appeals that
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
was already part of
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh senate bill 133 yeah and i think that
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's certainly your justification for
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
for removing that part out of this bill
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
we don't want to if that's already been
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
worked out we don't want to
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
cause certainly don't want to cause
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
confusion in the statute
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
correct so so no i i have no
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
i certainly have no issue with that i
 
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
again if it's been addressed in another
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
bill there's
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
there's no point in doing it here so
 
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
but i think you know i think we've
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
covered certainly covered that aspect of
 
00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.550 align:start position:0%
covered certainly covered that aspect of
it

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
do you either right
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
just confirming just confirming
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
representative goldie's remarks
 
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh i'm i'm recalling that specific
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
aspect so that is something that we were
 
00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.270 align:start position:0%
aspect so that is something that we were
happy

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
happy
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
with the uh this solution we'd worked
 
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.309 align:start position:0%
with the uh this solution we'd worked
out

00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
is uh mr broderick on this call
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
i don't see him no he's not he's not on
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
he's on another
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
um we're trying to provide legal support
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
to all the boards right now and uh
 
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
i know spread a little bit activating a
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
little bit i just got off a lancer here
 
00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.470 align:start position:0%
little bit i just got off a lancer here
so

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm just uh mindful of what
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
representative gold
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
just said i would hope that you and he
 
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:14.790 align:start position:0%
just said i would hope that you and he
would

00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:18.079 align:start position:0%
take a a good look at uh this bill
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
to see if there are conflicts such as
 
00:43:21.119 --> 00:43:21.829 align:start position:0%
to see if there are conflicts such as
that

00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
that we can wipe from this bill so that
 
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
we're only concentrating on
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
one yeah absolutely that's what we'll do
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
we'll go through the bill and we'll make
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
sure it's consistent with the amendment
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
that was put forth by
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh the committee regarding 133 right
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
i do um if if we could get some clarity
 
00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:40.630 align:start position:0%
i do um if if we could get some clarity
on

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
um on page one line seven the office may
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
contract for the services of
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
investigators hearing officers legal
 
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
counsel and experts as necessary i
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
assume that
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
we still want to keep that in but just
 
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
make that modification
 
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
um to be in consultation with the boards
 
00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.630 align:start position:0%
um to be in consultation with the boards
yes

00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
um i also have as we go down looking at
 
00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.349 align:start position:0%
um i also have as we go down looking at
the

00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
things that are being repealed a few
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
questions on some of these issues as we
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
go further down the bill if i may ask
 
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
some questions on those later on
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
on page eight line
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
eight um under allied health
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
relative to rule making by the allied
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
health board of directors
 
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
um why are they not i'm not sure what
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
they what's going on there and why
 
00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
that's being repealed
 
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
why why are they no longer allowed to
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you i we're not removing all
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
rule making capabilities
 
00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:54.170 align:start position:0%
let me just cross-reference it um
 
00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:58.309 align:start position:0%
let me just cross-reference it um
[Music]

00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
it would just be rules regarding fees
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
um rules regarding um
 
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
hold on the design and content of
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
application forms
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
um i think we subsequently make clear
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
that the boards retain the
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
authority over eligibility requirements
 
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
procedures forms and fees for temporary
 
00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.750 align:start position:0%
procedures forms and fees for temporary
licensure

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
and procedures for receipt of misconduct
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
complaints so this would be one of those
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
that as we go through
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
we would probably um modify
 
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
to not repeal 328 f13 roman numeral two
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
regarding the
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
receipt of misconduct of complaints so
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
start with
 
00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
three to five instead of two to five yes
 
00:45:46.319 --> 00:45:49.670 align:start position:0%
three to five instead of two to five yes
exactly

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh if i may mr chair i think um
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
ms courtney had said that she's going to
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
go through and
 
00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
and re-examine all of the repeals
 
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh with reference to those specific
 
00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:04.710 align:start position:0%
uh with reference to those specific
areas

00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
and i it's appearing that we're going to
 
00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.069 align:start position:0%
and i it's appearing that we're going to
need

00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:08.079 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
another meeting bill to deal with those
 
00:46:11.839 --> 00:46:12.230 align:start position:0%
another meeting bill to deal with those
to

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
be able to put forward a cohesive
 
00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.670 align:start position:0%
be able to put forward a cohesive
amendment

00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
right and and not having tom uh
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
broderick involved in this process today
 
00:46:23.119 --> 00:46:23.750 align:start position:0%
broderick involved in this process today
is

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh i understand he can't be in two
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
places at one time
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
but since he is uh certainly the uh
 
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
the mechanic if you will that is uh
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
doing the work on this
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh it's imperative to have his
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
involvement in it
 
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
so i agree that we're gonna probably
 
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
need a second session
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely tom um we can get time
 
00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
involved absolutely i was the one who
 
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
drafted this bill and i drafted it
 
00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
133 so i've drafted them all pretty much
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
so so i've
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
been um more than happy to also
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
participate but we can certainly get
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
tom's involvement as well
 
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
well i i i it's good that in in a sense
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
that you've been involved in the
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
drafting it means you do understand
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh what's what's been done by the same
 
00:47:08.069 --> 00:47:08.079 align:start position:0%
token as executive director
 
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh your time is precious with regard to
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
being the director and not not a
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
mechanic as well
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative so we we are
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
going to have to be mindful of some
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
deadlines here
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
with this because we we have we are
 
00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.870 align:start position:0%
with this because we we have we are
approaching

00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
approaching
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
this month while we're thinking about
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
this maybe i can
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
mention just one other aspect which
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
hasn't been discussed this morning
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh back in the early days of uh of
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcguire's time in the
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
in the house and on this committee
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
uh there were a lot of repeals that were
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
in one of the bills
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh and it was pointed out by some of the
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
agencies that
 
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
uh that that some of the requirements
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
that were being repealed or some of the
 
00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.309 align:start position:0%
that were being repealed or some of the
statutes

00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
that were being repealed were the
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
underpinning for
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh some of the structures that uh that
 
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
had been created
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
and by repealing them you were kind of
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
tearing the basement out of the building
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh and uh so those repeals were
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
were withdrawn because they would have
 
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
erect the uh
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
the uh the legitimacy and the structure
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
of the of the agency so that probably is
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
not the case here too much but
 
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh we need to be mindful of that as well
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
as you have invoked the name of our
 
00:48:29.599 --> 00:48:30.230 align:start position:0%
as you have invoked the name of our
chair

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire if she
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
to uh chair i'm glad to hear that you're
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
looking at this
 
00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
in such detail and coordinating it with
 
00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:53.670 align:start position:0%
in such detail and coordinating it with
133

00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
133
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
i'd also like to remind you to take a
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
look at the amendment
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
that courtney presented
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
and the deadline for this bill is
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
27 yes the 27th
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
so that that's that's the deadline to
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
we have a finished amendment yes yes so
 
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's going to be necessary
 
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i agree
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
so our major concern is is basically
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
fitting another subcommittee in uh to
 
00:49:52.079 --> 00:49:53.589 align:start position:0%
fitting another subcommittee in uh to
accommodate

00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
accommodate
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
staff that needs to facilitate
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
a remote meetings such as this
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
what i schedule next week
 
00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
tuesday and thursday and the following
 
00:50:07.119 --> 00:50:09.109 align:start position:0%
tuesday and thursday and the following
tuesday

00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
tuesday
 
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
you can i believe that there are plenty
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
of openings that week
 
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
week of the eighth of monday would be
 
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
the 17th
 
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
so you can say it's convenient for the
 
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.870 align:start position:0%
so you can say it's convenient for the
subcommittee

00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
okay yeah i'm showing we're already
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
we're already booked for the 18th
 
00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
um we have a
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh an executive session that pays for as
 
00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:51.990 align:start position:0%
uh an executive session that pays for as
many

00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
you know start at two o'clock or
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
something and uh
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
i'll have another uh final exact session
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
or you can you can get another day
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
there's no it doesn't seem there's much
 
00:51:08.309 --> 00:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
competition for licenses
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
okay you're gonna remind that this is
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee so you only need a
 
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
24-hour notice
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
yeah right right you can go
 
00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
you can go for a monday mondays are
 
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
it would be good just to to avoid the
 
00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
24-hour notice if at all possible
 
00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
if you can get it in the calendar it's
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
definitely a preferred
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
way to go yeah we would pam at the
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
earliest we
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
would this would be the week of the 16th
 
00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:39.270 align:start position:0%
would this would be the week of the 16th
so

00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
okay great mr chair um representative
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
mcguire's audio was breaking
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
to me did i understand her to say that
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
she had
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
forwarded an amendment on this bill to
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
the committee members
 
00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:58.950 --> 00:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
and we have that um is was there a
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
numbered amendment
 
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
or what date should we look for that on
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
i found an amendment from senator carson
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
um 1153
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
s it to senate bill 58 is that the one
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
you're referring to representative
 
00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:14.069 align:start position:0%
you're referring to representative
mcguire

00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
mcguire
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
no although that one needs to be
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
considered as well
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
this one i sent it to
 
00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh i received it from this courtney
 
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
as a she wanted to
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
put it into one tree but i thought it
 
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
was more
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
christmas applicable to senate bill 58
 
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
so i sent it
 
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
out to the committee for that i will
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh step away when i finish talking to
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
you also find it
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
and send it to you thank you
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
it was to eliminate the requirements
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
that board
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
members physically sign a license
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's a nuisance and i can't see
 
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
i think i do recall seeing that
 
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.510 align:start position:0%
i think i do recall seeing that
amendment

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
i remember seeing it i i'm not finding
 
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:50.800 align:start position:0%

something about signing but
 
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%

hmm

00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
now as far as as far as the removing of
 
00:54:58.710 --> 00:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
the physical physical signature part of
 
00:54:58.720 --> 00:54:59.510 align:start position:0%
the physical physical signature part of
this

00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
it is it is in fact 2021
 
00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
and the ability to to handle things
 
00:55:06.559 --> 00:55:07.910 align:start position:0%
and the ability to to handle things
digitally

00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
digitally
 
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
certainly exists and you know that's
 
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
with this this outdated requirement
 
00:55:18.319 --> 00:55:18.789 align:start position:0%
with this this outdated requirement
really

00:55:18.789 --> 00:55:18.799 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
time times are such that you know all
 
00:55:26.549 --> 00:55:26.559 align:start position:0%
you're really doing with these
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
signatures is just
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
just affirming the things are in fact
 
00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:31.270 align:start position:0%
just affirming the things are in fact
valid

00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
valid
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
and that honestly the oplc would be
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
doing that anyway if things were called
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
into question
 
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.839 --> 00:55:56.330 align:start position:0%
 
difficult

00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:56.340 --> 00:56:00.829 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:00.839 --> 00:56:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:12.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
do you see one representative fire for
 
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
senate bill 133
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
that was that was just kind of a
 
00:56:36.069 --> 00:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
statement as to
 
00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:38.559 align:start position:0%
as to one of the one of the emails that
 
00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:41.250 align:start position:0%
we did receive
 
00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:42.390 align:start position:0%
we did receive
[Music]

00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
so you have the two amendments one
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
official from senator carson and one
 
00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.549 align:start position:0%
official from senator carson and one
unofficial

00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:48.559 align:start position:0%
unofficial
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
i just i just resent it to be committed
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:19.109 --> 00:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
so it should be out there for anybody
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
who's looking
 
00:57:38.829 --> 00:57:38.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
oh i i didn't get that i didn't get an
 
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
email from the carol little
 
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
um yeah but we have a physical it looks
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
oh i don't know that's odd that i didn't
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
get it
 
00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
should be on that list
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm not on that i'm not on that
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
all right well we can uh if uh
 
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
and representative schmidt have have
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
that we can
 
00:58:41.349 --> 00:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
we can certainly take up senator
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
i apologize mr chair someone was at my
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
door were they delivering an amendment
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
to you
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
so wonderfully the amendment
 
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
says okay so to insert section one of
 
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at 310 2a which i
 
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.190 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at 310 2a which i
believe

00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:59:30.789 --> 00:59:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:30.799 --> 00:59:40.690 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:59:40.690 --> 00:59:40.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:42.710 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
okay so what has changed in this
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
amendment is
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
the bottom part of the italicized where
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
it says
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
rules for pharmacists and pharmacy
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
technicians licensed by the pharmacy
 
01:00:06.079 --> 01:00:06.789 align:start position:0%
technicians licensed by the pharmacy
board

01:00:06.789 --> 01:00:06.799 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
shall include requirements for training
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
and experience regarding pharmacy laws
 
01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:26.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:26.839 --> 01:00:28.069 align:start position:0%
 
pharmacy

01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
pharmacy
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
and it's extraordinarily specific
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately senator carson's not here
 
01:00:41.829 --> 01:00:41.839 align:start position:0%
with us to give us context miss courtney
 
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
are you
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
do you understand the context of this
 
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
yes okay help us out here thank you mr
 
01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:49.190 align:start position:0%
yes okay help us out here thank you mr
chair

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
so um this came about essentially at the
 
01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
request of representative merchant
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
who had expressed concerns regarding the
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
original bill as drafted that was
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
presented in the senate
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
the concern um was basically um
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
that we have three investigators here
 
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
who are employed by oplc who assist the
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
board of pharmacy
 
01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
in a number of states i've moved in the
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
direction of utilizing non-pharmacists
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
or non-pharmacy technicians to conduct
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
inspections for pharmacy
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
which um both the pharmacy board myself
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
and representative merchant agree is not
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
conducive to protecting public safety um
 
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative merchant and the board
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to make clear
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
that and you know in the event i leave
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
and somebody else isn't
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
responsible for hiring that the statute
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
mandated that
 
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
um that the inspectors uh for pharmacy
 
01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
actually have the requisite experience
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
in pharmacy um
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
as opposed to um law enforcement
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
officers as other states have used
 
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
okay i can understand that but what then
 
01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
why why would this be put into the
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
general part of this and not
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
under the statute where under
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
one of you know this would be page 26
 
01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:04.069 align:start position:0%
one of you know this would be page 26
under

01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
pharmacy board so
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
um i apologize because i don't have the
 
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
actual amendment in front of me
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
um the one that i'm looking at says
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
amend section 104 of the bill by
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
replacing page 25 lines 30 through 34
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
with the following
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
pharmacy board inspection shall be
 
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
provided by pharmacists or pharmacy
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
technicians licensed by the new
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire board of pharmacy who have
 
01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
training and experience regarding
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
privacy statutes and rules
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a different that's the
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
second half of this amendment
 
01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:33.039 align:start position:0%
okay but what what i read was the first
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
half of this amendment
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
that is inserting this into rather than
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
inserting it into the pharmacy board
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
part of it it inserts it into
 
01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:46.839 align:start position:0%
basically under administration of the
 
01:02:46.839 --> 01:02:48.789 align:start position:0%
basically under administration of the
office

01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
yeah i think the only reason
 
01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
justification i can offer
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
is that there's a there's a general
 
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:56.710 align:start position:0%
is that there's a there's a general
disconnect

01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
disconnect
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
the staff are employed by the office i
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
think that that's still
 
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
something that um boards have a concern
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
with that they don't have direct reports
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
they don't have direct staff
 
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
and this has come up in the context of
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
pharmacy because
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
technically the pharmacists who are
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
conducting inspections don't work for
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy board
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
and they can be conducting inspections
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
and do conduct inspections um
 
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
in other professions um like veterinary
 
01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:23.510 align:start position:0%
in other professions um like veterinary
medicine

01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
and whatnot so by virtue of that because
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
they're actually staff
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
and not specific to pharmacy i think it
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
could go in the general administration
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
um just to make it super clear that
 
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
these types of staff
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
should have this requisite information
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
um training education experience
 
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
we could certainly limit it to 318 9a
 
01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
regarding inspectional services
 
01:03:49.109 --> 01:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
um but i can envision a scenario where
 
01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:51.039 align:start position:0%
we're using a pharmacist staff member to
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
do something that's not
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know not specific to to 318.
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
i mean you have to live with this so
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's why i'm asking
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and honestly this was just a
 
01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.029 align:start position:0%
yeah and honestly this was just a
compromise

01:04:03.029 --> 01:04:03.039 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
i mean we didn't draft it with this
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
language because we didn't think it was
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
necessary because
 
01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
because i i completely agree that and
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
by virtue of the supplemental job
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
descriptions we're not allowed to hire
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
or anybody that doesn't have the
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
requisite experience
 
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
but this is essentially a compromise
 
01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:22.470 align:start position:0%
but this is essentially a compromise
because

01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know just to make sure that the
 
01:04:25.589 --> 01:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
pharmacy board was comfortable with this
 
01:04:25.599 --> 01:04:26.069 align:start position:0%
pharmacy board was comfortable with this
language

01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
so if this is what they were comfortable
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
with and i'm happy to
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
i think it's i think it's fine i don't
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
think it's necessary but i think it's
 
01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:35.109 align:start position:0%
think it's necessary but i think it's
fine

01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
fine
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
can i just interject um and just so you
 
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:38.230 align:start position:0%
can i just interject um and just so you
know

01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
miss courtney i just emailed you the
 
01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.750 align:start position:0%
miss courtney i just emailed you the
amendment

01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
so so you can see it
 
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
in real life and i i'm listening to the
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
discussion but looking at the
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
amendment that the sentence added to the
 
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
first section on line
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
seven through nine of the amendment and
 
01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
it doesn't refer to inspections it just
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
refers to
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
technicians that are licensed
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
so it seems kind of disconnected from
 
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
the second one
 
01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
yeah i agree it should probably be
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
changed to reflect that it's
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
um staff who conduct
 
01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
inspections yeah i think that would
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
would would help everybody yeah this is
 
01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
right as i've read this that's why
 
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
that's why i asked if it was appropriate
 
01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
to be in this section because it's
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
yeah it seems it doesn't seem like it
 
01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
has anything to do with
 
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
inspections it talks about pharmacy tax
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah i can certainly make that um
 
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
propose change and get that back to the
 
01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:43.430 align:start position:0%
propose change and get that back to the
committee

01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
so look looking at the bottom half
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
and i'll the amendment i'll give you a
 
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
chance to bring that up
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
this this does refer to section 104
 
01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.630 align:start position:0%
this this does refer to section 104
which

01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
in fact in the bill is relative to
 
01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
pharmacy boards
 
01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:07.589 align:start position:0%
pharmacy boards
so

01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
again that's this is also adding a
 
01:06:10.559 --> 01:06:11.190 align:start position:0%
again that's this is also adding a
sentence

01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
at the bottom that's the change the
 
01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
upper the first part of italicized is
 
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
already there
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
so this the addition here is
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
similar to above where it is the last
 
01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:23.670 align:start position:0%
similar to above where it is the last
sentence

01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
pharmacy board inspections shall be
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
provided by pharmacists or pharmacy
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
technicians licensed by the new
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire pharmacy board
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
okay so is this not is this just not
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
repeating oh are we looking at
 
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
redundancy here
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
so it sounds to me like the first part
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
of this doesn't need to exist
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
i would agree with that i mean
 
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
because in essence if you're if you're
 
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
changing the first section of this
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
to what we just talked about you're just
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
just creating language that it
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
started at the bottom yeah
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
i i i agree um i don't think it needs to
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
be there
 
01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
so we can we can just do away with the
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
top half of this yeah
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:12.839 --> 01:07:15.349 align:start position:0%
 
sense

01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions on the
 
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
okay fantastic so moving on now to the
 
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
now this is that what ms smarling just
 
01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
resent to us
 
01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
also oplc amendment
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
um mike representative mcguire if you're
 
01:07:59.670 --> 01:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
if you're still there this this says
 
01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:01.839 align:start position:0%
amendment to senate bill 133
 
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
so i is it fair to presume that this is
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm seeing also and that
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
that was my concern that
 
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
um we're into issues that are
 
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
contained in 133 also and i think we
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
need to be careful
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
that we're not we we've overlapped
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
well exactly and that and representative
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
goalie's already brought that up that
 
01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:37.590 align:start position:0%
goalie's already brought that up that
we're

01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
you know where we can't we can't bring
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
two bills forward
 
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
that in essence are covering the same
 
01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
area right yeah it's gonna become
 
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
problematic so
 
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
so i guess once we get representative
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
mcguire back we can find out if this is
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
because that's what i mean it literally
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
says amendment to senate bill 133 on it
 
01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.189 align:start position:0%
says amendment to senate bill 133 on it
right

01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i thought she had said that it was
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
drafted as an amendment to senate bill
 
01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
133 but she felt it was more
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate to senate bill 58
 
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
but i could certainly be wrong
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
so just so that while we're waiting on
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
that looking through this
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
um the first page is signed and dated by
 
01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
the chairperson we have
 
01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
signed by members signed by members side
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
by members this is
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
this is uh hand sealed signed by members
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
okay so what this is what this is doing
 
01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
i mean since we have the time and
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether it's 58 or 133
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
we're all gonna be
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
we're all gonna be looking at it anyway
 
01:09:42.189 --> 01:09:42.199 align:start position:0%
this seems to be
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
consistently across the board removing
 
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
the requirement of physical
 
01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
being struck out that's that's
 
01:09:59.350 --> 01:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
i agree mr chair if i can point out uh
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire lives fairly
 
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
close to me
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
it is extremely windy here i
 
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
assume it is where she is although so
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
she may be having electrical issues
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
yeah clear clearly she was having
 
01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
internet issues when she
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
she addressed us earlier but i mean this
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just following this email chain from
 
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
that representative mcguire sent out
 
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
attached to this email
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
um and i don't know if miss courtney
 
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
wants to
 
01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
talk to us about this this originally
 
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
came from her to represent mcguire
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
and then was forwarded to p.m and you it
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
wondering if it was jermaine to 58
 
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
versus 133
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if we want to hear from
 
01:11:05.189 --> 01:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
either pm or miss courtney on them who
 
01:11:05.199 --> 01:11:06.310 align:start position:0%
either pm or miss courtney on them who
are

01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
attachment happy to speak to it um this
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
is an issue that has come up
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
um recently
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
um by virtue of the fact that um
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh you know we've we're trying to move
 
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
to an electronic platform
 
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
and um it's very difficult for us to
 
01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.149 align:start position:0%
and um it's very difficult for us to
physically

01:11:30.149 --> 01:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
physically
 
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
keep capturing board members electronic
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
signatures i'm not even sure if that's
 
01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:34.630 align:start position:0%
signatures i'm not even sure if that's
appropriate

01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
or consistent with the statutory
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
requirements that exist as you see in
 
01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
front of you
 
01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
so i had reached out to representative
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
mcguire regarding this amendment
 
01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
this is completely certificates i
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
believe are separate from what's in 133
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
and 58
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
um so i have reached out regarding 133
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
from my perspective i think it could go
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
in 58 i think it can go in 133
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
um but um it's a slowly it's a slowly
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
separate issue regarding certificates
 
01:12:00.719 --> 01:12:03.110 align:start position:0%
separate issue regarding certificates
only

01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes i guess my
 
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
question would be either to you or to pm
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
is this considered
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
germaine to this bill or non-germain
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
yeah i think you know what my sense of
 
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
it was since
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
58 is relative to the administration of
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
the oplc
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
and this is clearly to me it's an
 
01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.510 align:start position:0%
and this is clearly to me it's an
administrative

01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
feature that it it is germane i mean i
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not the
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
the you know the only one who can
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
weigh in on germaness but from my sense
 
01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:40.470 align:start position:0%
weigh in on germaness but from my sense
it

01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
it fit in with with 58. okay thank you
 
01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
that may be why representative mcguire
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
stated what she did in reference to this
 
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
being more appropriate to 58
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
because because this this clearly is
 
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
just an administrative
 
01:12:59.430 --> 01:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
change but that's you know that's all
 
01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:00.630 align:start position:0%
change but that's you know that's all
this

01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's just striking out the the
 
01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
requirement for and again too you know
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about streamlining and
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
consistency here
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
if we're going to go to electronic
 
01:13:08.239 --> 01:13:10.149 align:start position:0%
if we're going to go to electronic
records

01:13:10.149 --> 01:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
records
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
we need to go to electronic signatures i
 
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
mean i know
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
it would seem weird to me that we would
 
01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
maintain databases of electronic records
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
and then have to have a random piece of
 
01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:24.640 align:start position:0%
that doesn't that doesn't seem to jive
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to i very much agree
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
mr chair one more question to miss
 
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
courtney if i may absolutely
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh in the email the initial email to
 
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
that went out
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
with this amendment uh you mentioned
 
01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
senate bill 13
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
that this language was part of and
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
didn't move forward could you give us a
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
little more insight as to what
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
that was yeah 13 um it's a senate bill
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
that um pertains primarily only
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
to fee so to be honest with you i'm not
 
01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
sure why when i was drafting this
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
i included in 13 um when i went back and
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
i'm like oh
 
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
probably shouldn't have done that um 13
 
01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:10.790 align:start position:0%
probably shouldn't have done that um 13
basically

01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
um was the person at 576 that removed
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
the provisions from the practice acts
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
that granted the boards the authority to
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
promulgate fees
 
01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
and or created statutory fees because if
 
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
you recall 310a
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
theoretically grants to the office the
 
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
ability to promulgate fees
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
but uh the boards have retained that
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
authority in their practice act so
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
that's that cleanup portion
 
01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
and it went to uh senate ways and means
 
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
just kind of hung out there i i don't
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
know if they're going to try to tack it
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
on to hp2 if they're just going to
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know lay it on the table i don't
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
know what they're going to do with that
 
01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
so all right thank you
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
if i'm hearing you correctly the this
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
amendment here that removes the
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
electronic signature part was sent to
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
ways it means
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
yeah because it was it was tied up
 
01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.070 align:start position:0%
yeah because it was it was tied up
within

01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
within
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
the fee bill i i don't know why i
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
drafted it mr chair that
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
in that way um i have to say it was very
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
difficult i think to split the bill
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
um and so it was just a drafters error
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
um it was tied up in a fees bill so
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
okay i wasn't aware that the fee
 
01:15:22.229 --> 01:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
structure of oplc
 
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
would never go to ways and means
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
that just in specular to me since edna
 
01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:28.550 align:start position:0%
that just in specular to me since edna
has

01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of completely dealing
 
01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
with overdancing
 
01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:40.640 align:start position:0%
um mr chair um
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
if if we are going to incorporate
 
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
this draft amendment into senate bill 58
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
um i think rather than
 
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
i haven't gone through to see if
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
all the language for well i'll just pick
 
01:15:59.040 --> 01:15:59.510 align:start position:0%
all the language for well i'll just pick
one

01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
um well the one that i'm looking at uh
 
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
section 329 colon 14.
 
01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
action on license applications
 
01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
two of the draft amendment
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
rather than incorporate all of this
 
01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
language to just
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
show that we're striking that one line
 
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
if we could incorporate these pieces
 
01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
under those headings and just show the
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
line that's being deleted
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
i think that would simplify things and
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
one thing that i would point out
 
01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
in this specific section uh this is
 
01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
probably for miss
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
courtney especially um
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:58.470 --> 01:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
stating that the license the
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
the way it's lined out it doesn't make
 
01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
sense in that specific sentence
 
01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
i think it needs to say stating this
 
01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:07.669 align:start position:0%
i think it needs to say stating this
grammatical

01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
grammatical
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
radical problem yeah i think it says
 
01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:10.709 align:start position:0%
radical problem yeah i think it says
like

01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
this shall state that the licensee is
 
01:17:13.679 --> 01:17:15.830 align:start position:0%
this shall state that the licensee is
authorized

01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay it's it's a little bit funky the
 
01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
way um
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
yeah the ing was struck out but
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
it's a little hard to read but um i
 
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
think it works
 
01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
okay yeah your strikeout kind of at
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
least in my copy kind of
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
found its way over to the e so
 
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm just saying if if all of the
 
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
i mean the huge paragraphs are included
 
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
here to show the lines struck out
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
to show the context but if we don't have
 
01:17:50.550 --> 01:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
that entire paragraph in this
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
bill i'm just saying perhaps we don't
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
need to
 
01:17:57.189 --> 01:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
incorporate all these paragraphs because
 
01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
that's going to make this bill even
 
01:17:58.719 --> 01:17:59.910 align:start position:0%
that's going to make this bill even
larger

01:17:59.910 --> 01:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
larger
 
01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i think ols would just do the
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
paragraphs they would just break out
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
i think i think um miss courtney you
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
know just
 
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to give you the full context yeah
 
01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:10.070 align:start position:0%
wanted to give you the full context yeah
yeah

01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
most of this is just the paragraph with
 
01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
the exception of maybe
 
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
the second to last one and the one that
 
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.990 align:start position:0%
the second to last one and the one that
represented

01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
represented
 
01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
i haven't found all of them yet so some
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
of them it is
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
and we would need the paragraph right
 
01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:28.229 align:start position:0%
and we would need the paragraph right
yeah

01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
yeah for example on unlike the first one
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
328 f i think if it just included
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh roman numeral four and then obviously
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
if you're striking a b would just be
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
renumbered to become
 
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
yeah as long as the ls is happy with
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
that yeah i think that's all that would
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
01:18:59.110 --> 01:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
put forward as as the amendment to this
 
01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:00.630 align:start position:0%
put forward as as the amendment to this
bill

01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
i think like i said i'm still looking
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
through trying to find all the sections
 
01:19:08.709 --> 01:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
i would imagine too with the on the on
 
01:19:08.719 --> 01:19:09.830 align:start position:0%
i would imagine too with the on the on
the

01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
third page section the 151 part where
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
where part three is struck out that
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
four would become three yeah
 
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
that one that would also i mean there
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
there is there is pieces of statue where
 
01:19:27.990 --> 01:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
where there are roman numeral lines and
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
they just say repealed on them
 
01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
i mean that does exist so right that's
 
01:19:32.719 --> 01:19:33.030 align:start position:0%
i mean that does exist so right that's
what

01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
i'm saying i don't know that we need to
 
01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
have all this other
 
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
language the rest of it just seemed the
 
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
rest of it all just seems to be parts of
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
sentences so
 
01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
yeah those are in those two particular
 
01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:45.669 align:start position:0%
yeah those are in those two particular
locations

01:19:45.669 --> 01:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
locations
 
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that's fine you know
 
01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
but i don't i is there any is there any
 
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
other is any objections to
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here with this it seems
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
pretty straight forward to me
 
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know again we're the focus of of
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
oh no we're we're doing a lot of good
 
01:20:18.149 --> 01:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
stuff here
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
so beyond that another suggestion i
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
would have
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
i have gone through the bill previously
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
and noticed in several places
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
um and i've i don't know that i've
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
got all of them but um
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to find some of my little
 
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
quick notes
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:57.070 align:start position:0%
for example page 10
 
01:20:57.070 --> 01:20:58.830 align:start position:0%
for example page 10
[Music]

01:20:58.830 --> 01:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:01.430 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
down under repeals chiropractic
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
um number four 40 uh line 21
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
um i'm sorry wrong line lines
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
a true record of all their official acts
 
01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
shall be made and preserved
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
and it did say by the board's executive
 
01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:29.910 align:start position:0%
and it did say by the board's executive
director

01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
director
 
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
and that's chained to office of
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
professional licensure
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth that exists in dozens
 
01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
of locations throughout the stock right
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
exactly that's my point and i'm just
 
01:21:42.719 --> 01:21:45.030 align:start position:0%
exactly that's my point and i'm just
saying

01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
retention policy established by the
 
01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:48.470 align:start position:0%
retention policy established by the
office

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if we should include
 
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
that language that we discussed
 
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
in the very first page about
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
in consultation with the appropriate
 
01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:01.189 align:start position:0%
in consultation with the appropriate
board

01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
the only problem is that at this point
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
what happens if you have three boards
 
01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
that don't like it
 
01:22:11.669 --> 01:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
or three boards that want to retain this
 
01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
or not well my point is that some boards
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
may feel the need to retain things
 
01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:23.189 align:start position:0%
may feel the need to retain things
longer

01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
longer
 
01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
miss courtney did say that there could
 
01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
be possibly two or three
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
different retention periods agreed to
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
and i would hope that in her
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
polling of the boards that she would be
 
01:22:38.070 --> 01:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
align those accordingly so that you
 
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:42.639 align:start position:0%
would end up with only
 
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
possibly two or three different
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
retention periods
 
01:22:49.110 --> 01:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
so that i just bring it up because like
 
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
i said i did go through the bill before
 
01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
we started
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
a few days ago actually and and loaded a
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
few of those places
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
in this case in order for that to work
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
that would the oplc
 
01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
would have to would have to do this
 
01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:07.590 align:start position:0%
would have to would have to do this
statutorily

01:23:07.590 --> 01:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
statutorily
 
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
i don't think that we need to handcuff
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
that i think that miss courtney's office
 
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
should shouldn't be just handling that
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
through through the authority we give
 
01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:17.510 align:start position:0%
through through the authority we give
them

01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
all right i just like i said i just put
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
that forward because the thought had
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
occurred to me when i was
 
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
originally going through the bill
 
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
is there any other parts of senate bill
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
58 that are
 
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
in need of discussion beyond the
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
marching orders we've given to miss
 
01:23:41.679 --> 01:23:42.709 align:start position:0%

amendments

01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
we have no attendees with hands up and
 
01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:57.830 align:start position:0%

01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
rest of us so if that's the case then
 
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:02.960 align:start position:0%

03:02:11.110 --> 03:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
making a handful of our leadership
 
03:02:13.590 --> 03:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
senior leadership positions that aren't
 
03:02:16.309 --> 03:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
unclassified unclassified and then
 
03:02:16.319 --> 03:02:17.349 align:start position:0%
unclassified unclassified and then
standardizing

03:02:17.349 --> 03:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
standardizing
 
03:02:20.469 --> 03:02:20.479 align:start position:0%
how they're treated based on uh uh who
 
03:02:21.670 --> 03:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
they are and
 
03:02:23.510 --> 03:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
the directors and above have a term
 
03:02:24.710 --> 03:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
governing council
 
03:02:27.190 --> 03:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
sure director levels that so i think
 
03:02:29.590 --> 03:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
it's fairly straightforward
 
03:02:30.790 --> 03:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
and that's the amendment that you
 
03:02:34.870 --> 03:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:36.389 --> 03:02:36.399 align:start position:0%
yeah representative licorich has a
 
03:02:38.389 --> 03:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
question hi uh thank you
 
03:02:41.349 --> 03:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
for uh for a layman would you just give
 
03:02:41.359 --> 03:02:41.750 align:start position:0%
for uh for a layman would you just give
a

03:02:41.750 --> 03:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:02:44.550 --> 03:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know two maybe three sentences
 
03:02:45.110 --> 03:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
just to
 
03:02:48.790 --> 03:02:48.800 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
03:02:51.670 --> 03:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
lay out for me why the changes are and
 
03:02:52.389 --> 03:02:52.399 align:start position:0%
what are the
 
03:02:56.830 --> 03:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
key advantages just simple terms sure
 
03:03:00.230 --> 03:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
um so in the state system most employees
 
03:03:01.590 --> 03:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
are classified
 
03:03:03.590 --> 03:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
this is this is the executive branch the
 
03:03:05.110 --> 03:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
legislative branch has its own pace
 
03:03:06.309 --> 03:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
schedules and the
 
03:03:08.070 --> 03:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
judicial branch does its own thing too
 
03:03:09.910 --> 03:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
but in the executive branch
 
03:03:12.630 --> 03:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
the lion's share of employees are our um
 
03:03:12.640 --> 03:03:13.030 align:start position:0%
the lion's share of employees are our um
un

03:03:13.030 --> 03:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
un
 
03:03:15.429 --> 03:03:15.439 align:start position:0%
are classified employees dated dating to
 
03:03:17.510 --> 03:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
the implementation of the merit system
 
03:03:18.950 --> 03:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
in 1940
 
03:03:20.790 --> 03:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
um based on social security act
 
03:03:22.469 --> 03:03:22.479 align:start position:0%
amendments um
 
03:03:24.230 --> 03:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
what it what it means functionally is
 
03:03:26.950 --> 03:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
that they are all hourly employees
 
03:03:30.389 --> 03:03:30.399 align:start position:0%
who are placed into uh one of 35 levels
 
03:03:31.510 --> 03:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
on a grid
 
03:03:33.510 --> 03:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
a grid that has nine steps but has 35
 
03:03:35.349 --> 03:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
labor grades the positions are evaluated
 
03:03:36.790 --> 03:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
and placed on that
 
03:03:38.830 --> 03:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
over the history of the state senior
 
03:03:38.840 --> 03:03:40.790 align:start position:0%
over the history of the state senior
positions

03:03:40.790 --> 03:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
positions
 
03:03:44.070 --> 03:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
are called um officers
 
03:03:46.469 --> 03:03:46.479 align:start position:0%
of the state um and at the time as the
 
03:03:49.110 --> 03:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
treasurer and the comptroller and the
 
03:03:51.510 --> 03:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
the major department heads and it became
 
03:03:54.150 --> 03:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
a slightly broader group over time
 
03:03:56.630 --> 03:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
are are salaried employees in an
 
03:03:58.070 --> 03:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
unclassified grid
 
03:04:00.550 --> 03:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
it's also a grid where most employees
 
03:04:01.269 --> 03:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
are on
 
03:04:03.670 --> 03:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
a labor grade they're lettered instead
 
03:04:04.389 --> 03:04:04.399 align:start position:0%
of numbered
 
03:04:09.349 --> 03:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
a a is the is the lowest and um
 
03:04:11.429 --> 03:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
i believe that the governor and the
 
03:04:12.630 --> 03:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner of health and human
 
03:04:14.309 --> 03:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
services are both mm
 
03:04:16.790 --> 03:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
which is the um there are higher grades
 
03:04:18.550 --> 03:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
but there's almost nobody at them
 
03:04:20.710 --> 03:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
except i think the medical examiner um
 
03:04:22.630 --> 03:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
so but people are placed on that grid
 
03:04:25.269 --> 03:04:25.279 align:start position:0%
commissioners across the the state are
 
03:04:26.630 --> 03:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
all on that level assistant
 
03:04:29.030 --> 03:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
commissioners and deputy commissioners
 
03:04:31.670 --> 03:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
um and most directors many directors
 
03:04:32.469 --> 03:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
state it's
 
03:04:34.710 --> 03:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
sort of hit and miss in our department
 
03:04:37.590 --> 03:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
some directors are some directors aren't
 
03:04:40.469 --> 03:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
classified or unclassified think of
 
03:04:42.870 --> 03:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
classified as hourly
 
03:04:46.150 --> 03:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
unclassified as salaried those are the
 
03:04:48.830 --> 03:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
major distinctions between the two
 
03:04:51.750 --> 03:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
um many of our senior leadership
 
03:04:51.760 --> 03:04:52.469 align:start position:0%
um many of our senior leadership
positions

03:04:52.469 --> 03:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
positions
 
03:04:54.389 --> 03:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
are but not all of them are the
 
03:04:56.230 --> 03:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
advantage is to
 
03:04:59.750 --> 03:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
make a consistent group from our
 
03:05:01.750 --> 03:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
from our department standpoint so every
 
03:05:03.349 --> 03:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
director is not
 
03:05:05.910 --> 03:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
almost every director we have some
 
03:05:07.269 --> 03:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
deputy directors who are
 
03:05:09.349 --> 03:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
some deputy directors who aren't this
 
03:05:10.790 --> 03:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
will be all
 
03:05:12.710 --> 03:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
deputy directors and then a handful of
 
03:05:14.309 --> 03:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
similar positions
 
03:05:16.870 --> 03:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of the level of responsibility
 
03:05:18.309 --> 03:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
that they have
 
03:05:20.630 --> 03:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
such that they are senior management the
 
03:05:22.150 --> 03:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
additional ones are we have a position
 
03:05:24.630 --> 03:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
called senior operational analyst
 
03:05:27.910 --> 03:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
um that position is unclassified but we
 
03:05:29.750 --> 03:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
would make clear that it would be like
 
03:05:29.760 --> 03:05:30.469 align:start position:0%
would make clear that it would be like
all

03:05:30.469 --> 03:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:05:32.710 --> 03:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
other classified below division which is
 
03:05:34.309 --> 03:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
that they serve
 
03:05:35.990 --> 03:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
um pleasure of the commissioner as
 
03:05:38.389 --> 03:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
opposed to for a term which means
 
03:05:40.150 --> 03:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
not so much that it doesn't mean so much
 
03:05:42.230 --> 03:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
that that they're that you know they
 
03:05:44.710 --> 03:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
they live and die on my whim it means
 
03:05:46.150 --> 03:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:05:47.910 --> 03:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
they don't have a term that ends where
 
03:05:49.349 --> 03:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
their job ends
 
03:05:51.030 --> 03:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
and they must be reappointed they just
 
03:05:52.710 --> 03:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
they just have a job
 
03:05:54.630 --> 03:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
um it would also be true of the internal
 
03:05:56.150 --> 03:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
auditor a position that's currently
 
03:05:56.160 --> 03:05:57.110 align:start position:0%
auditor a position that's currently
vacant

03:05:57.110 --> 03:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
vacant
 
03:06:00.870 --> 03:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
um the plant and properties
 
03:06:03.990 --> 03:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
um superintendents or bureau chiefs
 
03:06:06.230 --> 03:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
the people who are responsible for
 
03:06:07.670 --> 03:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
positions that at one time were the
 
03:06:09.750 --> 03:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent of building and grounds
 
03:06:12.870 --> 03:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
um back in the day um those three major
 
03:06:13.990 --> 03:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
positions these are all
 
03:06:16.630 --> 03:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
positions that are at the very highest
 
03:06:18.469 --> 03:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
levels of the
 
03:06:20.710 --> 03:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
classified salary grid that
 
03:06:22.710 --> 03:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
realistically function as if they were
 
03:06:24.550 --> 03:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
salaried employees
 
03:06:26.870 --> 03:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
um but don't actually function that way
 
03:06:27.590 --> 03:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
because they're
 
03:06:29.510 --> 03:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
they're hourly they do an hourly time
 
03:06:30.710 --> 03:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
card and
 
03:06:33.510 --> 03:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
and it's you have to be careful about
 
03:06:35.670 --> 03:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
you know calling them after hours or
 
03:06:38.230 --> 03:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
it's 4 30 we can't still be meeting um
 
03:06:39.190 --> 03:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
and things like that
 
03:06:41.110 --> 03:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
so they would they would become like all
 
03:06:42.790 --> 03:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
other senior leadership positions
 
03:06:47.190 --> 03:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:50.389 --> 03:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
so christopher also in part one after
 
03:06:52.309 --> 03:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
after we go through the just the
 
03:06:53.510 --> 03:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
boilerplate stuff
 
03:06:56.630 --> 03:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
to codify jason
 
03:06:59.830 --> 03:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
there is a change being
 
03:07:03.110 --> 03:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
placed here on the chairmanship of that
 
03:07:07.349 --> 03:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
actual committee to to go from a
 
03:07:10.150 --> 03:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
rotation of an annual chairmanship to
 
03:07:13.990 --> 03:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:16.309 --> 03:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
so that's um i think i can speak to that
 
03:07:18.230 --> 03:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure for sure that's not
 
03:07:19.750 --> 03:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's not actually our amendment that's a
 
03:07:20.710 --> 03:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
decision that
 
03:07:23.750 --> 03:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
the committee itself made and think uh i
 
03:07:24.630 --> 03:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
think what's happened
 
03:07:26.950 --> 03:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
historically is that they've done uh
 
03:07:28.630 --> 03:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
house member one year senate member one
 
03:07:30.070 --> 03:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
year to alternate
 
03:07:32.150 --> 03:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
and and i think what they decided maybe
 
03:07:33.750 --> 03:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt will know more
 
03:07:35.590 --> 03:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
but i think what they decided is that
 
03:07:35.600 --> 03:07:37.110 align:start position:0%
but i think what they decided is that
operationally

03:07:37.110 --> 03:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
operationally
 
03:07:40.550 --> 03:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
um that's too much it changes too often
 
03:07:42.150 --> 03:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
and so they still want to switch back
 
03:07:44.150 --> 03:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
and forth between the house and senate
 
03:07:45.670 --> 03:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
but want to have it switch back and
 
03:07:47.670 --> 03:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
forth on the biennium
 
03:07:50.870 --> 03:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
instead of on the anum as it were and i
 
03:07:53.030 --> 03:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
think it's it's for simplicity's sake
 
03:07:56.710 --> 03:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
and and because so many things um
 
03:07:59.349 --> 03:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
so many things cross an annual line you
 
03:08:00.309 --> 03:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
know you might have a meeting in
 
03:08:00.319 --> 03:08:01.349 align:start position:0%
know you might have a meeting in
december

03:08:01.349 --> 03:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
december
 
03:08:02.870 --> 03:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
and then the follow-up meeting is in
 
03:08:04.630 --> 03:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
january or february
 
03:08:08.070 --> 03:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
um and it's a year whereas typically
 
03:08:10.309 --> 03:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
um if you use the election year as the
 
03:08:10.319 --> 03:08:11.269 align:start position:0%
um if you use the election year as the
barometer

03:08:11.269 --> 03:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
barometer
 
03:08:13.349 --> 03:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
things don't actually cross over on that
 
03:08:14.309 --> 03:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's
 
03:08:16.389 --> 03:08:16.399 align:start position:0%
i think it's it's simply operational
 
03:08:16.399 --> 03:08:17.670 align:start position:0%
i think it's it's simply operational
efficiency

03:08:17.670 --> 03:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
03:08:20.389 --> 03:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
um so that instead of it being
 
03:08:22.150 --> 03:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt one year
 
03:08:24.870 --> 03:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
and senator reagan the next it would be
 
03:08:26.790 --> 03:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
representative of schmidt one biennium
 
03:08:29.429 --> 03:08:29.439 align:start position:0%
or whoever um and senator reagan the
 
03:08:29.439 --> 03:08:29.830 align:start position:0%
or whoever um and senator reagan the
next

03:08:29.830 --> 03:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
next
 
03:08:32.830 --> 03:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
and i think it's just for operational
 
03:08:32.840 --> 03:08:35.670 align:start position:0%
and i think it's just for operational
purposes

03:08:35.670 --> 03:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
03:08:38.389 --> 03:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
so as far as part one goes with this do
 
03:08:39.590 --> 03:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
we have any uh
 
03:08:45.030 --> 03:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:48.230 --> 03:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
remember that i'm sure thank you mr
 
03:08:48.240 --> 03:08:49.269 align:start position:0%
remember that i'm sure thank you mr
chair

03:08:49.269 --> 03:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:08:52.070 --> 03:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon commissioner i'm
 
03:08:52.080 --> 03:08:52.630 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon commissioner i'm
curious

03:08:52.630 --> 03:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
curious
 
03:08:55.910 --> 03:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that um
 
03:08:59.190 --> 03:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
with the hourly employees that
 
03:09:01.750 --> 03:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
say you're in a meeting and it's going
 
03:09:01.760 --> 03:09:02.870 align:start position:0%
say you're in a meeting and it's going
beyond

03:09:02.870 --> 03:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
03:09:06.870 --> 03:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
4 30 their time to quit work
 
03:09:10.630 --> 03:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
um what happens if they should stay
 
03:09:12.710 --> 03:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
beyond that
 
03:09:15.590 --> 03:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
well in the under the current scheme
 
03:09:16.389 --> 03:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:09:19.670 --> 03:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
there are significant um there's a
 
03:09:21.510 --> 03:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
significant body of regulation that the
 
03:09:24.070 --> 03:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
federal government has under flsa
 
03:09:26.950 --> 03:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
the i think that's fair labor standards
 
03:09:26.960 --> 03:09:27.830 align:start position:0%
the i think that's fair labor standards
act

03:09:27.830 --> 03:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
act
 
03:09:30.389 --> 03:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
and um um there are a whole bunch of
 
03:09:32.150 --> 03:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations some of them deal
 
03:09:32.160 --> 03:09:32.469 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations some of them deal
with

03:09:32.469 --> 03:09:32.479 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:09:34.150 --> 03:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
the distinctions between exempt and
 
03:09:35.750 --> 03:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
non-exempt which
 
03:09:38.150 --> 03:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
um in most private businesses in most
 
03:09:39.429 --> 03:09:39.439 align:start position:0%
states frankly
 
03:09:42.229 --> 03:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
um tip are typically not exclusively but
 
03:09:43.910 --> 03:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
typically based on salary level where
 
03:09:45.269 --> 03:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
people are treated
 
03:09:47.269 --> 03:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
somewhat differently you know certain
 
03:09:48.790 --> 03:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
employees and and you can
 
03:09:50.710 --> 03:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
understand this think about like our
 
03:09:51.830 --> 03:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
grounds crew
 
03:09:53.269 --> 03:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
they are early employees they're meant
 
03:09:55.110 --> 03:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
to be hourly employees and and
 
03:09:56.389 --> 03:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
and they're very strict rules and
 
03:09:58.870 --> 03:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
regulations whereas managerial positions
 
03:10:00.309 --> 03:10:00.319 align:start position:0%
are treated differently because of the
 
03:10:03.670 --> 03:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:06.229 --> 03:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
you must work a 37 and a half hour week
 
03:10:07.830 --> 03:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
you must keep a time card that is
 
03:10:10.469 --> 03:10:10.479 align:start position:0%
accurate for a 37 and a half hour week
 
03:10:13.110 --> 03:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
if you work a 38th or 39th hour you must
 
03:10:13.120 --> 03:10:13.510 align:start position:0%
if you work a 38th or 39th hour you must
be

03:10:13.510 --> 03:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:10:17.030 --> 03:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
paid an additional x
 
03:10:21.190 --> 03:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
per hour for that the statutes
 
03:10:25.190 --> 03:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
or i'm sorry the budget tends to not
 
03:10:26.870 --> 03:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
allow for overtime there's some
 
03:10:28.550 --> 03:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
positions that it does and you budget
 
03:10:29.269 --> 03:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
for them
 
03:10:31.190 --> 03:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
but not for that so you there are very
 
03:10:32.389 --> 03:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
strict sort of
 
03:10:35.190 --> 03:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations on on you know
 
03:10:36.630 --> 03:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
what time did you get here did you hear
 
03:10:39.030 --> 03:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
it here at 8 10 or at 8 12.
 
03:10:42.550 --> 03:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
um did you leave at 4 30 or 4 36 if i
 
03:10:45.429 --> 03:10:45.439 align:start position:0%
uh send you a text at home at night you
 
03:10:46.229 --> 03:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
know i'm
 
03:10:48.710 --> 03:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
obviously doing a lot of work at night
 
03:10:51.269 --> 03:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
um and if i send you a text or an email
 
03:10:52.870 --> 03:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
at home you should not open it until
 
03:10:54.389 --> 03:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
first thing in the morning
 
03:10:55.590 --> 03:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
and you know there are a lot of
 
03:10:58.070 --> 03:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
employees who just don't worry about it
 
03:10:59.510 --> 03:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
and do it anyway
 
03:11:01.750 --> 03:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
technically you're in violation right
 
03:11:01.760 --> 03:11:02.550 align:start position:0%
technically you're in violation right
where

03:11:02.550 --> 03:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:11:03.990 --> 03:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
where you know they they're not meant to
 
03:11:05.590 --> 03:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
come in on a saturday
 
03:11:07.830 --> 03:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
because if you come in on a saturday i
 
03:11:09.110 --> 03:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
have to pay you and i didn't
 
03:11:10.630 --> 03:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
and i'm not budgeted for that so you
 
03:11:13.110 --> 03:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
must stay home we early in my tenure
 
03:11:14.389 --> 03:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
here there was an employee who was
 
03:11:17.190 --> 03:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
disciplined for working too much
 
03:11:20.630 --> 03:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
and um and it just it felt really weird
 
03:11:20.640 --> 03:11:21.110 align:start position:0%
and um and it just it felt really weird
right

03:11:21.110 --> 03:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:11:23.030 --> 03:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
like we were giving someone a hard time
 
03:11:24.309 --> 03:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
for working too much
 
03:11:26.309 --> 03:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
and it was because they had no budget
 
03:11:27.990 --> 03:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
for overtime
 
03:11:31.269 --> 03:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
and and um and she said i don't care i'm
 
03:11:32.710 --> 03:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
gonna put in for it
 
03:11:35.590 --> 03:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
and her manager said i can't i i can't
 
03:11:36.630 --> 03:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
let you
 
03:11:39.110 --> 03:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
decide to ignore that and she said this
 
03:11:40.150 --> 03:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
is ridiculous
 
03:11:42.389 --> 03:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
you know i'm making 90 000 a year
 
03:11:43.830 --> 03:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
whatever she made it was something like
 
03:11:43.840 --> 03:11:44.630 align:start position:0%
whatever she made it was something like
that

03:11:44.630 --> 03:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:11:47.510 --> 03:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
and it's it's you know i'm working a
 
03:11:48.630 --> 03:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
38th hour
 
03:11:51.349 --> 03:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not doing 75 hours a week i'm just
 
03:11:53.110 --> 03:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
working an extra half hour to
 
03:11:55.429 --> 03:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
catch up on stuff it's like i'm sorry
 
03:11:56.950 --> 03:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
you're not you're not a salaried
 
03:11:58.710 --> 03:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
employee you're an hourly employee and
 
03:12:00.469 --> 03:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
we have to treat you as such
 
03:12:03.269 --> 03:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
and um and i'm not critical of that
 
03:12:04.070 --> 03:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
because those those
 
03:12:06.309 --> 03:12:06.319 align:start position:0%
restrictions are in place to protect
 
03:12:08.389 --> 03:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
employees from abuse from supervisors
 
03:12:08.399 --> 03:12:08.710 align:start position:0%
employees from abuse from supervisors
and

03:12:08.710 --> 03:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:12:11.910 --> 03:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
and um but in the most senior positions
 
03:12:13.429 --> 03:12:13.439 align:start position:0%
in state government
 
03:12:15.830 --> 03:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's it's more than reasonable
 
03:12:18.229 --> 03:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
to expect people to be salaried
 
03:12:20.309 --> 03:12:20.319 align:start position:0%
and the only and they expect it too
 
03:12:21.590 --> 03:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
frankly they're they're
 
03:12:23.030 --> 03:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
if you start from the outside you just
 
03:12:25.429 --> 03:12:25.439 align:start position:0%
think it's weird um
 
03:12:28.950 --> 03:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
and so um we're taking
 
03:12:31.190 --> 03:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
only our most senior positions because
 
03:12:32.309 --> 03:12:32.319 align:start position:0%
you know beyond that you
 
03:12:33.349 --> 03:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
there are all kinds of other
 
03:12:34.550 --> 03:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
considerations you would have to get
