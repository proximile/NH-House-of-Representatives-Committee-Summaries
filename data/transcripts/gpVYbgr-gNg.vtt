so this year this
 
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 align:start position:0%

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 align:start position:0%

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 align:start position:0%

so far those are shaded in gray so
 
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
starting right off the bat um la in row
 
00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
number one safety's additional
 
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs if you recall
 
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
um as part of their budget presentation
 
00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 align:start position:0%
the department had
 
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
i believe it was close to 60 separate
 
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.070 align:start position:0%
i believe it was close to 60 separate
items

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
items
 
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
that they had ranked in a priority order
 
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.430 align:start position:0%
that they had ranked in a priority order
for

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
the division to consider because they do
 
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
have a mixed funding
 
00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
situation at the department of safety
 
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
you'll see this request
 
00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
spread out between line row 1 rule 14
 
00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
and row 22.
 
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
this is the uh the total of all i think
 
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
it was 59
 
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
prioritized requests so that's what the
 
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
safety additional prioritized needs
 
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.629 align:start position:0%
safety additional prioritized needs
represents

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
represents
 
00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
okay so these were the uh the extra
 
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh forensic people yeah so all the
 
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
positions they requested
 
00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
uh there was some other i mean i think
 
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
there was some facility maintenance
 
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
money at one of the requests
 
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
i'd have to pull the list but there it
 
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
was expensive as you remember quite a
 
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
few positions
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh to be funded was the lion's share of
 
00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
their requests
 
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
okay so uh i think we better hold off on
 
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
this one
 
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
until we see what's uh
 
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
what's going on with the general fund
 
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
so representative murray you have a
 
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.830 align:start position:0%
so representative murray you have a
question

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you just so i understand so
 
00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.950 align:start position:0%
yes thank you just so i understand so
the

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
total of what safety is requesting
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
across these three agencies
 
00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
is around the total is around 10 to 11
 
00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:08.150 align:start position:0%
is around the total is around 10 to 11
million

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
if i'm looking at one and 14
 
00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
and 22 or yeah if you add all that would
 
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
fund 100
 
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
of their requests that's around between
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
10 and 11 if i'm adding really fast
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
between those three actually it's
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
general highway and then that other is
 
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
the combination of several other sources
 
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
of funds but yes
 
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
in total funds it's around 10 11 million
 
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so mary i'm telling you you gotta
 
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
water that and fertilize it
 
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh the next two items there are
 
00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
um full funding for um
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
the community college and uh the
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
university system
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to
 
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
pass over those as well at this point
 
00:07:59.189 --> 00:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
um i would
 
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know i would love to be able to uh
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
provide additional money but i i just
 
00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:06.790 align:start position:0%
provide additional money but i i just
don't

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
uh the education
 
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
is looking for two million dollars
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
for a student information data system
 
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
again a worthy cause
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
um but i don't i don't see us
 
00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
um the next one
 
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
is a hundred and eight thousand
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
to move a position from federal funds to
 
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
mickey do you want to talk to us about
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
this one oh i'm sorry mary
 
00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
our representative heath you have a hand
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
up um i just i
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say that i did agree with
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
you about that line in education
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
i think um now is not the time to do
 
00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:58.790 align:start position:0%
i think um now is not the time to do
that

00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
so um i think that we will agree with
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
you on that
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
so so this was one of the requests that
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
the department of ed had brought forward
 
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
that they have a position that's
 
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
currently in a federally funded
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
in the governor's recommended budget and
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
they are seeking to
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
reload relocate that position to be
 
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
funded through general funds
 
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
they i think testified that um
 
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
that position could not be funded where
 
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
it is now and they're just seeking to
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
keep it existing
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
or keep it up an existing position but
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
it would just move to general funds so
 
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
to do this change if you look at line 33
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
down below we would reduce the federal
 
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:39.670 align:start position:0%
down below we would reduce the federal
fund

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
appropriations in the budget and
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
increase general funds so this would be
 
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
about a
 
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
225 000 increase to your general fund
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh spending if you were to approve this
 
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.150 align:start position:0%
uh spending if you were to approve this
item

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
and we don't we don't have that in the
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
host bill one amendments
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
separate document today so that's just
 
00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
for you to be aware of and if
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
as an example if any of these items
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
someone on the committee wishes to make
 
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
a motion and you know i want to fund
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
this i want to
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
you know i think the chair will
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
accommodate that i can also prepare for
 
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:14.870 align:start position:0%
accommodate that i can also prepare for
you

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
kind of a specific sheet similar to the
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
house bill one items i sent to last
 
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.350 align:start position:0%
house bill one items i sent to last
night

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
night
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
for any of these agency requests
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
yep i i agree but um
 
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
i think we're we're all cognizant of
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
where the
 
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh where the general fund stands and
 
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
work and uh i don't know
 
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
whether any of that money will
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
come to division 2
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
or if it will all go to division 1
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
and division 3 which have much larger
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
um general fund requirements
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
than we do but again we may
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't want to take them off
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
because surprise you know mary's money
 
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.030 align:start position:0%
because surprise you know mary's money
tree

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
tree
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
comes through for us so representative
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
heath you have a question
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
oh thank you um mickey did the
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
department give you a rationale of why
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
they wanted to move that
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
position is it they have to show
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort or
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
is there a sound reason i i
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
i can double check with them they
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
brought this up to the the committee
 
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
when they are before us as one of their
 
00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:40.959 align:start position:0%
requests i can look back at the item i
 
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
don't know if it just had to do with
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
there's not the federal money
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
there to fund that position they
 
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
expected but they wanted to keep the
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
position or
 
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh it could have just been it was just
 
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
inappropriately funded in the wrong area
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
to begin with so
 
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
i can get that information for you and
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
um and follow back up
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
i yeah my my question was really sort of
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
basically along the same line as
 
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
representative heath just asked
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
the the only thing uh mickey that would
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
concern me
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
is um if the
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
if if the situation was that this was a
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
federally funded position that
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
the the person in the position wasn't
 
00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.350 align:start position:0%
the the person in the position wasn't
really

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
doing what the federal requirements
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
sort of required and you know that
 
00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.389 align:start position:0%
sort of required and you know that
safety

00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
sort of didn't didn't want to get rid of
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
the person but was
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
so was just sort of finding a job for
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
them with uh
 
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
with general funds if so in other words
 
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying is
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
i would be interested to know if it's
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
really necessary
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
to have this position because if it's
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
not then that you know that
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
makes a difference i think yep i will uh
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
i'll certainly reach out to them to get
 
00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
a further explanation of
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
of why this request has come forward
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
um was truly a um
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
a budget mistake i guess when they
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
loaded the budget and put the position
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
in the wrong area
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
or if it is uh something beyond that so
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
i'll get i'll get additional info for
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you very much uh
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
okay uh the net
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
mickey i thought you were putting things
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
on here that we could all agree with
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
well i do have those um on the next the
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
next document so
 
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
this is a good document just to this is
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
a kind of our entire
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
universe so to speak we've got a house
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
bill 2 document as well that captures
 
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.550 align:start position:0%
bill 2 document as well that captures
everything

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
this is really all the requests for
 
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
budget changes here so there's going to
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
be some tough items here to discuss
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
you're not going to probably get through
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
them today
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
um but this at least i hope will
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
help the committee members to kind of
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
get a grasp of the full picture here
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
that was the idea of these
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
okay um the next one is
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
um external support for the new board of
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
trustees for unification plan
 
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
again until we decide where
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
we stand on the unification plan i
 
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
okay additional uh prioritized needs
 
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
from transportation
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
we've already covered the safety mickey
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
is this money within
 
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
this request here the additional
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs the department brought
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
forward would be all highway funds
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
so this is a money for equipment this is
 
00:14:54.959 --> 00:14:56.069 align:start position:0%
so this is a money for equipment this is
other

00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
maintenance efforts that they had
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
brought forward that they would like to
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
fund in the next two years the
 
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
conway bypass payback would be included
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
in this this is just all their
 
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:03.990 align:start position:0%
in this this is just all their
additional

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
funding needs that are not currently
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
included in the budget
 
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
okay so and and there's not sufficient
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
dollars in the highway fund to cover
 
00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:13.590 align:start position:0%
dollars in the highway fund to cover
these

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
no i mean as of right now with the
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
actions that have taken place to this
 
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:18.470 align:start position:0%
actions that have taken place to this
point

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
um we're about one and a half million
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
one point six million dollars in the
 
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.790 align:start position:0%
one point six million dollars in the
deficit

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
deficit
 
00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
the committee had discussed uh winter
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
maintenance line as a place to
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
address that as a way to balance the
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
i'm carrying that down below on this
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
document if you see at the very bottom
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
just other
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
items to consider so if the committee
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
wants to
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
explore that at another time i don't
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
have a change sheet prepared for that
 
00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.389 align:start position:0%
have a change sheet prepared for that
today

00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
but i know that's something that the
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
committee had discussed as an area to
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
this is in fish and game oh mary d i'm
 
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
sorry representative heath did you have
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madame chair just a quick
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
question um to mickey
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
um if we were to use that winter
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
maintenance money
 
00:16:06.839 --> 00:16:08.550 align:start position:0%
maintenance money
um

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
so it ultimately would mean that the
 
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
accounting unit with the appropriations
 
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
to fund the winter maintenance
 
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.350 align:start position:0%
to fund the winter maintenance
operations

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
would be reduced by i mean just using
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
round number probably eight hundred
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year from the
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
governor's level
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
it would still have it funded at a
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
higher level than we've had in the last
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
few budgets
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
and the department still has their
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
existing statutory authority to come to
 
00:16:34.639 --> 00:16:35.189 align:start position:0%
existing statutory authority to come to
fiscal

00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
and request funds from the highway fund
 
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
if there are
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
any available to cover any shortfalls
 
00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
they have in that area come
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
the realizations of a winter so
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
it's somewhat business as usual for
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
budget writers in the last uh
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
few terms but even after a reduction
 
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
that we would need to do
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
to balance the highway fund for division
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
two it's still a higher appropriation
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
level than
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
has been in the last few budgets so that
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
that's a good place for us to work from
 
00:17:03.279 --> 00:17:04.549 align:start position:0%
that's a good place for us to work from
tonight

00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
tonight
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mickey i i
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
was just a little confused by what you
 
00:17:11.439 --> 00:17:12.150 align:start position:0%
was just a little confused by what you
said

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
when you say it's it would be a higher
 
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.829 align:start position:0%
when you say it's it would be a higher
appropriation

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
for equipment nope and i'm sorry winter
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
not equipment okay i'm sorry yeah okay
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
this would all be a winter maintenance
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
um is what i'm referring to
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
with that reduction that we had talked
 
00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:30.390 align:start position:0%
with that reduction that we had talked
about

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
okay so um we could balance the highway
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
fund with winter maintenance
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
and still have a little bit leftovers is
 
00:17:38.799 --> 00:17:40.789 align:start position:0%
and still have a little bit leftovers is
that

00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
even the the net budget that would
 
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
remain after the reduction you would
 
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
need to balance the highway fund is
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
still a
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
healthy appropriation level compared to
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
prior budgets
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
we also i don't think it's in the
 
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
package today
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
but dot has
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
asked for authority
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
to use any extra lapse money
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
to fund winter maintenance
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm sorry i don't i don't know what
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
the lapse number
 
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
is right now it's in one of the pieces
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
of paper that we have here
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
um but if they lapse
 
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
more than that then they would want to
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
put it
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
against uh equipment
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
so um we'll that's just something
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
else to put in your brain uh
 
00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
in regards to um funding

00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
okay uh fish and game
 
00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
a hatchery manager petition a
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
position and um
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
we did get a letter from
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
fish and game asking for this to occur
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative heath um i just
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
think the fishing game
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair fishing game is
 
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
healthier than it's ever been
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
i think they have a revenue that if they
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
want to fund this position
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
that they just take it out of their own
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
little budget
 
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
but can i answer one more question too
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
while we're talking about dot
 
00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
they have a really high um a really high
 
00:20:03.679 --> 00:20:03.990 align:start position:0%
they have a really high um a really high
uh

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
amount that has to go to um
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
the doit um and i just um
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
i'm not asking that right now but just
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
something that i would like to inquire
 
00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:15.350 align:start position:0%
something that i would like to inquire
about

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah and oh by the way
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to be given a larger piece
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
what do we what do we want to do with
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
um this uh
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
unfunded hatchery manager position
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
represent murray thank you i agree with
 
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
representative heath i think this money
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
is maybe better used in
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
many other places and they are healthy
 
00:20:58.559 --> 00:20:59.029 align:start position:0%
many other places and they are healthy
um

00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
it seems to me they should be able to
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
fund it themselves
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
just to clarify this request for the
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
department of the fishing game
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
department is to use their federal and
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
their fish and game funds to fund it so
 
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
so can i share my screen representative
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
i know we all have the documents but it
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
may be easier for me to
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
share just so everyone's clear what
 
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking to at each time
 
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:25.990 align:start position:0%
we're talking to at each time
sure

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
so hopefully you all can see the pdf
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
here for the
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
hb1 amendment requested by fish and game
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
not yet
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
can you see it yes okay
 
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
so this was in the packet that i sent
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
out to everybody last night so this kind
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
of breaks down what the fish and game
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
department is looking to do
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
um so you can see
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
the source of funds for this request are
 
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.029 align:start position:0%
the source of funds for this request are
75

00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
75
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
federal and 25 or close to a fish and
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
game funds so
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
the the net impact to the fish and game
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
fund is very small
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
they have a healthy surplus right now a
 
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
healthy budget um
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
so i to me there's not a whole lot to
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
this request
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%

the three items for education
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
on the bottom i think is um
 
00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
you know we've talked about a couple of
 
00:25:01.279 --> 00:25:02.390 align:start position:0%
you know we've talked about a couple of
them

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
but right now we're just gonna have to
 
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.750 align:start position:0%
but right now we're just gonna have to
um

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
pass over those well i i will just
 
00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:09.669 align:start position:0%
pass over those well i i will just
clarify

00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
these are other funds so the first one
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
the credentialing
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
is 100 paid for from the credentialing
 
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
fund that the commissioner had brought
 
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
forward with their
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
restructured budget request as well as
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
adding a position
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
in that area and then the next growth 32
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
is the department's awarded grants has
 
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
been awarded grants from the governor's
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
commission on alcohol
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
and other drugs and they missed the
 
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
budget they had multiple grants one of
 
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
them was already in the budget these two
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
didn't get put in so they're just asking
 
00:25:37.919 --> 00:25:38.630 align:start position:0%
didn't get put in so they're just asking
to

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
recognize these uh other funded grants
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
so there's no general fund impact to
 
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.390 align:start position:0%
so there's no general fund impact to
these

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
these these first two okay
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
and when i so i'll show you the
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
this this is the picture and the change
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
that they're looking to do for
 
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.190 align:start position:0%
that they're looking to do for
credentialing

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
credentialing
 
00:25:59.430 --> 00:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
and we can start with that one first or
 
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
you could do them
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
in a block if you want and then here's
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
the requests for the um
 
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
grants that were that missed the budget
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
that they'd like to add in
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
so as you can see transfers from other
 
00:26:11.039 --> 00:26:11.750 align:start position:0%
so as you can see transfers from other
agencies

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
there's no general funds impacts here
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
there's no state funds same thing with
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
credentialing this is all from
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
sorry about that it looked really good
 
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:58.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
well mickey doesn't want to screen share
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
with us
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
but i i uh i can tell you these are in
 
00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.110 align:start position:0%
but i i uh i can tell you these are in
the

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
it's no it's we understand it
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative heath um i would be
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
comfortable moving
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
the motion for number 31 the
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
position funded um in credentialing
 
00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
um i do know that credentialing should
 
00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:43.830 align:start position:0%
um i do know that credentialing should
be

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
pretty healthy uh we i did ask for an
 
00:27:47.039 --> 00:27:47.669 align:start position:0%
pretty healthy uh we i did ask for an
amount

00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
that they have um in that line but i
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
never did get a response from the
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
commissioner on that
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
but um from my prior knowledge that that
 
00:27:58.389 --> 00:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
was something that
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
there's always plenty of funds there and
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
the other position
 
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:04.310 align:start position:0%
the um position
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:06.789 align:start position:0%
the um position
[Music]

00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:06.799 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
um i would add that too
 
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
add the uh position for and for
 
00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
uh credentialing and the
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%

i think i could add the um
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
the request from the doe to
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
this right mickey
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%

uh dollars that they hadn't listed in
their

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%

for those two positions we'll just leave
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
i think at this point as long as
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
everyone's comfortable and understands
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
everything we just went through that's
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
kind of everything that's in play
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's been discussed in the committee
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
at this time um
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
and i know i've been working with some
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
members on some house bill 1 amendments
 
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
for future work sessions
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
and i'll update this document as we meet
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
to shade what we've already approved add
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
some new ideas that you know anyone
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
wants to bring forward so this will be a
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
working document we'll update each time
 
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
i think now we can go to the file that i
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
sent that was called
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
hb2 tracking document which is
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh essentially lists all of the existing
 
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 sections
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
as well as some amendments that were
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
sent out last night as well to consider
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
i'd love to share my screen because i
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
think it would help but zoom's not
 
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
cooperating today
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
for some reason so i'll try one
 
00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
but it is the one that at the top says
 
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
hb1 slash hb2
 
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
sections to consider oh is the screen
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
working now looks like it might be
 
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
yes it is okay
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
so we can go through each of these if
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
you'd like
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
and there's quite a few that i feel the
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
committee has had
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
consensus on and probably not going to
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
offer any amendments or changes to
 
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
what's already in the bill
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
and those could be ones that the
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
division wants to take up today to at
 
00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.190 align:start position:0%
division wants to take up today to at
least

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
least
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
have them behind us i've got a super
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
easy one to start with
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
if you'd like so for those that have
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
been on the committee before in
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
the back of house bill 1 one of those
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
back of the budget sections there's some
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
boilerplate language for the lottery
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
commission to have authority to
 
00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
essentially purchase their tickets that
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
they sell
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
it's never a section that we've ever
 
00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
really changed it provides the
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
authority for them year after year it's
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
a like i said it's a boilerplate
 
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
budget section it resides on page 717 of
 
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
the house bill one document itself that
 
00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.070 align:start position:0%
the house bill one document itself that
we

00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
aren't even really working from right
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
now um section four
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
so customarily we when we have a section
 
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to want to change
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
we would usually still vote and say
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
accept it as it is you know or no change
 
00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:10.789 align:start position:0%
accept it as it is you know or no change
or

00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
however you want to word it
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
representative burger
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
that way it'll let us know when we
 
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
assemble these bills later
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
for the finance committee we know what's

in and what's out
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
is there a reason why this has never
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
gotten into statute
 
00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
no it it's just always been in house
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
bill one and
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's got a fixed dollar amount
 
00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.430 align:start position:0%

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
you know it changes each budget but it's
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh it's kind of just been the general
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
authority that lottery
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%

already tell i can't scroll up and down
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
or go to pages for the committee so
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna step out here and let andrea
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
share the same document we were just
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:02.839 --> 00:38:08.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
sorry about that i don't know what's uh
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
what the challenge is for me today but
 
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
there is one well
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
here's the deal mickey it's always a
 
00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:22.390 align:start position:0%
here's the deal mickey it's always a
challenge

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
maybe you should have worn green that's
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
true i thought my first name was enough
 
00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:27.330 align:start position:0%
but i guess not
 
00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:29.589 align:start position:0%
but i guess not
[Laughter]

00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
in my house we always turn it off and
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
turn it back on and
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
it works thank you andrea
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
um so i'd say the next the next sections
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
in house bill 245 and 46 are relative to
 
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
the calculation of adequate education
 
00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:46.390 align:start position:0%
the calculation of adequate education
grants

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
grants
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think we're probably getting
 
00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
into that today
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
so we can probably skip skip that
 
00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.109 align:start position:0%
so we can probably skip skip that
representative

00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
i think that's a very good idea okay
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
i would go down yeah i would go down to
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
number 30.
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
okay we do have an amendment possibly
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
that could impact uh
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
line 20 or page 22 section 47.
 
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
so in house bill 2 now there's
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
an edit to the education trust fund
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
revenue in that
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
if tobacco settlement funds are less
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
than 40 million dollars a year
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
which is the case it just makes it clear
 
00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:23.670 align:start position:0%
which is the case it just makes it clear
that

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's the amount that goes to the
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
education trust fund it's nothing more
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
than a clerical
 
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
technical change that the governor's
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
office recommended putting in there and
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
we agree with
 
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
um the only reason i say to bring this
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
one up is
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
you can either accept it as is or in
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
your amendment packet
 
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
amendment number zero six nine three
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
h amends this section if you recall one
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
of the things that
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
um division two is going to have to
 
00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:53.430 align:start position:0%
um division two is going to have to
address

00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
is to allow for the education trust fund
 
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
to be used for school building aid
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
tuition and transportation aid
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
special education aid as we did in the
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
current budget
 
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
last year in house bill 2 that authority
 
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
was only granted for the biennium only
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
the budget does the same thing this time
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
around out of the governor's office and
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
likely will add a division two
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
so we need to amend house bill 2 to
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
allow for this
 
00:40:23.109 --> 00:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
there's two amendments that do this one
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
codifies it
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
and makes it so this change will be in
 
00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.829 align:start position:0%
and makes it so this change will be in
perpetuity

00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
perpetuity
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
that's amendment zero six nine three h
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
zero six
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
nine four h does what we did last time
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
and makes that
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
authority for the biennium only so
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
you would only as a division recommend
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
one of those
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
it really comes down to do you want that
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund to be used for
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
these programs for the biennium only or
 
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
in perpetuity
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay so what you're saying is that we
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
could in fact
 
00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
um vote on
 
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.309 align:start position:0%
um vote on
47

00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
yep and you would uh vote on 47
 
00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
to change it to make that change that i
 
00:41:11.589 --> 00:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
was just talking about statutory it
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
would amend this section because 47
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
affects that same section of law or
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
um just put it in a chapter law for two
 
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
years if you want that
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
authority for me two years only so it's
 
00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.309 align:start position:0%
authority for me two years only so it's
really

00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
up to the committee what policy you want
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
to set for using the education trust on
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
representative heath um actually i think
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative maru was before me
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry representative murray oh
 
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you it's all it does either way is
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
fine with me
 
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
i'm just having a hard time parsing
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
lines 34 35 and 36 it doesn't seem to be
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
is it written correctly
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
is there something that's not here that
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
i'm supposed to know about from another
 
00:41:53.359 --> 00:41:54.230 align:start position:0%
i'm supposed to know about from another
document

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
but i don't understand frankly the
 
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
sentence to be
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
blunt now
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
can someone tell me what document you're
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
looking at please
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
hp2 thank you yeah
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
what it what it's saying is that
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
if um the tobacco settlement
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
has been 40 million
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
for many years however
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
if it's less than 40 million
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
we still want to accept that money
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
into the education trust fund
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
so even if it's less than 40 million all
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
that money goes to
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
the trust fund that's correct is that
 
00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
what it says
 
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
i think that's yes i think i think
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
that's what it says
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
so the law is 40 million goes to the
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
education trust fund anything
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
extra would have gone to the general
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
fund the total amount now is anticipated
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
to be less than 40.
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
so this just clarifies it won't be 40.
 
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
it'll either be 40 or whatever the
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
actual amount is so it just provides
 
00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
clarification that because i think it's
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
like we're at 37.9
 
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
is what the revenue estimates have for
 
00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
the uh tobacco settlement this time
 
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
so it's just clear that it's not always
 
00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
going to be 40 it'll be
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
either 40 or whatever the actual amount
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
is okay thank you it's hard for me to
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative heath um thank you madam
 
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
chair so
 
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
it just means that it will
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
go on as usual to the trust fund
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
only the amount is not the 40 million
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's that simple yeah there's no actual
 
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
change to this it was a
 
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
i think a technical recommendation from
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
the comptroller's office is my
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
understanding of where the section
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
okay so um could i have a motion to
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
accept uh
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
do i just need the section 47 well and
 
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
this is this is where it's up to
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative do you want
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
because if you do want to make that
 
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
education trust fund change i was
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
talking about statutory it would amend
 
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
the same law as section 47 so we would
 
00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.150 align:start position:0%
the same law as section 47 so we would
just

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
merge it into section 47. so
 
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
do you does the committee want to make
 
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
uses open for the biennium only or make
 
00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
that a
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
statutory change moving forward that's
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
what it comes down to and then
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
we would do one of those two amendments
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
vicky would you say that again please
 
00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:43.839 align:start position:0%
sure yeah mickey i think i think at this
 
00:44:43.839 --> 00:44:44.630 align:start position:0%
sure yeah mickey i think i think at this
point

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
we will just vote on 47
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
okay and then we'll
 
00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.750 align:start position:0%
okay and then we'll
um

00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
we'll look at 48
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
but um i think this one is easy no
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
no go ahead representative
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh that's uh chairman
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
i've previewed both of the amendments
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
that mickey's talking about and i i
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
would actually like to see
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh 0.693h in there
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if we have to you know
 
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
pass 47 first or go straight to the
 
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
amendment but i'd like to propose that
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
one please
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
so that amendment does include the
 
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
underlying section 47
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
so that would be essentially supporting
 
00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.030 align:start position:0%
so that would be essentially supporting
47

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
47
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
which i think everyone agrees with and
 
00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
then that that amendment makes the
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
education trust fund change statutory as
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
far as opening up its uses so
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
yep so that would be that would be a
 
00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.670 align:start position:0%
yep so that would be that would be a
proper

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
proper
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
idea we would plug in that amendment
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
here yep okay so what was the amendment
 
00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.390 align:start position:0%
here yep okay so what was the amendment
number

00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
okay i thought i had all this in one
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative porter
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair i guess i'm a
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
little confused
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
so when we're looking at this document
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
that's on the screen now
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
we're looking at page 22 section 47
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
education trust fund we have to approve
 
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
that that's in the current budget is
 
00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
or we can approve it via
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
one of two amendments
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
that that change i guess i'm confused of
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
what we do do we have to do 47 first
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
or can we do 47
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
just do the amendment no we do not
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
do not what we do not have to approve 47
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
because the
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative turcotte
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
is referring to right um
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
includes both the tobacco settlement
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
and the um
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
the public school business dealing with
 
00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.430 align:start position:0%
the public school business dealing with
uh

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
um right the the fund itself
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
so and i think i understand that but if
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
we decide against
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
both of these amendments do we still
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
have to go back and approve
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
47. that's my question
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
we have to do something with
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
that line yes
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
we have to do something with
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
um the structure of
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund okay
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
we either make it for two years
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
or we make it statutory okay
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
it represents
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
you said zero six three nine
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
are you sure no zero six
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
nine three h okay okay
 
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you my ears were uh my ears were
 
00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.190 align:start position:0%
thank you my ears were uh my ears were
backwards

00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
backwards
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative heath um
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair let's just talk a
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
about the implications of that so
 
00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
in the last session we had
 
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
um a lot of money
 
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
in the trust and and
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
we were in great shape and it was a
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
fabulous use of those funds to do
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
building aid
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
um special ed costs and tnt
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
and it worked really well in the year
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
when there are many years when the
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
education trust
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
does not have those funds and it has to
 
00:49:16.559 --> 00:49:17.030 align:start position:0%
does not have those funds and it has to
draw

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
draw
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
funding from the general fund
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
so just thinking ahead
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
what lawmakers will have to do with
 
00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
future budgets
 
00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:32.220 align:start position:0%
i just am not sure um
 
00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:35.589 align:start position:0%
i just am not sure um
[Music]

00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
of making that change permanent
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
i mean it has advantages and
 
00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.630 align:start position:0%
i mean it has advantages and
disadvantages

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
disadvantages
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
it protects building aid
 
00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
and special ed aid and tnt
 
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
but at the same time trying to balance a
 
00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:54.390 align:start position:0%
but at the same time trying to balance a
budget

00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
and making sure we have sufficient funds
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
i just am not sure of the implications
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
of codifying that um as a permanent
 
00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.589 align:start position:0%
of codifying that um as a permanent
change

00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i i have no problem going either
 
00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:13.750 align:start position:0%
yeah i i have no problem going either
way

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
and i think representative heath makes
 
00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:17.270 align:start position:0%
and i think representative heath makes
some

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
make some good points um
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative do you have any problem
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
um i do not i just preferred the uh
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
zero six nine three
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
yeah well if you know if i would
 
00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
i would prefer that as well but i
 
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
believe that representative heath has
 
00:50:49.119 --> 00:50:49.829 align:start position:0%
believe that representative heath has
made

00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:49.839 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:50:55.349 --> 00:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
an excellent point that um
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
we may not in the future have sufficient
 
00:51:02.069 --> 00:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
uh education trust funds
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
to manage everything that were um
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about but so anyhow
 
00:51:09.359 --> 00:51:10.069 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about but so anyhow
um

00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
representative murray did your hand up
 
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
i did i was just going to ask quickly if
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
would this be something that we could
 
00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:19.030 align:start position:0%
would this be something that we could
consider

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
in the next year so that we have time to
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
consider what representative heath was
 
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean this is uh if if we do it
 
00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.630 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean this is uh if if we do it
temporarily

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
temporarily
 
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
we can always submit a bill because
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
there's really no money tied to it
 
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
you can always submit a bill to make it
 
00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:42.790 align:start position:0%
you can always submit a bill to make it
permanent

00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
and the only other thing i'll clarify is
 
00:51:45.359 --> 00:51:46.230 align:start position:0%
and the only other thing i'll clarify is
these

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:51:48.549 --> 00:51:48.559 align:start position:0%
these amendments make it allowable for
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund to be utilized
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
for these programs it doesn't require
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
budget writers fund these programs from
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund because
 
00:51:58.950 --> 00:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
under current law there's explicit
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
uses for the education trust fund so
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
like you
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
you'd have to change law to use it this
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
just provides
 
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
it opens it up a little bit but
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
certainly in house bill one you could
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
still fund these programs with the
 
00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
general fund if you wanted to you're not
 
00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
required to
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative lynn you had a question i
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sorry i'm i'm
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
i'm a little bit confused i guess i
 
00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:24.390 align:start position:0%
i'm a little bit confused i guess i
don't

00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:27.990 align:start position:0%
don't
um

00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
i understand that that the the issue
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
that we're we're sort of debating
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
is whether we approve this for just the
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
biennium or
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
permanently i guess what i'm not clear
 
00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
where does it say one or the other i'm
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
that that's the thing i'm guessing
 
00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
i'm a little confused about this is the
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
two amendments representative
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
so amendment uh zero six nine
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
three puts it right into rsa um
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
a 1 98 39 whatever it is whereas the
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
other one
 
00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:02.559 align:start position:0%
is just a session law for the biennium
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
only so you would only adopt one of
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
these two amendments depending on which
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
policy you want to set here
 
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
and mickey what's the second amendment
 
00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:10.950 align:start position:0%
and mickey what's the second amendment
number

00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
zero okay
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i know i see it now i'm sorry i see
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative heath uh thank you
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
ma'am care okay i just want to clarify
 
00:53:27.119 --> 00:53:27.430 align:start position:0%
ma'am care okay i just want to clarify
so

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
in my mind i have the right
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
so amendment 0693h
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
allowable uses for the education trust
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
it does not require that to happen year
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
after year
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
but it allows for am i correct mickey
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
correct it it opens up the allowable
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
uses for the education trust fund but
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
it's really all driven by what we
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate in house bill 1 the source
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
of funds
 
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:03.760 align:start position:0%

at the same time approve a
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
footnote in hb1 or do we do that
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
someplace else
 
00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:15.760 align:start position:0%

has the straight delete of this section
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
and then if you look at the following
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
page in
 
00:58:29.829 --> 00:58:29.839 align:start position:0%

of the footnote that we would add right
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
to that appropriation where the line is
 
00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:34.710 align:start position:0%

in
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
police standards budget that way it's
 
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
clear that that appropriation
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
is still for this purpose but uh
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%

damaged by bears where um
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
fish and game will uh take care of
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
whatever it is so um
 
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
are there any and by the way this came
 
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
back from
 
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
um fishing game as
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:45.039 align:start position:0%
representative heath thank you madam
 
01:02:45.039 --> 01:02:45.589 align:start position:0%
representative heath thank you madam
chair

01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
i just need to know what this means
 
01:02:47.839 --> 01:02:50.870 align:start position:0%
i just need to know what this means
mickey

01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's just basically paying
 
01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
for landowners i guess i should say for
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
and the funds for which this will come
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
are the fish and game funds am i correct
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
yeah there's no there's no general funds
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
involved here this is all from their
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
dedicated sources
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
all right thank you okay
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
yes i don't know if you guys have
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
discussed this in committee already i
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
know i kind of parachuted in
 
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
a few days ago had this bill or this
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
section been discussed within committee
 
01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.990 align:start position:0%
section been discussed within committee
yet

01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
yet
 
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh no uh basically any time
 
01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
that there is a
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
policy issue that um
 
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
that goes that is in hb2
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
we send it to the policy committee
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
for their review and they come back
 
01:04:03.029 --> 01:04:03.039 align:start position:0%
and tell us whether they like the policy
 
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
or they don't like the policy
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
and in this case fish and game came back
 
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
and said
 
01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
they liked the policy
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
this is standard that we've been doing
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
for years and years because we are
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:24.839 --> 01:04:28.069 align:start position:0%
 
committee

01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question not really
 
01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:31.990 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question not really
but

01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
well yeah it doesn't doesn't um i guess
 
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
when yeah when fish and game was in
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
um did they talk about this it did not
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
okay but obviously they had no problem
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
with it either
 
01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
no and and i did reach out to see
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
whether this was in or not if it would
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
result in any budgetary change needed
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
and they said no
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
so this purely is a policy section or
 
01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
three sections and um
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon that sections like
 
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
this will appear in house bill 2
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
and i think representative amber hit the
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
nail on the head usually the policy
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
committees do
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh a pine on whether or not they think
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's fine or not
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
and um i think the fishing game chair
 
01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:18.470 align:start position:0%
and um i think the fishing game chair
did

01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
this is just out of curiosity do we know
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
why this section was added into the bill
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
was there a problem with bears and
 
01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
was blossoming in the last year or two
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you
 
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative did you have
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
another question
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
i did it kind of i know it's
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
probably not directly relevant but did
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
did they mention
 
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
i mean how frequently does this happen
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of what
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
are they expecting the actual dollar
 
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
no i there was uh
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
there was nothing mentioned in that uh
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
in that regard
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
by anybody either fish and game or
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
um well
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
uh let's see
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
um represent porter did you have another
 
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
question no madam chair i'm sorry
 
01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative lin i believe you were
 
01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.069 align:start position:0%
representative lin i believe you were
next

01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh yes you know what my my only question
 
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
about fear is this uh
 
01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
um i i guess i
 
01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
questions about the policy that i think
 
01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
maybe representative porter and
 
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte
 
01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
also have but i i understand that our
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
role is not the policy
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
role at this point so i i guess my
 
01:07:17.109 --> 01:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
question is am i understanding that
 
01:07:19.589 --> 01:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
if we vote to approve this on the sort
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
of money
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
issues thing um that's all we're doing
 
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
we're not saying that we necessarily
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
agree with the policy that um
 
01:07:32.789 --> 01:07:32.799 align:start position:0%
i mean eventually when it gets to the
 
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
floor we're gonna we're gonna make a
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
vote that
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh that i guess include would include
 
01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:38.150 align:start position:0%
uh that i guess include would include
both

01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
things but right now we're only
 
01:07:42.069 --> 01:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
approving this the
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
money aspect of it and there really
 
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
isn't any money aspect of this all
 
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
coming out of the
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
fish and game is that is that correct uh
 
01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:51.750 align:start position:0%
fish and game is that is that correct uh
no

01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
because fish and game has told us
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
that this is good policy and so
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is within hb2
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
we are not only putting in the policy
 
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
and agreeing that fish and game is
 
01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:14.799 align:start position:0%
doing whatever they need to do as well
 
01:08:14.799 --> 01:08:15.910 align:start position:0%
doing whatever they need to do as well
as

01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
any money that um
 
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
that the fish and game fund
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
may in fact need to expend
 
01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
so anything that ends up in
 
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
hb2 okay whether it's
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
policy or money
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
is the recommendation from
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
our committee to
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
big finance along with uh
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
eventually to the house for their vote
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
so it's uh
 
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
you know it's both
 
01:08:56.950 --> 01:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
i guess is my thought process on that
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
representative heath
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so the fishing
 
01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:01.990 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so the fishing
game

01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
game
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
this was not generated by fishing game
 
01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
oftentimes agencies will
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
provide any house bill 2 requests that
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
they have
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
to the governor during the development
 
01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
of the governor's recommended budget so
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
this was deemed something from the
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
governor's office as okay to put in
 
01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:33.189 align:start position:0%
governor's office as okay to put in
there

01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
as something that fish and game was
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
looking to have changed rather than
 
01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
a separate bill as you all know that a
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
lot of times agencies will reach out to
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
members to draft a piece of legislation
 
01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
in this case it was something brought to
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
the governor's office and just add it to
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
house bill 2.
 
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
um men of chair by may absolutely
 
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
um you know there's never been a public
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
hearing on this
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
there's never been a conversation really
 
01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
about this
 
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
i just don't feel comfortable um going
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
forward with this
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
amendment i think it it needs to reside
 
01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
in fish and game
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
and there needs to be um a little bit
 
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
more action
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
there are a number of things in hb2 that
 
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
haven't had public hearings
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
and it makes me very concerned and this
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
is one of the areas as well
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
now that i i i'm understanding what this
 
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
means a little bit better
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
so i i don't think i'm going to feel
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable voting yes on this
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i will only say
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
that yesterday was the public hearing
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
on hb2 and the fact that no one chose to
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
speak about this
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
is you know that was their choice
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
and so um when you can't say
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
we didn't have a public hearing uh we
 
01:10:59.910 --> 01:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
had the one yesterday
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
and we also had um
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
fish and game in to talk to us
 
01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
no one from the public commented
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
and i don't believe that there were any
 
01:11:15.679 --> 01:11:17.510 align:start position:0%
and i don't believe that there were any
questions

01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
that were asked about this by
 
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and so
 
01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think that we can say there
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
hasn't been
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
a public hearing and of course
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
i think that my responsibility
 
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that the fish and game
 
01:11:40.239 --> 01:11:41.430 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that the fish and game
committee

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
if in fact it had gone to them would
 
01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:45.030 align:start position:0%
if in fact it had gone to them would
have

01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
approved it and what i got back
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
from fish and game is yes they would
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
approve this if they had said no
 
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
then i would have recommended that we
 
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:04.709 --> 01:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
representative i have um matt
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
from the governor's office here to
 
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
answer any questions perhaps you could
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
provide a little bit of
 
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
backstory to these sections or context i
 
01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:12.070 align:start position:0%
backstory to these sections or context i
think

01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
that would be very helpful that would be
 
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
that would be fine
 
01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairwoman and good to
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
see the members of the committee once
 
01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.270 align:start position:0%
see the members of the committee once
more

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
just to clarify the genesis of this
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
language this was a direct request
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
from the fish and game department and
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
what this language does
 
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
is amends an existing statute to clarify
 
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
that you must be a commercial or in this
 
01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:38.630 align:start position:0%
that you must be a commercial or in this
case

01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
engage in the husbandry or sale of at
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
least a thousand dollars in products
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
to be eligible to be compensated for
 
01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.550 align:start position:0%
to be eligible to be compensated for
damage

01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
damage
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
that is directly uh incurred because of
 
01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:50.709 align:start position:0%
that is directly uh incurred because of
bears

01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
bears
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
right now anyone whether there be a
 
01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
commercial entity or a resident
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
can petition the state to have the state
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
pay for that damage so this
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
adds some more guard rails on what types
 
01:13:04.719 --> 01:13:06.950 align:start position:0%
adds some more guard rails on what types
of

01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
occasions this the state would be in a
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
position to
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
pay for that damage and also clarifies
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
the process
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
and given it some more uh clearly
 
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
defined structures
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
for how these proceedings uh would occur
 
01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
and again this all the direct request of
 
01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative lynn you had johanna
 
01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair can i just ask
 
01:13:34.239 --> 01:13:35.189 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair can i just ask
uh

01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
mr mayor is the idea i mean i i
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
understand that this
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
this what we're voting on now didn't
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
establish this program and i have to be
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
completely honest with you i had no idea
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
um uh before i i came across this in the
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
budget that
 
01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
that the state was paying these kind of
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
things to anybody
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
and so i guess my question is is
 
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
is the rationale behind this
 
01:14:05.669 --> 01:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
that it by offering to pay
 
01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
people for bear damage the theory is
 
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
that they won't resort to self-help and
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
try to shoot the bear if the bear is
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
damaging their crop or whatever because
 
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
there'll be some some kind of
 
01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.550 align:start position:0%
there'll be some some kind of
compensation

01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh available i mean is that is that the
 
01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:22.950 align:start position:0%
uh available i mean is that is that the
rationale

01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
rationale
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't want to speak to that element
 
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
i would put that to the fish and game
 
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
department on exactly where
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
this section originated some time ago
 
01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
um i don't believe that's the intent
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
here but
 
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
i guess to give one example if you have
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
a bird feeder in your backyard that is
 
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
damaged by a bear
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
right now you can petition the state to
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
have the state pay for your damaged
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
bird feeder under this idea
 
01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
only someone that is you know growing
 
01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
crops for an agricultural use
 
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
or something along those lines would be
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive compensation so
 
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
trying to take away some of those and
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
i'll admit i didn't know the state did
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
this either prior to our conversations
 
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
with fish and game
 
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
um i think the state owes me some money
 
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
for some bird feeders in my backyard
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
over time but nonetheless just
 
01:15:15.189 --> 01:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
clarifying that if you're a commercial
 
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
or industrial entity that suffers damage
 
01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
there is a process that you can bring
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
acclaim to the state
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
but not for some of these uh other
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
instances and
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah i guess i would leave that there
 
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
okay well i guess i mean that that is at
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
least somewhat clarifying to me i
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
at least i mean i i frankly you know
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
i on the overall policy issue i guess i
 
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
kind of wonder if this
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
is a good idea at all but i understand
 
01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
that's you know maybe
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
it's been in law for quite a while i
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
mean just as an example i you know
 
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
maybe it would make more sense to devote
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
this kind of money
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
to the to the uh the fish uh biologists
 
01:15:58.159 --> 01:15:58.470 align:start position:0%
to the to the uh the fish uh biologists
that

01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:00.149 --> 01:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh that we've basically said we're not
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
gonna we're not gonna
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know we're not there's not enough
 
01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
money or something for that
 
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
um but but i suppose uh
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
i guess given that it's already been in
 
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
law for a long time and this seems to be
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
at least
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
reducing the scope of the people who are
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
entitled to collect
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
um i i guess i i could i can go along
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
with it but
 
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh it i'm still not sure that it's a
 
01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:28.550 align:start position:0%
uh it i'm still not sure that it's a
very

01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
it this is a the most worthwhile usage
 
01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:31.830 align:start position:0%
it this is a the most worthwhile usage
of

01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:16:34.149 --> 01:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
of funds even if it is coming from the
 
01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
fish and game fund
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
okay uh it appears that bears
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
are high on the list of things that we
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
want to argue about
 
01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
so i think we've spent enough time on
 
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
bears today
 
01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
so mickey would you please
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
contact the fish and game
 
01:16:59.110 --> 01:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner i guess he's not called
 
01:16:59.910 --> 01:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
a commissioner
 
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
would you call contact the fish and game
 
01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:03.990 align:start position:0%
would you call contact the fish and game
person

01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
and ask him to uh
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
come and uh and talk to us
 
01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
about this these particular sections of
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh of hb2
 
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
many of you may or may not remember when
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
fish and game was in i said oh
 
01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to have lots of problems
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
with bears
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
so if you would do that and
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
um i uh
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
i guess we could um
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
anyhow figure out a figure out the best
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
time for him and for us
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
and then um we will uh
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
we will not discuss any more bears today
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
if that's okay so
 
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay is uh representative as long as
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
oh i wanted to speak more about bears
 
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
and more particularly
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
mountain lions i'm very upset that they
 
01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
rsa okay
 
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
well fish and game says they're no
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
mountain lions
 
01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
just in case no no mountain lions in new
 
01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:21.510 align:start position:0%
just in case no no mountain lions in new
hampshire

01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
okay so one
 
01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
last thing and then um i want to switch
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
to talking
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
about the um commission
 
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
on uh i'll call it lorry list which of
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
course is not
 
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
but and that is uh
 
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
section 134 which
 
01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
is um the repeal of
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh not the state not taking care of
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh the two roads in uh
 
01:18:58.630 --> 01:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
in sandwich and thornton
 
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh i think that
 
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
um bill cass indicated
 
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
that um he had uh
 
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
talked to the selectmen
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
of these towns and there didn't seem to
 
01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:16.790 align:start position:0%
of these towns and there didn't seem to
be

01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any problems with
 
01:19:31.590 --> 01:19:31.600 align:start position:0%

and the one that we walked through
before

01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%

new document tomorrow
 
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:15.760 align:start position:0%

01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
work that we got done today so yeah
 
01:22:20.709 --> 01:22:20.719 align:start position:0%

thank you for keeping a running
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
list like this it really is helpful in
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
our deliberation
 
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
well thank you that's for sure
 
01:22:37.189 --> 01:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
and i understand it's a little tricky
 
01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
with multiple pdfs and not everyone has
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know six monitors to keep everything
 
01:22:43.510 --> 01:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
up on and uh
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
daily mailings to get to you is a little
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
tricky you know but we're doing our best
 
01:22:47.199 --> 01:22:47.669 align:start position:0%
tricky you know but we're doing our best
and

01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%

01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:52.639 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you what it is certainly
 
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
useful for me
 
01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
and i think it helps us all to uh
 
01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
stay a little bit organized absolutely
 
01:23:04.149 --> 01:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
you know instead of wandering all over
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
the place
 
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560 align:start position:0%

01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
and you're all set with the screen share
 
01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
you said representative
 
01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
yeah no we don't we don't need that
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
1 45
 
01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:32.470 align:start position:0%
 
63.

01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
okay and the issue that
 
01:24:35.679 --> 01:24:39.110 align:start position:0%
okay and the issue that
um

01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
the question is is there anyone
 
01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:00.639 align:start position:0%
that is opposed to
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
don't all speak at once
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:20.629 --> 01:25:20.639 align:start position:0%
okay when you ask for a little context
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
if you remember
 
01:25:24.149 --> 01:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
this is part of that law enforcement
 
01:25:24.159 --> 01:25:25.270 align:start position:0%
this is part of that law enforcement
study

01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
that was done and
 
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
if i remember correctly they indicated
 
01:25:35.669 --> 01:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
that um this particular
 
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
area that there was not
 
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
they still had some work to do and so in
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
order to do the work
 
01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
they wanted to establish uh
 
01:25:50.629 --> 01:25:50.639 align:start position:0%
this commission to um
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair um i got a
 
01:26:02.229 --> 01:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
concern about uh the attorney general
 
01:26:04.629 --> 01:26:04.639 align:start position:0%
making the four appointments
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
the extras and um
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
the having the police stands in training
 
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
one of those
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh of of those four uh necessary
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
versus uh the committee making the
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
decision of who the
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:33.430 --> 01:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
can i get clarification on this is in
 
01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
148 the half a million dollars
 
01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
because we have the study commission
 
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
being formed
 
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
the study commission is going to study
 
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
whether there should be a commission or
 
01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
how this commission should look
 
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
on the um
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
the complaints of misconduct and can we
 
01:26:53.110 --> 01:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
just get uh
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
refresh me about is that half a million
 
01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:56.390 align:start position:0%
refresh me about is that half a million
dollars

01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
is that for the study commission and in
 
01:26:59.669 --> 01:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
which case why do they need that or is
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
that for the commission that's actually
 
01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
going to do the work that deals with a
 
01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:04.950 align:start position:0%
going to do the work that deals with a
misconduct

01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
misconduct
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh yes represent murray
 
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
this money was put in
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
for 23
 
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
to actually pay for
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
i don't myself
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that we should
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
attempt to
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
define the number of people
 
01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh because if it's there and it says
 
01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
the commission needs five guess what the
 
01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
commission will do
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
they'll make it so they need five people
 
01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:04.470 align:start position:0%
they'll make it so they need five people
um

01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:08.229 --> 01:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
myself on this um
 
01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
i would recommend that we um
 
01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
put like a hundred thousand dollars in
 
01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:17.430 align:start position:0%
put like a hundred thousand dollars in
hb2

01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
eliminate the 500 000 whatever it was
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
in hb1 and this would
 
01:28:29.110 --> 01:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
allow them to do whatever they need to
 
01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:29.830 align:start position:0%
allow them to do whatever they need to
do

01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:28:33.189 --> 01:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
plus if you know if they need
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
whatever their need is that they could
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
then come to fiscal
 
01:28:40.629 --> 01:28:40.639 align:start position:0%
and ask for the money at that time
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
that would be that would be my
 
01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:43.750 align:start position:0%
that would be that would be my
recommendation

01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know whether a hundred
 
01:28:47.110 --> 01:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars is the right number or
 
01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:47.990 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars is the right number or
not

01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
but a hundred thousand i think comes
 
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
close to um
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
what we would pay a clerk if that's
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know but that's that's
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
sort of where
 
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know what i'm thinking follow-up
 
01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely so i'm clear so now i
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
i think i agree but i still want to make
 
01:29:12.719 --> 01:29:13.189 align:start position:0%
i think i agree but i still want to make
sure

01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
this money is for the study commission
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
not the commission that's going to deal
 
01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
with a misconduct
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
it's to establish to consider how that
 
01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
acting committee on the misconduct will
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
be what it will look like
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
so it's for the study commission yeah
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
what we would do
 
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
is put it in hb2
 
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
under the study commission and allow it
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
to stay there
 
01:29:43.510 --> 01:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
for two years so if the study commission
 
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
needed it
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
fine if they didn't then
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
then whatever they come to grips with
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
an organization then it could be applied
 
01:30:03.669 --> 01:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
towards the organization
 
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay i think i got it thank you all
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
right representative lin
 
01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i i think what you propose makes
 
01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
sense i guess the
 
01:30:15.669 --> 01:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
the only uh this is really a follow-up
 
01:30:17.110 --> 01:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
to representative the issue that
 
01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative petrie raised
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
about we talked about this the other day
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
that the four
 
01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
other members of the of the commission
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't sort of say how they're
 
01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:29.110 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't sort of say how they're
appointed

01:30:29.110 --> 01:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
and i i think we might have asked a
 
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
question of mr mayo about that and he
 
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
was gonna
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
so maybe he has a he has some further
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that but my
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
if he does that's great my thought was
 
01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
either let's have the governor make that
 
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
appointment or let's have the attorney
 
01:30:47.350 --> 01:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:48.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lin for the
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
question and that those are the two
 
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
most logical for us one would be the
 
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
governor the other alternative would be
 
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
the chair of the we act commission
 
01:30:58.709 --> 01:30:58.719 align:start position:0%
who could make those appointments and
 
01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
the chair of that commission
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
is the attorney general so i think those
 
01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
are the most
 
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
natural people that
 
01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
you could yeah okay so what
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
what if i understood what you just said
 
01:31:12.639 --> 01:31:14.830 align:start position:0%
what if i understood what you just said
matt

01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
matt
 
01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:17.030 align:start position:0%
matt
um

01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
the chair of the liac commission
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
would appoint the four additional
 
01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:24.709 align:start position:0%
would appoint the four additional
members

01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:32.719 align:start position:0%
i see your head nodding but i'm not
 
01:31:34.149 --> 01:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
hearing you i'm sorry i was that was
 
01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
that for me representative umberg i'm
 
01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:36.310 align:start position:0%
that for me representative umberg i'm
sorry

01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
yes so we would say
 
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh the chairman of the
 
01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
leak committee would appoint the four
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
additional members is that what i heard
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
you say
 
01:31:53.110 --> 01:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
you could certainly say that and just so
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
that the committee is aware
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
that we act was chaired by the attorney
 
01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:00.470 align:start position:0%
that we act was chaired by the attorney
general

01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
they are not meeting at this point but
 
01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
they still exist as a chartered
 
01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh by executive order okay so the
 
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
executive order is still
 
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
okay representative lynn did that answer
 
01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
your question
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i think it did you know my just my
 
01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
suggestion is that
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
um rather than i mean i understand that
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
technically the layout
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
leak commission is still in existence
 
01:32:38.950 --> 01:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
um but it sounds like it mostly has
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
completed its work
 
01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
so i wonder if it's just in the interest
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
of making things easier and avoiding
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
some question
 
01:32:47.189 --> 01:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
later on if it wouldn't make more sense
 
01:32:49.110 --> 01:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
to simply say
 
01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
in that section
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
105 d3 roman numeral 1
 
01:32:58.709 --> 01:32:58.719 align:start position:0%
d that four additional members from the
 
01:32:59.830 --> 01:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire commission
 
01:33:03.669 --> 01:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
on law enforcement accountability um
 
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh and then two two of these members
 
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
shall be law enforcement members and two
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
of these members shall not be law
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement members
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
and then to just add a sentence saying
 
01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
these four members shall be appointed by
 
01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
okay and to
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
to um representative petrie's
 
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
comment um i
 
01:33:35.189 --> 01:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
i personally agree that
 
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
um the police standards and training
 
01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:39.669 align:start position:0%
um the police standards and training
person

01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
should in fact be one of the
 
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
members of this committee and
 
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
um i say that
 
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
because they are they are
 
01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
right now the group that is
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
reviewing this stuff i mean that's
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding
 
01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
and i think that's what mr skipper said
 
01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
and he has a whole group of people that
 
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know what that committee's
 
01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:12.070 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know what that committee's
called

01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
called
 
01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:14.130 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:34:14.130 --> 01:34:15.990 align:start position:0%
so um
[Music]

01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
matt do you or steve have any comment on
 
01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:19.830 align:start position:0%
matt do you or steve have any comment on
that

01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
the only thing that i would say is
 
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
police standards
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
is only act so the current language
 
01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:26.390 align:start position:0%
is only act so the current language
would

01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
allow them to be appointed out of
 
01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
those four members the only thing i
 
01:34:32.790 --> 01:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
would say
 
01:34:34.629 --> 01:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
is if the committee does start to
 
01:34:34.639 --> 01:34:35.990 align:start position:0%
is if the committee does start to
identify

01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
identify
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
a specific agency such as police
 
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
standards that department of safety
 
01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
it would make sense to also delineate
 
01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.709 align:start position:0%
it would make sense to also delineate
them

01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
but again in both instances those two
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
agencies are already captured by those
 
01:34:49.199 --> 01:34:51.430 align:start position:0%
agencies are already captured by those
four

01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
right but if the attorney general chose
 
01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
not to
 
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
put someone on there so what you're
 
01:35:03.669 --> 01:35:03.679 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is that we could say
 
01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh we could do d that says
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
um or well we could do it in four four
 
01:35:14.229 --> 01:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
additional members
 
01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
including a person from safety and a
 
01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:17.990 align:start position:0%
including a person from safety and a
person

01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:35:21.669 --> 01:35:21.679 align:start position:0%
from the police standards and training
 
01:35:24.790 --> 01:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
and then to
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
law enforcement members the only other
 
01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation i would have would maybe
 
01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
be to add or essentially
 
01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
give each give safety and police
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
standards their own
 
01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
line and then maybe either reduce that
 
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
from four to two
 
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
in d uh or or maybe even just increase
 
01:35:47.109 --> 01:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
the scope of this commission by two but
 
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
um those two agencies i would call out
 
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
in their own letter
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
okay okay let's see representative heath
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
excuse me did you have anything to say
 
01:35:58.639 --> 01:36:00.629 align:start position:0%
excuse me did you have anything to say
steve

01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
steve
 
01:36:03.910 --> 01:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh no i agree with um with matt's
 
01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:05.270 align:start position:0%
uh no i agree with um with matt's
recommendation

01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
okay all right representative heath i
 
01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
believe you were next
 
01:36:11.109 --> 01:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
for um
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
the issue over the police standards i
 
01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
think that's critically important to
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
have them
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
um as part of this i just i'm not sure
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
and i also agree on reducing the amount
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
of funding i i don't i think 500 000 is
 
01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
way too much for this
 
01:36:30.629 --> 01:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
um my my question
 
01:36:34.390 --> 01:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
is about the commission
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
they will do their work they'll come out
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
with their recommendations
 
01:36:42.550 --> 01:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
and to whom will these recommendations
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
go and well will they go to police
 
01:36:46.239 --> 01:36:46.950 align:start position:0%
go and well will they go to police
standards

01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
and will police standards be the
 
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
responsible entity
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
for training officers across the state
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
or uh combining just making sure
 
01:36:59.590 --> 01:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
everybody is fully aware
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
of what this process is um
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
and is there a need for any
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
additional funds for uh communication
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
of what the work that the commission has
 
01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:13.030 align:start position:0%
of what the work that the commission has
done

01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
or is that something madam chair that
 
01:37:18.149 --> 01:37:18.159 align:start position:0%
you said that they could come to fiscal
 
01:37:18.159 --> 01:37:19.669 align:start position:0%
you said that they could come to fiscal
for

01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:19.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
so if that's a whole string of questions
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
right right i'm happy to answer those
 
01:37:28.229 --> 01:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
and maybe take this back up to 40 000
 
01:37:28.239 --> 01:37:28.709 align:start position:0%
and maybe take this back up to 40 000
feet

01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
feet
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
so this commission would only exist for
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
sev for three months if you will they're
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
going to bring legislation
 
01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
to the legislature that would recommend
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
the creation of a new state agency
 
01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
which is where the 500 000 in the second
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
year comes from
 
01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
so no it would not be currently
 
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
envisioned to be at police standards and
 
01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:52.390 align:start position:0%
envisioned to be at police standards and
training

01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
this is in theory a new state agency
 
01:37:58.470 --> 01:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
that this commission would formalize
 
01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
through a recommendation to you
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
the legislature would then vote to
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
authorize that
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
and that's how he put aside the 500 000
 
01:38:08.709 --> 01:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
in year two
 
01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
just want to and then the commission
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
goes away
 
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
right they're repealed on november 2nd
 
01:38:15.910 --> 01:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
of this year
 
01:38:18.149 --> 01:38:18.159 align:start position:0%
so but again this is a new state agency
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
is the
 
01:38:21.669 --> 01:38:21.679 align:start position:0%
in theory the final work product of this
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:28.629 --> 01:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up representative
 
01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
so what happens to police standards
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
nothing they nothing happens to police
 
01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:35.109 align:start position:0%
nothing they nothing happens to police
standards

01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
all right okay but yes um
 
01:38:41.189 --> 01:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
i would assume that part of
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
their uh normal training program
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
that this would be an you know something
 
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:38:52.390 --> 01:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh that was discussed okay
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh let's see represent turcotte were you
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
next or was it representative porter
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent turquoise okay thank
 
01:39:03.109 --> 01:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
you all right just just to be clear this
 
01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
is the way i read it
 
01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to establish a uh commission
 
01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
as delineated in 105 d3a
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
that commission is going to run from or
 
01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
till november first
 
01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
and november 2nd that commission
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
will be repealed
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
it will no longer exist and then
 
01:39:31.510 --> 01:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
in 148 it's saying that we're going to
 
01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:31.990 align:start position:0%
in 148 it's saying that we're going to
uh

01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:36.310 --> 01:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate 517 250
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
and that would be for the commission
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
delineated in 105 d3a
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
so the way i'm reading it is that money
 
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
is for a period of only up to november
 
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
2nd am i correct representative turcotte
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
what i would point to
 
01:39:59.830 --> 01:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
is line 8 on page 65
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
the appropriation is for the purpose of
 
01:40:02.639 --> 01:40:03.830 align:start position:0%
the appropriation is for the purpose of
establishing

01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
establishing
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
this new statewide entity and it's in
 
01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
23. so the money does not come into play
 
01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
until the commission has issued its
 
01:40:14.719 --> 01:40:15.669 align:start position:0%
until the commission has issued its
report

01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:40:17.270 --> 01:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature has considered
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
legislation next year
 
01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
if the legislature votes to establish
 
01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
this entity
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
this appropriation would be the
 
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
operational costs
 
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
and on line eight the single neutral
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
independent statewide entity
 
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
is where this appropriation is for in
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
i do understand what you're saying i
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
just so you know i don't read it that
 
01:40:49.679 --> 01:40:50.149 align:start position:0%
just so you know i don't read it that
way

01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
it's uh i think it could be certainly
 
01:40:56.229 --> 01:40:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:58.149 --> 01:40:58.159 align:start position:0%
that's one of that's one of the reasons
 
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative why i'm
 
01:41:04.229 --> 01:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
recommending the reduction okay
 
01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative porter thank you madam
 
01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
chair just a couple of things
 
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
um back we're going i'm looking back on
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
line 23 on page 64
 
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
where we're talking about the four
 
01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
additional members of this
 
01:41:21.590 --> 01:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
commission two of them are members from
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
and two of them are members of the
 
01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
public that are not part of law
 
01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:28.229 align:start position:0%
public that are not part of law
enforcement

01:41:28.229 --> 01:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
so just so that we know if we if we
 
01:41:34.629 --> 01:41:34.639 align:start position:0%
set separate lines up one for the um
 
01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
police standards and one for was it the
 
01:41:39.189 --> 01:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
other one department of safety
 
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
that was the other one then we are
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
eliminate then
 
01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
then what would be left would just be
 
01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
two members
 
01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
that are not um law enforcement
 
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
okay so that's that's the first question
 
01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
or clarification that i wanted to make
 
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
or we could or we could enlarge the
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
commission by two people
 
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and then okay then i'm
 
01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
confused i guess because on
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
page 65 at the top line one
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
section 147 is talking about a million
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
dollars for cameras
 
01:42:14.229 --> 01:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
and then we're skipping down to line
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
five 148
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
is talking about the commission again to
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
receive the complaints
 
01:42:23.189 --> 01:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
nikki is uh in the process of
 
01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
trying to clean up this area
 
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
okay so that we have body cameras with
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
body cameras
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
and we have commission with commission
 
01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
so can i have one more question and then
 
01:42:40.390 --> 01:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
i'll exactly is that correct mickey
 
01:42:42.629 --> 01:42:42.639 align:start position:0%
yeah these uh these subjects kind of got
 
01:42:42.639 --> 01:42:43.510 align:start position:0%
yeah these uh these subjects kind of got
entangled

01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
entangled
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
and built through as it was introduced
 
01:42:47.590 --> 01:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
so we will untangle them and have
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
separate amendments
 
01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh for the division thank you and then
 
01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
just one more
 
01:42:55.830 --> 01:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
thing please go ahead so and i think i'm
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
understanding now
 
01:43:01.590 --> 01:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
that the figure of 517 250 dollars
 
01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
is in there to fund the new state agency
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
which would be
 
01:43:10.470 --> 01:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh the complaint agency and what you are
 
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
you have recommended representative
 
01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
umberger is reducing that figure
 
01:43:18.310 --> 01:43:18.320 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay thank you very much
 
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
representative heath you have your hand
 
01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.510 align:start position:0%
representative heath you have your hand
up

01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
yes i'm sorry madam chair um i want
 
01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
clarification about this new agency am i
 
01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:29.430 align:start position:0%
clarification about this new agency am i
correct

01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
in assuming this will be an agency
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
like the child advocates agency
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
that operates separately without
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
um beholden to anybody else because
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's totally objective am i right in my
 
01:43:50.070 --> 01:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
thinking well i believe i know matt was
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
shaking his head
 
01:43:53.590 --> 01:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
i believe that that is the current
 
01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:55.189 align:start position:0%
i believe that that is the current
concept

01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
concept
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
okay now whether or not that becomes the
 
01:43:58.320 --> 01:43:59.590 align:start position:0%
okay now whether or not that becomes the
reality

01:43:59.590 --> 01:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
reality
 
01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
out of the study committee i think matt
 
01:44:05.189 --> 01:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
had made the comment that
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
there were you know some sticky
 
01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
wickets that the uh this commission
 
01:44:14.310 --> 01:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
still needed to work through
 
01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh but overall uh
 
01:44:20.709 --> 01:44:20.719 align:start position:0%
he thought that i'm putting words in his
 
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
mouth i hope you don't mind
 
01:44:26.070 --> 01:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh but overall um
 
01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
they are leaning towards a
 
01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
separate entity like the child advocate
 
01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:33.510 align:start position:0%
separate entity like the child advocate
or

01:44:33.510 --> 01:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
um whatever else
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
is that correct matt that is and i just
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
want to clarify i think that was matthew
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
broadhead from doj
 
01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
that referred to those things um but
 
01:44:46.229 --> 01:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
nonetheless the
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments or
 
01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
questions that we have on this uh
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
mickey are you clear enough
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
to what it appears that we can agree to
 
01:45:11.590 --> 01:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
to move forward with
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
yes i believe so it should be good to go
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
to turn something around
 
01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
for another work session okay okay
 
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
so that um and uh
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
so if that's if that's the case um we
 
01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:35.430 align:start position:0%
so if that's if that's the case um we
will

01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:45:37.590 --> 01:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
i love just giving mickey all this work
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
and i apologize
 
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
but um it's it's something that we need
 
01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
to be uh
 
01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i want to remind
 
01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:51.109 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i want to remind
people

01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:45:54.149 --> 01:45:54.159 align:start position:0%
is if you have amendments
 
01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
that you want to put forward
 
01:46:00.330 --> 01:46:00.340 align:start position:0%
we need to get those um
 
01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:01.669 align:start position:0%
we need to get those um
[Music]

01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
we've got some um some challenges with
 
01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:07.270 align:start position:0%
we've got some um some challenges with
time

01:46:07.270 --> 01:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
and having the full committee here in
 
01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:11.109 align:start position:0%
and having the full committee here in
that

01:46:11.109 --> 01:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:14.629 --> 01:46:14.639 align:start position:0%
um representative petrie is not going to
 
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
be here
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and representative heath is not
 
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
going to be here on monday
 
01:46:25.590 --> 01:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
so i don't want to put ourselves in a
 
01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:27.109 align:start position:0%
so i don't want to put ourselves in a
position

01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
where we are taking votes on either of
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
those two days
 
01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
because i i just i don't you know
 
01:46:38.229 --> 01:46:38.239 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's uh it's appropriate
 
01:46:39.510 --> 01:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
and fair
 
01:46:44.390 --> 01:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
that we don't have the full committee to
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
so that's why i have
 
01:46:56.229 --> 01:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
we have scheduled uh some more
 
01:46:56.239 --> 01:46:57.189 align:start position:0%
we have scheduled uh some more
conversation

01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
on the uh university system and the
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
community college system
 
01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
tomorrow uh just to try to iron out
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
whatever still needs to be ironed out
 
01:47:11.199 --> 01:47:12.229 align:start position:0%
whatever still needs to be ironed out
there

01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
um and so that we can
 
01:47:19.109 --> 01:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
we can make a decision i did
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
invite shannon and uh kathy provencher
 
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
to come and listen in uh
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
i really feel that this will be
 
01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:29.830 align:start position:0%
i really feel that this will be
primarily

01:47:29.830 --> 01:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
primarily
 
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
but i think uh matt was invited as well
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
but i i think that we are you know
 
01:47:39.750 --> 01:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
we need to coalesce around something
 
01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh even if our coalescence is we
 
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
agree to disagree okay but that's
 
01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
that's where we need to uh where we need
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
to get to
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:02.550 --> 01:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
so that will be that will be on uh
 
01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:05.990 align:start position:0%
so that will be that will be on uh
tomorrow

01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
01:48:08.229 --> 01:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
and i expect that that will not be a
 
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
short discussion
 
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:14.080 align:start position:0%

that i didn't want to cut off
 
01:48:53.189 --> 01:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
okay no i just the only thing i just
 
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
want to make sure
 
01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
that if people have uh amendments out
 
01:48:57.520 --> 01:48:58.229 align:start position:0%
that if people have uh amendments out
there

there
 
01:49:01.510 --> 01:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
that we get them so we can look at them
 
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
and uh and figure out you know
 
01:49:08.629 --> 01:49:08.639 align:start position:0%
whatever that we can do so anyhow i was
 
01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
just going to say
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
on monday if we can i would like
 
01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
to have doe
 
01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
in to talk about
 
01:49:24.229 --> 01:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
what is currently
 
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
in our formula and what is
 
01:49:31.270 --> 01:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
not compared to two years ago
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
okay and um because i'm you know i
 
01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:35.109 align:start position:0%
okay and um because i'm you know i
wasn't

01:49:35.109 --> 01:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
i wasn't there two years ago and
 
01:49:42.629 --> 01:49:42.639 align:start position:0%
um most of us on the committee were not
 
01:49:46.229 --> 01:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
so um i just think we need to
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
clarify all of that and um
 
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:57.990 --> 01:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
see what we what's there so
 
01:49:59.900 --> 01:49:59.910 align:start position:0%
and i am uh
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:50:01.189 align:start position:0%
and i am uh

01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:08.229 --> 01:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
the what's it called
 
01:50:12.390 --> 01:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
109 billion act um that just passed i'm
 
01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
sorry i don't recall what it was
 
01:50:18.149 --> 01:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
what it was dubbed but um
 
01:50:22.830 --> 01:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
but there are as i understand it
 
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
um funds
 
01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
for education in there that may have
 
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
um some impact on
 
01:50:34.950 --> 01:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
what we do so okay
 
01:50:38.149 --> 01:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
mr mason we have had
 
01:50:45.669 --> 01:50:45.679 align:start position:0%
all kinds of questions about
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
through 113. on
 
01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
on bears and um
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
i can't believe steve is still on the
 
01:50:59.040 --> 01:50:59.910 align:start position:0%
i can't believe steve is still on the
line

01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:51:01.750 --> 01:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
listening to the bears he must have some
 
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
in his backyard
 
01:51:09.189 --> 01:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
the questions are here and so if we
 
01:51:18.239 --> 01:51:18.709 align:start position:0%
the questions are here and so if we
could

01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:51:22.470 --> 01:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
i will um maybe
 
01:51:25.589 --> 01:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
maybe what we ought to do is have you
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
tell us why you asked
 
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
for this particular
 
01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
these particular sections to go
 
01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
um currently right now
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
um i believe new hampshire is one of 13
 
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
states that pays for bear damage to
 
01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:47.030 align:start position:0%
states that pays for bear damage to
growing

01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
growing
 
01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:49.180 align:start position:0%
growing
crops

01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:49.190 align:start position:0%
crops
 
01:51:49.190 --> 01:51:50.390 align:start position:0%
crops
[Music]

01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:51:52.629 --> 01:51:52.639 align:start position:0%
we've as our bear population is
 
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
increasing we are seeing more
 
01:51:58.070 --> 01:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
um non-commercial farmers
 
01:52:01.109 --> 01:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
ask for bear because of the
 
01:52:04.229 --> 01:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
way law is written is to ask for bear
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
damage payments
 
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh what this what this will do is it
 
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
will limit it to
 
01:52:12.229 --> 01:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
folks that are commercially growing
 
01:52:14.070 --> 01:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
crops in the state of new hampshire
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
trying to sell crops instead of just for
 
01:52:17.910 --> 01:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
their own use
 
01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:20.639 align:start position:0%
um and that's what some of the targets
 
01:52:23.589 --> 01:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
are it also sets up some
 
01:52:26.709 --> 01:52:26.719 align:start position:0%
parameters such that they have to
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
allow one of our fundamental best ways
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
to control their damage is to allow
 
01:52:33.669 --> 01:52:33.679 align:start position:0%
hunting on your property
 
01:52:35.350 --> 01:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
so that becomes one of the issues before
 
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
the state would would issue you
 
01:52:39.669 --> 01:52:39.679 align:start position:0%
a bear damage payment you'd have to
 
01:52:42.070 --> 01:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
allow hunting on your property
 
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
the next step is uh we have some
 
01:52:46.229 --> 01:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
mitigation practices that we
 
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
try to get farmers to um if possible to
 
01:52:51.589 --> 01:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
try to use
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
bears respond bears do not like electric
 
01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:56.070 align:start position:0%
bears respond bears do not like electric
fence

01:52:56.070 --> 01:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
fence
 
01:52:59.430 --> 01:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
and you can if you are uh if you
 
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
create a quality electric fence you can
 
01:53:04.229 --> 01:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
usually keep bears out of certain areas
 
01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
i have the unique um experience that
 
01:53:10.709 --> 01:53:10.719 align:start position:0%
uh having farmed for uh 25 years in
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
colus county
 
01:53:13.109 --> 01:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
i've been dealing with bears
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
commercially for over 25 years and
 
01:53:16.629 --> 01:53:16.639 align:start position:0%
trying to keep them out of growing crops
 
01:53:16.639 --> 01:53:18.310 align:start position:0%
trying to keep them out of growing crops
so

01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
i have i have experience that i have
 
01:53:22.470 --> 01:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
experience on both sides of the bear
 
01:53:26.310 --> 01:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
fence issue
 
01:53:28.229 --> 01:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative petry you have a
 
01:53:28.239 --> 01:53:29.589 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative petry you have a
question

01:53:29.589 --> 01:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr uh madam chair uh it's
 
01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
a clarification uh now
 
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
if a bear does a home in a hungry bear
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
does a
 
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
well let me ask you mean for damage or
 
01:53:46.149 --> 01:53:46.159 align:start position:0%
for the ability
 
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
of the property owner to defend
 
01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:49.189 align:start position:0%
of the property owner to defend
themselves

01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
that would be damage uh everybody has a
 
01:53:53.350 --> 01:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
right to defend themselves i believe
 
01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:54.229 align:start position:0%
right to defend themselves i believe
correct

01:53:54.229 --> 01:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh so no we do the the state does not
 
01:53:56.880 --> 01:53:57.430 align:start position:0%
uh so no we do the the state does not
cover

01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
cover
 
01:53:59.910 --> 01:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
damage only to growing crops right
 
01:54:01.510 --> 01:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
that's correct yes
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
mark ellingwood with me here in the
 
01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:09.109 align:start position:0%
mark ellingwood with me here in the
office

01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:54:15.750 --> 01:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:17.189 --> 01:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
and i believe kathy's on a phone
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
someplace too if we have financial
 
01:54:19.679 --> 01:54:20.950 align:start position:0%
someplace too if we have financial
questions

01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
if i um representative may i speak
 
01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:25.679 align:start position:0%
briefly to put a little
 
01:54:33.109 --> 01:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:35.109 --> 01:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
so i just mentioned that the laws in
 
01:54:36.229 --> 01:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
question were established
 
01:54:39.589 --> 01:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
in the late 1890s presumably to protect
 
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
a very scarce beer resource at the time
 
01:54:44.950 --> 01:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
we've continued to work very closely
 
01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
using technical services and monetary
 
01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:48.470 align:start position:0%
using technical services and monetary
payment

01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
payment
 
01:54:51.589 --> 01:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
with a particular focus on agriculture
 
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
in recent decades there's been a
 
01:54:55.750 --> 01:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
significant proliferation of
 
01:54:59.589 --> 01:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
interest in filing for claims by
 
01:55:02.310 --> 01:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
the general public often involved in
 
01:55:04.390 --> 01:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
hobby activities
 
01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
i think a primary thrust of this change
 
01:55:09.990 --> 01:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
would be to help near our focus so we
 
01:55:10.629 --> 01:55:10.639 align:start position:0%
can work
 
01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
with the people who we believe have the
 
01:55:14.790 --> 01:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
greatest need
 
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
and are generally employing the best
 
01:55:20.709 --> 01:55:20.719 align:start position:0%
practices to prevent bear damage
 
01:55:23.589 --> 01:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
so that that in a nutshell i think helps
 
01:55:24.790 --> 01:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
you to understand
 
01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
why we're advocating for this as it
 
01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:28.470 align:start position:0%
why we're advocating for this as it
exists

01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
exists
 
01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
laws would allow anybody with
 
01:55:33.830 --> 01:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
any of the protected commodities those
 
01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:34.709 align:start position:0%
any of the protected commodities those
being

01:55:34.709 --> 01:55:34.719 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:55:39.030 --> 01:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
crops bees livestock
 
01:55:41.669 --> 01:55:41.679 align:start position:0%
there's a couple more help me out dan
 
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
but in any case it's a small number of
 
01:55:47.189 --> 01:55:47.199 align:start position:0%
items that qualify and yet
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
people uh may or may not be exercising
 
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate stewardship
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
and at the same time have the privilege
 
01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
through existing law established 120
 
01:55:58.870 --> 01:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:56:01.030 --> 01:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
to file for damage against the state so
 
01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
we thought it was time to tighten that
 
01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
up a bit
 
01:56:06.310 --> 01:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
and focus on our primary constituency
 
01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:06.870 align:start position:0%
and focus on our primary constituency
here

01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
in terms of damage that being the
 
01:56:10.629 --> 01:56:10.639 align:start position:0%
commercial agriculture
 
01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative porter you
 
01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
had a question
 
01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
no i think my question was answered
 
01:56:18.629 --> 01:56:18.639 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'll put my hand
 
01:56:18.639 --> 01:56:19.830 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'll put my hand
down

01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:56:21.990 --> 01:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative lynn i
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
believe you are next
 
01:56:27.510 --> 01:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so i i i guess i'm
 
01:56:30.070 --> 01:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
i mean i i guess i'm prepared to support
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
this because it
 
01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
it is narrowing this the category of
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
people who get paid but
 
01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
i get i'm it sounds like when this was
 
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
when this program was
 
01:56:42.550 --> 01:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
originally established 120 years ago the
 
01:56:44.629 --> 01:56:44.639 align:start position:0%
idea was to protect the bears because
 
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
there weren't very many of them and we
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to we wanted to save them
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
but now the idea if i'm understanding
 
01:56:51.510 --> 01:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
correctly is there are too many bears
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
and so we want to have them hunted in
 
01:56:55.189 --> 01:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
fact in order to get this money
 
01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
you have to agree to allow hunting on
 
01:56:57.760 --> 01:56:58.229 align:start position:0%
you have to agree to allow hunting on
your

01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
on your property so i guess my question
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
is wouldn't it
 
01:57:04.070 --> 01:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
if you to the extent that you're paying
 
01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:05.109 align:start position:0%
if you to the extent that you're paying
anything

01:57:05.109 --> 01:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that that's that
 
01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
that is um
 
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
is sort of undercutting the idea of of
 
01:57:16.709 --> 01:57:16.719 align:start position:0%
uh of of uh encouraging the bears to be
 
01:57:17.990 --> 01:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
taken because
 
01:57:21.669 --> 01:57:21.679 align:start position:0%
the the uh the the idea would would seem
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
to be if i'm gonna get paid
 
01:57:25.030 --> 01:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
if i'm going to get paid for the crop
 
01:57:26.709 --> 01:57:26.719 align:start position:0%
damage i would be less
 
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
in less inclined to allow
 
01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh to to want to uh have the bears
 
01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh taken than if i wasn't getting paid
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
at all so i mean then then that would
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
seem to be to be even a greater
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
encouragement to allow hunting on your
 
01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:41.589 align:start position:0%
encouragement to allow hunting on your
property

01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:57:43.589 --> 01:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
if you're not going to get paid at all
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
so why not just
 
01:57:47.589 --> 01:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
stop the payments altogether yeah thank
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
i'll respond to that uh
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
we have more bears than we had we don't
 
01:57:57.030 --> 01:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
generally have too many bears although
 
01:57:58.950 --> 01:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
that's debatable depending on your
 
01:58:00.310 --> 01:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
sensitivity to
 
01:58:02.950 --> 01:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
the presence of bears um our experience
 
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
is that this is a helpful and i think
 
01:58:05.990 --> 01:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
legitimate interest
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire agriculture and so much
 
01:58:11.589 --> 01:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
as some of this damage cannot be avoided
 
01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
and in certain years particularly when
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
there's a scarcity of natural foods
 
01:58:18.550 --> 01:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
some farm interests are subject to
 
01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
significant impacts and uh
 
01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
in that context i just say we're content
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
with the balance
 
01:58:25.669 --> 01:58:25.679 align:start position:0%
our experience in working with
 
01:58:27.669 --> 01:58:27.679 align:start position:0%
agriculture is um
 
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
none of them are motivated by the the
 
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
payments we make the payments tend to be
 
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
very conservative we're paying wholesale
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
values in the field
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
it certainly would better serve the
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
interest of the farmer to have no damage
 
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
than to have the modest payments that we
 
01:58:46.709 --> 01:58:46.719 align:start position:0%
allocate so i think we've struck the
 
01:58:48.070 --> 01:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
right balance the
 
01:58:51.189 --> 01:58:51.199 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that uh the farm
 
01:58:53.030 --> 01:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
bureau is a close partner of ours
 
01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
somebody who we work very closely with
 
01:58:58.149 --> 01:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
and quite honestly we're not anxious to
 
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
to separate or lose the ability to help
 
01:59:02.229 --> 01:59:02.239 align:start position:0%
them where legitimate
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
needs exist so
 
01:59:07.270 --> 01:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
another point i would make to you just
 
01:59:09.270 --> 01:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
for your background is that these
 
01:59:13.270 --> 01:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
funds are paid losses are paid
 
01:59:15.910 --> 01:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
annually through fish fishing game but
 
01:59:17.109 --> 01:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
charged against
 
01:59:19.990 --> 01:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire general fund money so we
 
01:59:21.669 --> 01:59:21.679 align:start position:0%
are not
 
01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
losing that money from fish and game
 
01:59:26.550 --> 01:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
funds specifically rather the
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
bill as as directed by the statute
 
01:59:33.430 --> 01:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
actually is charged against available
 
01:59:36.070 --> 01:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
state revenues
 
01:59:37.589 --> 01:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much that was
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
very helpful i appreciate that thank you
 
01:59:42.070 --> 01:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you uh scott you
 
01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:42.629 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you uh scott you
said

01:59:42.629 --> 01:59:42.639 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:59:45.830 --> 01:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh kathy was on the line
 
01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
i i would just like i don't know if i
 
01:59:50.149 --> 01:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
don't know if mickey
 
01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
opened up a channel to her or not but
 
01:59:53.189 --> 01:59:53.199 align:start position:0%
she's in her office
 
01:59:56.229 --> 01:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
okay i just yeah i was just curious as
 
01:59:59.669 --> 01:59:59.679 align:start position:0%
to what that dollar figure was
 
02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:12.709 --> 02:00:12.719 align:start position:0%
so the totals over the years starting
 
02:00:15.750 --> 02:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
2011 um they let's
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
just go let's just go for you know the
 
02:00:18.239 --> 02:00:18.950 align:start position:0%
just go let's just go for you know the
last

02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
last
 
02:00:21.589 --> 02:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
four years we don't need to go back in
 
02:00:21.599 --> 02:00:22.470 align:start position:0%
four years we don't need to go back in
17

02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
17
 
02:00:26.070 --> 02:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh 10 742 dollars in
 
02:00:28.149 --> 02:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
eighteen eighty thousand seven hundred
 
02:00:30.550 --> 02:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
and sixty seven
 
02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
nineteen twenty three thousand two sixty
 
02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:33.830 align:start position:0%
nineteen twenty three thousand two sixty
three

02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
twenty fifty seven two thirteen
 
02:00:40.070 --> 02:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
so you see the cycle that tends to
 
02:00:42.229 --> 02:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
follow if and we break the we break
 
02:00:43.510 --> 02:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
these payments down by
 
02:00:46.870 --> 02:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
by commodity crop you know uh uh um
 
02:00:50.070 --> 02:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
forage corn um uh
 
02:00:53.430 --> 02:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
fruit livestock and and um honey damage
 
02:00:54.070 --> 02:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
and what you
 
02:00:56.070 --> 02:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
if you look at them what you really
 
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
start seeing when you look closely is
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
is the damage to field corn and that
 
02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:02.229 align:start position:0%
is the damage to field corn and that
follows

02:01:02.229 --> 02:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
follows
 
02:01:04.709 --> 02:01:04.719 align:start position:0%
the bear's natural feed so on a year
 
02:01:06.310 --> 02:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
where we're seeing a lot more damage in
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
the field corn
 
02:01:08.709 --> 02:01:08.719 align:start position:0%
it's because the bears don't have as
 
02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
much to eat out in the woods
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
and they've learned to you know come out
 
02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
of the woods and head into the
 
02:01:14.070 --> 02:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
cornfields and
 
02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:18.870 --> 02:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte you have a
 
02:01:22.709 --> 02:01:22.719 align:start position:0%
question thank you uh
 
02:01:25.830 --> 02:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
i answered one of my two questions
 
02:01:27.510 --> 02:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh on the dollar value the other
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
question is how many incidents or
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
of filings do you have annually
 
02:01:35.910 --> 02:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
i i can handle it if you'd like but yeah
 
02:01:37.510 --> 02:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
02:01:39.910 --> 02:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
it's quite small actually you're talking
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
about a dozen
 
02:01:43.669 --> 02:01:43.679 align:start position:0%
10 to 20 a year depending on the
 
02:01:43.679 --> 02:01:44.950 align:start position:0%
10 to 20 a year depending on the
commodity

02:01:44.950 --> 02:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
commodity
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
um most as the director indicated most
 
02:01:49.270 --> 02:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
those funds go
 
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
directly to uh to uh corn growers silage
 
02:01:55.030 --> 02:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
corn and sweet corn
 
02:01:58.310 --> 02:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
and uh the number in terms of
 
02:02:02.070 --> 02:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
non-commercial complaints uh they range
 
02:02:05.270 --> 02:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
on the order of a dozen to 20 a year
 
02:02:07.990 --> 02:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
and tend to be primarily backyard
 
02:02:09.669 --> 02:02:09.679 align:start position:0%
chicken growers and some
 
02:02:12.550 --> 02:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
beekeep bee hive keepers we get an
 
02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
occasional claim for the loss of a goat
 
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
or a pig
 
02:02:19.350 --> 02:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
from residential communities uh
 
02:02:21.589 --> 02:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
from bears as well but it's it's modest
 
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative petrie you have your
 
02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
you have a question yes i do i well it's
 
02:02:33.119 --> 02:02:33.430 align:start position:0%
you have a question yes i do i well it's
uh

02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:36.070 --> 02:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
yes uh wild boar in the western part of
 
02:02:37.589 --> 02:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
the state they caused quite a bit of
 
02:02:39.669 --> 02:02:39.679 align:start position:0%
damage that i've heard
 
02:02:41.350 --> 02:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
and why wouldn't a program like this
 
02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
cover the damage that they do
 
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
the liability for damage covered by wild
 
02:02:48.709 --> 02:02:48.719 align:start position:0%
boar which to our knowledge are
 
02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
exclusively from blue mountain forest
 
02:02:53.430 --> 02:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
fall to the forest and they readily
 
02:02:55.270 --> 02:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
cover that damage
 
02:02:58.709 --> 02:02:58.719 align:start position:0%
um the the narrow focus of the statutes
 
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
a reflection of the
 
02:03:01.830 --> 02:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
writers of that statute back in the
 
02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:03.109 align:start position:0%
writers of that statute back in the
1890s

02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
1890s
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
it has been changed periodically in
 
02:03:07.830 --> 02:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
subtle ways as i understand it since
 
02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:12.629 align:start position:0%
subtle ways as i understand it since
then

02:03:12.629 --> 02:03:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:16.390 --> 02:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up no i'm all set
 
02:03:17.830 --> 02:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh that's just the way the law is
 
02:03:18.870 --> 02:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
written and uh
 
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
