move out to pass on house bill
 
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
1073 with amendment
 
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.069 align:start position:0%
1073 with amendment
0689

00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
moved by representative wolper and
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative sylvia that
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
this be
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
recommended as ought to pass with an
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
amendment and would you like to address
 
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
your amendment
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
amendment 0689 simply adds a phrase
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
after the existing
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
attorney-client privilege or attorney
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
work product doctrine
 
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.509 align:start position:0%
work product doctrine
exemption

00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
in the right to know act that phrase is
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
consistent with the public's right to
 
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.750 align:start position:0%
consistent with the public's right to
know

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
this may be redundant
 
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
but considering the history of this bill
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
this exemption
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
which came about last spring
 
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
after the supreme court had issued
 
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
a decision
 
00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
regarding this exact question of
 
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's my concern that the courts will now
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
interpret this exemption without this
 
00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:10.630 align:start position:0%
interpret this exemption without this
qualification

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
qualification
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
as being a total exemption for anything
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
that an attorney does anything that
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
could be considered attorney work
 
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.430 align:start position:0%
could be considered attorney work
product

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
product
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
would be totally exempt from the
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
public's right to know
 
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.190 align:start position:0%
public's right to know
now

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be doing that
 
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
because a lot of what attorneys do for
 
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.150 align:start position:0%
because a lot of what attorneys do for
us

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
confidential in any great way in fact
 
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
they actually work for the public
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
but without this
 
00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:40.870 align:start position:0%
but without this
clarification

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
and considering the way the timing of
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
when this was introduced
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
i think this is a necessary
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
clarification and
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
if if i could
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
represent wolper just
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
to get it on the record
 
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.470 align:start position:0%
to get it on the record
the

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
basically the attorney-client privilege
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
and work product are still exemptions
 
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
from the right to know law
 
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.030 align:start position:0%
from the right to know law
but

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
with your amendment this would qualify
 
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.310 align:start position:0%
with your amendment this would qualify
that

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
so that a determination could be made as
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
to whether or not there was
 
00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:27.829 align:start position:0%
to whether or not there was
whether

00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
the materials that
 
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
were considered cl attorney client
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
privilege or work product
 
00:12:34.079 --> 00:12:35.350 align:start position:0%
privilege or work product
are

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:38.959 align:start position:0%
or should be made available because they
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
are otherwise consistent with
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
the right to know
 
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman it's my intent that the
 
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.750 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman it's my intent that the
court

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
recognized that we're within the right
 
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
to know act and that that public does
 
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
have a right to know and that
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
would modify
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
their application of the attorney client
 
00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
and i guess if i could just follow up so
 
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.550 align:start position:0%
and i guess if i could just follow up so
that

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
effectively that means
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
since i'm not sure exactly
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
how it would be interpreted ultimately
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
that would be interpreted by the court
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
as to what that
 
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.949 align:start position:0%
as to what that
means

00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0%
means
 
00:13:14.959 --> 00:13:19.269 align:start position:0%
means
yes

00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
representative macbeth
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you so i i respect the intent of
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
the bill it's concerning for me as a
 
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
practicing attorney because it's
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
critical that my clients can ask
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
questions and share information on a
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
broad spectrum of issues before i can

and
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
would you like to address your motion
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
well we were all at the hearing and
 
00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
talk about women's concern for health
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
and safety
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
yet there was disdain for the use of an
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
ultrasound which didn't make any sense
 
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
to me because perforation of the uterus
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
is a risk when a woman gets an abortion
 
00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
and we know from
 
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
that that's not safe and i used to
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
be a freelance writer freelance
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
journalist and i've interviewed many
 
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
many people
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
who prayed on the sidewalks and well
 
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
that's another bill but um
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
they they told me they had first-hand
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
accounts of seeing the ambulance come at
 
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.669 align:start position:0%
accounts of seeing the ambulance come at
night

00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
night
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
where they they take the women away at
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
night so where's the safety
 
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.789 align:start position:0%
night so where's the safety
um

00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
things still happen
 
00:18:56.559 --> 00:18:57.990 align:start position:0%
things still happen
um

00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
and the middle sponsor kept saying said
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
she wanted to be on the right side of
 
00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
history she said that more than once and
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
i just kept thinking about abraham
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
lincoln and and uh what he when he was
 
00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.029 align:start position:0%
lincoln and and uh what he when he was
asked

00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
asked
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
and god's on our side and he said oh my
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
sir my greatest concern is not whether
 
00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
god is on our side my greatest concern
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
is to be on god's side
 
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.710 align:start position:0%
is to be on god's side
and

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
i asked the uh
 
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.430 align:start position:0%
i asked the uh
abortionists

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
abortionists
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
how many late term abortions there i
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
think that's the other bill though
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
so i guess it was all said in the
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
hearing and you were all there so
 
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
okay other other
 
00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
other discussion
 
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:49.840 align:start position:0%

the new hampshire people have spoken
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
when they
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
their spiritual physical and emotional
 
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
health so um i'm sorry i won't be
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
joining you on that and i i urge others
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
other discussion
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yes representative wilper
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
mr chairman was right with respect to
 
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
the rights privacy was enacted in our
 
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.590 align:start position:0%
the rights privacy was enacted in our
constitution

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
right to privacy of personal information
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
and it said nothing about the right to
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
take the life of another person
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
so i don't believe that this at all
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
comports with that
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment and i don't
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
believe the right to kill babies belongs
 
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:16.549 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm slow to get off the
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
the starting line on this
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
this is an issue
 
00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
over which
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable caring people
 
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.590 align:start position:0%
reasonable caring people
differ

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
differ
 
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.950 align:start position:0%
differ
and

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
we come to this issue with very
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
different perspectives we come to this
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
and but i think it is incredibly
 
00:21:48.159 --> 00:21:49.430 align:start position:0%
and but i think it is incredibly
important

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
that we recognize
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
our obligation to
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
respect those differences and be careful
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
in what we say
 
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
we cannot assume
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
that we know
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
what others believe
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
we can listen and we can respect
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
one very obvious
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
issue here is that
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
i don't know anybody
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
who thinks um
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
abortions are absolutely terrific and we
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
ought to you know play tennis in the
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
morning and then go have an abortion
 
00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
i don't think that
 
00:22:39.679 --> 00:22:40.870 align:start position:0%
i don't think that
anybody

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
feels that way
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
i also do not believe
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
that anyone who believes
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
an abortion
 
00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:51.990 align:start position:0%
an abortion
in

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's before 16 weeks which is
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
all that planned parenthood the planter
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
would not perform an abortion after that
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
or 24 weeks
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
that we are
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
committing murder in each of those cases
 
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry mr chair
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's such a feminine issue that's why i
 
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
said that
 
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.470 align:start position:0%
said that
um

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
we are talking about
 
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
a fetus that can
 
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
not survive outside of the woman's body
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
it cannot survive outside of the woman's
 
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
body so that to
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
until it reaches a certain stage of
 
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
development and at that stage of
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
development there is no one
 
00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.990 align:start position:0%
development there is no one
under

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
all but the most extreme circumstances
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
who would agree to
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
to use words like murder
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
i think are effective if what you want
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
to do is to play to the audience i don't
 
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
think they're effective
 
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
if what you want to do is to deal with
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
the facts
 
00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
and recognizing that a fetus that cannot
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
survive outside of the woman
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
cannot be considered separate from the
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
woman and her life
 
00:24:25.279 --> 00:24:27.669 align:start position:0%
woman and her life
and

00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:30.559 align:start position:0%
i know in a bill that's coming up
 
00:24:30.559 --> 00:24:31.510 align:start position:0%
i know in a bill that's coming up
later

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.470 align:start position:0%
later
i

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
deliberately put an amendment language
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
that my very dear colleague the clerk of
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
um proposed about
 
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
24 weeks and i did that out of respect
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
for him
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
and his concerns and i just hope
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
that he in turn would respect the
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
commitment and the intentions
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
of those people who happen to see this
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
issue differently
 
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.070 align:start position:0%
issue differently
and

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
i hope i didn't go on too long but
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to recognize
 
00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.350 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to recognize
that

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
we are going to differ on this issue
 
00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.269 align:start position:0%
we are going to differ on this issue
and

00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
but we should be differing
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
trying to deal only with facts i'm not
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
for example going to ask the earlier
 
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
speaker to document
 
00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.310 align:start position:0%
speaker to document
where

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
transportation has come in the middle of
 
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
the night to take away bodies i happen
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
to think there's probably no
 
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
justification for that
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
maybe there is i'm not going to question
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
that all i'm going to say is that i
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
think we ought to try to just stick with
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
the facts
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
and not do anything more than that thank
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative representative mclean
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so um constitutional
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
amendments are
 
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
very tricky things uh the constitutional
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that you referenced you know
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative macbeth
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
actually went through this house with
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
multiple sessions laboring over that
 
00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.470 align:start position:0%
multiple sessions laboring over that
language

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
and actually failed
 
00:26:21.269 --> 00:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
many times before we were at a place
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
where we were very comfortable with it
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
enough to send it off to the voters and
 
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
i think that the language in this
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
particular constitutional amendment is
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
incredibly incredibly
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
broad and
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
this committee recognized that um in the
 
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
last session where we had the cacr and
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
and we rejected it largely for that
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
reason now the sponsors said that really
 
00:26:49.919 --> 00:26:50.789 align:start position:0%
reason now the sponsors said that really
roe

00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:50.799 align:start position:0%
roe
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
we really think that row should be
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
the floor and we think that maybe we can
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
go beyond row
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
but where do you go beyond row
 
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
essentially this constitutional
 
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
amendment does leave that door wide open
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
there really hasn't been any discussion
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
at all
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
about where would that new ceiling be so
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
i really think given the breadth of this
 
00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.310 align:start position:0%
i really think given the breadth of this
amendment

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
in a post-role world if that were to
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
come to be um this is just not ready to
 
00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
go out to the voters at this point and i
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
to oppose it at this time thank you mr
 
00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:39.590 align:start position:0%
to oppose it at this time thank you mr
chair

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
i'm just here as a substitute
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
and on
 
00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
but i wanted to make my own background
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:27:49.919 --> 00:27:51.350 align:start position:0%
on this
known

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
known
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
my mother
 
00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.630 align:start position:0%
my mother
was

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
one of very few women
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
medical students during world war ii
 
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
she rotated through
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
what i would call
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
abortion wards
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
they were abortion wards not of people
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
that had come to get an abortion but of
 
00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
people who had gone to a back
 
00:28:16.399 --> 00:28:18.789 align:start position:0%
people who had gone to a back
door

00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
door
 
00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:20.630 align:start position:0%
door
illegal

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.789 align:start position:0%
illegal
abortionist

00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
abortionist
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
and someone who did not have sufficient
 
00:28:25.279 --> 00:28:26.630 align:start position:0%
and someone who did not have sufficient
training

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
they were all dying of sepsis and things
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
like that you cannot stop abortions
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
by outlawing them you can only make them
 
00:28:40.389 --> 00:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
highly unsafe
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
and i myself spent
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
25 years working
 
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
in third world countries
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
and i ran into a lot of doctors
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
that essentially condemned women to
 
00:28:53.919 --> 00:28:55.430 align:start position:0%
that essentially condemned women to
death

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
death
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
by telling them that they would not
 
00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
help them
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
in any way but usually it was
 
00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
contraception that they would not let
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
them have contraception
 
00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.110 align:start position:0%
them have contraception
but

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.389 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
i feel really strongly about this that
 
00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.149 align:start position:0%
i feel really strongly about this that
that

00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
that feel that they need abortions
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
that they cannot have an abortion
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
is in fact
 
00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
also possible can could be considered
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
murder thank you
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.029 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
comments

00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yes
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
there's a big difference between
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
demanding or commanding
 
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
an outcome
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
from a pregnancy and adopting a
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment
 
00:29:55.919 --> 00:29:57.590 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment
and

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
i don't believe
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
especially considering the diversity of
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
opinion within this committee and within
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
our society on this issue i certainly
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
don't believe it's
 
00:30:06.159 --> 00:30:07.269 align:start position:0%
don't believe it's
appropriate

00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
the only comment i'd have is the cons
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
the concern i have about the amendment
 
00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
um this is amending the constitution so
 
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
this is something that we should take
 
00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:31.039 align:start position:0%
very seriously obviously
 
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh it's not like a statutory change
 
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
where could you bring the microphone
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
it's not like a statute where we pass a
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
statute one year and we don't like it
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
then we
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
then we
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
repeal it the next year then
 
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
that can be done and so this is a
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment so i think we
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
need to be concerned about that my
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
concern with this particular
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment is the language
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
because the language is very broad and
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
subject i think to broad interpretation
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
we've all had this discussion about
 
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
abortion today but
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mention abortion at all in
 
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
the in the constitutional amendment it
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
talks about personal reproductive
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
medical decisions and the question is
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
how do you interpret that what is that
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
who's going to interpret that
 
00:31:18.559 --> 00:31:20.310 align:start position:0%
who's going to interpret that
and

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
if you concerned about the second
 
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.509 align:start position:0%
if you concerned about the second
amendment

00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:25.519 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
our arguments over what does it mean to
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
bear arms
 
00:31:30.549 --> 00:31:30.559 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about the language in it
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
uh i think the language should be
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
if we have a specific purpose in doing
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment the language should be
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
more specific
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
that's my thought
 
00:31:47.279 --> 00:31:48.710 align:start position:0%
that's my thought
representative

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
thank you just a brief comment and you
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
know how much i respect you chairman um
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
gordon as a jurist and as a chair of
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
this committee um
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
you know the the word privacy is not in
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
the united states constitution and we've
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
done a pretty good job as the 250 years
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
have gone i mean we're that's what our
 
00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
courts do our government i mean we are
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
an experiment and we have been moving
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
forward and refining
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
what those initial
 
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
principles meant for
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
hundreds of years now decades and i
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
really you know reproductive medical
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
decisions that's not going to be very
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
difficult i don't not think to be
 
00:32:28.399 --> 00:32:29.990 align:start position:0%
difficult i don't not think to be
defined

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
defined
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
and you know unduly inconvenient
 
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
it's just as the last um you know
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
amendment what is privacy and that i
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
think what's so important about this
 
00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.269 align:start position:0%
think what's so important about this
amendment

00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
is that it helps the courts define that
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
and it allows our citizens which when we
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
look at all of the polling that's coming
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
in over the last
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
specifically the last like i think 15
 
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
years it's
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
our citizens are telling us more and
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
more we want this right they're not
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
saying we want a certain procedure
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
that's not what they're saying they're
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
saying we want the right to make this
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
decision ourselves because it is so
 
00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.590 align:start position:0%
decision ourselves because it is so
controversial

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
controversial
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
because they want it to be private
 
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
however they make the decision
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
that's how i see this and that's why i'm
 
00:33:11.679 --> 00:33:12.630 align:start position:0%
that's how i see this and that's why i'm
asking

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
asking
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
my colleagues to really look at this
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's saying yes something that
 
00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.750 align:start position:0%
it's it's saying yes something that
affects

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
affects
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
our bodies so significantly our
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
financial our education our lives
 
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
forever as far as whether we have a
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
pregnancy or not whether we have an
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
abortion whether we give up a child for
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
adoption all those things are such
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
significant decisions that they are
 
00:33:32.399 --> 00:33:33.430 align:start position:0%
significant decisions that they are
private

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
private
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%

representative woburn seconded by
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
representative greene that this be ought
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
to pass as amended and you want to
 
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
address your amendment
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
i thank you mr chairman
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
so first of all
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's been understood or although not
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
widely recognized
 
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:12.069 align:start position:0%
widely recognized
that

00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
the the mother's rights
 
00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
to uh terminate to control her pregnancy
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
had to be balanced against other things
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
so the supreme court has explicitly
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
expressed the idea that at some point in
 
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
the pregnancy the state has the uh right
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
to interfere
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
in fact it says their duty to interfere
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
to the point where we can have uh
 
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
a ban that we have on in the fetal life
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
after viability
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
what hasn't been specifically addressed
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
in law
 
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
is the father
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
the father's rights
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that naturally the
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:57.359 --> 00:36:58.790 align:start position:0%
 
over

00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
his child
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
and its life
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
so this is an attempt
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
to encode
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
that right recognizing
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
that that right is subordinate
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
to the mother's right
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
subordinate to the state's right
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
but it's still a right
 
00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:20.829 align:start position:0%
but it's still a right
that

00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
exists and should be part of the
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
calculation of what happens
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
hearing on this bill there were several
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
objections that were raised
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
and this amendment
 
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
addresses those uh objections
 
00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.270 align:start position:0%
addresses those uh objections
concerns

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.310 align:start position:0%
 
was

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.510 align:start position:0%
was
uh

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
small thing
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
well was about what happens if the
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
juris the jurisdictional question what
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
if what if one of the parents is out of
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
state or
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
so the bill this amendment clarifies
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
that it has to be within the state of
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and it's only effective
 
00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.670 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and it's only effective
there

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns was the notification
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
provisions where it said the court would
 
00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.349 align:start position:0%
provisions where it said the court would
notify

00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
notify
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
the respondent right well the courts
 
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
don't notify respondents so this
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
amendment clarifies that it will be up
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
to the plaintiff to
 
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
notify the correspondent
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns was raised about the
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
legal cost to the mother
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
this amendment addresses that the father
 
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
will now be responsible for all the
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
legal costs of the mother
 
00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:37.839 align:start position:0%
another concern was
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
postpartum care for the mother and this
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
amendment addresses that as well the
 
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
father will provide six weeks of
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
postpartum medical care so
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
the only one that isn't addressed by the
 
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
amendment per se
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
was the question of
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
how do you decide
 
00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.190 align:start position:0%
how do you decide
when

00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
what kind of evidence is necessary for
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
the father to prove is right is is
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
worthy of consideration i think is the
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
way to put that
 
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
and and the answer is it's in the
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
structure of the bill
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
because the father has to attest has to
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
swear in his petition
 
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
that he believes himself to be the
 
00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.030 align:start position:0%
that he believes himself to be the
father

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
father
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
now there's only two ways that this can
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
go forward
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
one is that the mother
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't dispute
 
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
and the other she does if she does the
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
father can get dna testing
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
which he has to pay for
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
which would prove positive
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not he's the father
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
and if it doesn't then it proves he's
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
not and
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
there are other
 
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
we strengthen the fraudulent claim
 
00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
portion of this
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
to penalize uh fraudulent claims
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
so we believe that all of the objections
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
that were raised
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
during the hearing
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
and makes it a strong bill that should
 
00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
go forward to
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
identify in law that the father does
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so um
 
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:22.870 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so um
i

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
i really
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
support the concept of the bill and i i
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
think that it is
 
00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.790 align:start position:0%
think that it is
important

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
that we recognize
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
um that the father has some kind of
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
voice um and and to totally take away
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
that voice um
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
is is something
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
that is not right and so the the concept
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
of the bill i think you know has merit
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to the standard
 
00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
when the standard when you say the
 
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
standard is really kind of laid out in
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
the structure of the bill
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
in this legislation is to maintain
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
parity it's to give the father some kind
 
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
of voice and define what that should be
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
so i really think that you know while
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment goes away over the
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
original bill i would still recommend
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
that we we study this and get a better
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
understanding of what exactly we think
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
that voice should be but to say the
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
standard is tied up in the structure i
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
just don't think that that has enough
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
clarity for me so i will be opposing the
 
00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:29.510 align:start position:0%
clarity for me so i will be opposing the
amendment

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
representative alexander thank you mr
 
00:41:31.599 --> 00:41:32.870 align:start position:0%
representative alexander thank you mr
chair

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
i i agree with representative mclean um
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
this clearly needs more study my big
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
concern is the um
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
what what happens uh with the court um
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of language in here saying
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
that cases shall be heard within a
 
00:41:49.109 --> 00:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
certain time period
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
and that concerns me i mean there's a
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
timeliness needed in a situation like
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
this especially during a pregnancy
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
and then it goes up against our modest
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
changes in
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
the six-month
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
fetal life protection act that we just
 
00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
put in place and how does that um affect
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
this legislation as well so i think we
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
need to study it more um the concept is
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
okay but i'm i'm still a little
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
apprehensive i need i need to learn
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
other questions or comments
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i think i agree
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
with my two colleagues on this that it
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
really does need more study i understand
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
fathers should have rights too but i
 
00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.470 align:start position:0%
fathers should have rights too but i
also

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately have even had experience
 
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
with my own
 
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.190 align:start position:0%
with my own
um

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
ex-husband of the the fathers sometimes
 
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
they do it just because they want to get
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
back at
 
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
the wife or i worry more about the child
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
who then is going to be born and
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
supposedly going to be taken care of by
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
a dad who really is doing it for the
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
wrong reasons that frightens me so
 
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
that's why i would like to have it
 
00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
studied more find out how many fathers
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
really have been denied
 
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
how many um
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
i just don't feel as enough check into
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
the father's background of being a good
 
00:43:10.319 --> 00:43:11.510 align:start position:0%
the father's background of being a good
parent

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
parent
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to bring this forward and let
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
them make that decision and take a child
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
they could decide
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's too much work i don't want to do
 
00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.390 align:start position:0%
it's too much work i don't want to do
this

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
and that's just how i feel about it
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
other comments or questions
 
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i might have
 
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
missed something in in the amendment and
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
i would ask the
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the amendment
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
knowing of his
 
00:43:43.359 --> 00:43:45.030 align:start position:0%
knowing of his
commitment

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.910 align:start position:0%
commitment
to

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
the product of
 
00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.190 align:start position:0%
the product of
a

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
a reproduction here
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
i see nothing in this
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
legislation or in your amendment that
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
would indicate
 
00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
any continuing
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility on the part of
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
the putative father
 
00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:12.630 align:start position:0%
the putative father
for

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:44:17.349 --> 00:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
the care and upbringing of the um
 
00:44:17.359 --> 00:44:19.030 align:start position:0%
the care and upbringing of the um
of

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
what is now
 
00:44:25.109 --> 00:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
a baby functioning outside of the woman
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
about food clothing or shelter of this
 
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
product i don't see anything about child
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
care about access to health care
 
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
about any responsibility that any
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
responsible parent
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
should undertake
 
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
if what we have done is interfered with
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
a woman's right to control what happens
 
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
in her own body
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
and there is now a product
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
of that relationship that may or may not
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
actually be the relationship
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
and there's no indication that there's
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
anything that we care about we don't
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
care seem to care in this about
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
the baby
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
we only care
 
00:45:17.599 --> 00:45:18.470 align:start position:0%
we only care
about

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
the right of someone who brings himself
 
00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
forward to say he's the father and so
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
that's my concern what happens if there
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
is no abortion and then where are we and
 
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
i would hope
 
00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:35.990 align:start position:0%
i would hope
knowing

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
knowing
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
that the sponsor is a caring thoughtful
 
00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.150 align:start position:0%
that the sponsor is a caring thoughtful
individual

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
that he
 
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
would want to go back to the drawing
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
board to recognize
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
a lifelong obligation
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
to the product of this decision thank
 
00:45:51.599 --> 00:45:55.349 align:start position:0%
to the product of this decision thank
you

00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
other comments or questions
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative chase do you want to
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
speak again thank you i i just wanted to
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
clarify what i was saying my ex-husband
 
00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:05.839 align:start position:0%
i didn't have an abortion we have two
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
children together who he fought to take
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
care of
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
and never did and i was constantly
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
taking him to court
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
for child support for helping so that's
 
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying here's a guy who fought
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
fought saying he's going to take care of
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
these kids and he never
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
stepped up to the plate that's my fear
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to raise a child when
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
they're wondering what happened to their
 
00:46:27.599 --> 00:46:34.069 align:start position:0%
they're wondering what happened to their
dad

00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative wolper
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate the thoughtful
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
responses and concerns that have been
 
00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.710 align:start position:0%
responses and concerns that have been
raised

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
raised
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to start at the back and go
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
back to the front
 
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
the concern about the well-being of the
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
child after it's born
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
the father petitions the court
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
to become the father in order according
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
to the bill in order that he may have
 
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
and raise the child
 
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
once that child is born
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
the father has sworn
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
in his petition
 
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
that he is the father
 
00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
and he wants to raise and care for the
 
00:47:12.319 --> 00:47:13.589 align:start position:0%
and he wants to raise and care for the
child

00:47:13.589 --> 00:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
we have a plethora
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
of laws that deal with fathers
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to born children
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
that does not need to be part of this
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
bill that isn't the purpose of this bill
 
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
and there's no reason why it would be
 
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
because they already exist
 
00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:30.150 align:start position:0%
because they already exist
so

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
so there's that
 
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
as far as uh the other concerns that are
 
00:47:37.829 --> 00:47:37.839 align:start position:0%
there some of these are difficult to
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
struggle with
 
00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.150 align:start position:0%
struggle with
um

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:42.559 align:start position:0%
i agree how does the court decide when a
 
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
minority right
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
should trump
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
the more
 
00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:49.839 align:start position:0%
significant right if i want to call it
 
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
that of the mother that's a hard call to
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
make i don't know how you you encode
 
00:47:54.319 --> 00:47:55.190 align:start position:0%
make i don't know how you you encode
that

00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
into any kind of law that's a judgment
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
call that would have to be made on a
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
case basis so i don't see that as a
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
reason for not going forward with this
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
and with that mr chairman i'll just say
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
i'll call the role no
 
00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.069 align:start position:0%
i'll call the role no
actually

00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
i think we should give other people an
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.230 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
i think we're getting at my question but
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
my question was specifically why under
 
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
fraudulent claims it does say that the
 
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
man would be required to pay monthly
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
child support until the child has
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
obtained the age of 18 years
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
but it's not mirrored if if there is an
 
00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:41.670 align:start position:0%
but it's not mirrored if if there is an
injunction

00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
injunction
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
that same language is not mirrored so if
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's an injunction
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
the requirement to pay monthly child
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
support is not
 
00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
is not also required and i do understand
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
thank you answered part of my question
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative welper
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
which is the um
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
the law does already deal with that
 
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
i haven't talked much yet this morning
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
the law does already deal with that but
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
and my feeling is that there should be a
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
higher standard for a father who puts
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
a mother in through this whole
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
process there might be a higher standard
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
to their responsibility to
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative all me
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
thank you maybe this is covered but i'm
 
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
not seeing it
 
00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:41.990 align:start position:0%
not seeing it
on

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
assuming that you're talking about
 
00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:46.069 align:start position:0%
assuming that you're talking about
a

00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:49:46.079 --> 00:49:48.309 align:start position:0%
a
ex-boyfriend

00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
ex-boyfriend
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
that has ill intent
 
00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:52.390 align:start position:0%
that has ill intent
on

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
could they
 
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
on make
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
this claim just before the woman is
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
about to have an abortion
 
00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.230 align:start position:0%
about to have an abortion
and

00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
at that point because she had been
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
delaying it trying to avoid what she
 
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
thought is the necessity
 
00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.230 align:start position:0%
thought is the necessity
on

00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
trigger the 24-week
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
ban by the time all of this stuff has
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
been finished
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
we want to answer that question
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative wolf thank you mr
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah so the bill says that the
 
00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
whole thing has to pre has to proceed
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
in such a way that we don't violate the
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
existing law of 24 weeks so if the
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
woman's uh
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
close to that and then petition comes
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
forward i'm pretty confident the court
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
would just say
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
we can't deal with this in the time
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
before we would be violating the law and
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
according to this bill
 
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
we can't deal with it
 
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:53.589 align:start position:0%
we can't deal with it
but

00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:56.559 align:start position:0%
they have that right thank you on i
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
my thought
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
on it was
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh as far as the amendment is concerned
 
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment probably improves what was
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
originally presented and i really
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any problem
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
voting for the amendment itself
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
and the the other part of it is i i
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
think i agree that in some respects
 
00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:29.990 align:start position:0%
think i agree that in some respects
a

00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.109 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
male portion
 
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
should have a voice of some type
 
00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.030 align:start position:0%
should have a voice of some type
and

00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.069 align:start position:0%
and
but

00:51:38.069 --> 00:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
it's the mechanics that are the problem
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
here you know how does that how do you
 
00:51:43.589 --> 00:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
make that happen
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
and i just don't think at this point in
 
00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:47.430 align:start position:0%
and i just don't think at this point in
time

00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
this bill is ready with regard to
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
properly forming the
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
mechanics of
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
giving that person the voice
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
and i think it would require a little
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
bit of
 
00:51:59.040 --> 00:51:59.750 align:start position:0%
bit of
and

00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
but i think it's something that we
 
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
should study and we should look at and
 
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that we come up with the right
 
00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:10.549 align:start position:0%
make sure that we come up with the right
product

00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
so we have a motion this is a motion on

address your motion please uh
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
pardon a lot of my concern lies in
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
section one of the bill um it shall be
 
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
public policy new hampshire that because
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
it is vital to the equality and liberty
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
of all individuals
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
we're forgetting the equality of liberty
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
of the unborn in this legislation
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
this legislation also creates a separate
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
um right of action against the state for
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
injunctive relief
 
00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
typically i've in the past been opposed
 
00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:40.789 align:start position:0%
typically i've in the past been opposed
to

00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
adding new causes of action against the
 
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
state i think the existing laws would
 
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
provide for
 
00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:48.069 align:start position:0%
provide for
relief

00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
relief
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
so for that reason i just hope my
 
00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
colleagues follow me and vote and
 
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
representative simpson did you yeah yes
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:04.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'll be voting
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
against the itl on this bill
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to say that multiple
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
generations of women and girls have had
 
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
access to safe legal abortion since roe
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
v wade was decided 49 years ago
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's highly likely that roe v wade will
 
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
be overturned by the supreme court this
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
year if that happens the rights of women
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
and girls in new hampshire
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
will no longer be protected federally
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
this bill would would ensure what
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
already exists here in new hampshire
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
access to safe legal abortions for women
 
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
and girls
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
up until the current ban in statute at
 
00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
24 weeks
 
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
the new 24-week abortion ban
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
is in statute and i'm asking we are
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
asking that the rights of women and
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
girls be placed in law next to the
 
00:59:54.319 --> 00:59:55.910 align:start position:0%
girls be placed in law next to the
restrictions

00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
the first question i have is
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
reproductive rights
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that reproductive rights
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
means the right to reproduce
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that reproduction occurs
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
at the time of conception
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
and after conception we're no longer
 
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
talking about reproductive rights we're
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
talking about some other kind of rights
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
like the rights to medical treatment or
 
01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:46.630 align:start position:0%
like the rights to medical treatment or
something

01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
right which don't have actually anything
 
01:00:50.069 --> 01:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
to do with reproduction because it's
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
representative simpson would you like to
 
01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
respond to that
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
abortion care is a form of health care
 
01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
and the reproductive system
 
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
is a system that is part
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
of all of us but i'll speak for myself
 
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
as a woman the reproductive system and
 
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
all that
 
01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
happens within it and belongs to it is
 
01:01:17.839 --> 01:01:19.190 align:start position:0%
happens within it and belongs to it is
um

01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
includes the entire spectrum of care
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
related to the reproductive system so i
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
don't think that
 
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
rights to reproduction
 
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
is only about
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative wolper
 
01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.270 align:start position:0%
representative wolper
so

01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
if we if we enact this would a child of
 
01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.750 align:start position:0%
if we if we enact this would a child of
say

01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.670 align:start position:0%
say
13

01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
13
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
have the right to reproduce
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:04.789 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
i respectfully don't believe that that
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
is the part of the bill
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to address that here
 
01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:12.799 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to have that conversation with
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%

01:02:14.559 --> 01:02:18.069 align:start position:0%

sam right that's correct okay i've been
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
11 in the affirmative eight in the
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
negative so we on house bill 1674 we've

adopted the recommendation of an
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate would there be a

point in terms of abortion but i would
 
01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
direct people to uh line number nine
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
in the document and it talks about
 
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
the unborn human individual and line
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
number ten says from fertilization until
 
01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
live birth i think if we implemented
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
this law that it would ins it would undo
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
the ban that we currently have
 
01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
on the 24 week abortion and bring it
 
01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
from the date of conception on
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
the other comment that i would make is
 
01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
a heartbeat there's a lot of electronic
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
responses that can be picked up
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
from a person's cardiology from
 
01:20:46.629 --> 01:20:46.639 align:start position:0%
at any point in their life and that
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
could easily be misconstrued as a
 
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:03.189 --> 01:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:06.229 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
i

01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:08.719 align:start position:0%
i think that you know this this
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
legislation um
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
really does kind of go up
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
against roe and
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to support it anyway
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
because i really think that this
 
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
legislation is very
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
timely because it's addressing
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
the question
 
01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:27.510 align:start position:0%
the question
of

01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0%
where we place value and how do we place
 
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
value on the fetus and how does that
 
01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:36.390 align:start position:0%
value on the fetus and how does that
value

01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
value
 
01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
evolve and you know if i could just
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
kind of illustrate a point by not going
 
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
back to roe but by going back to a
 
01:21:48.629 --> 01:21:48.639 align:start position:0%
different supreme court case 170 years
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
ago when we looked at the dred scott
 
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
decision the dred scott decision was
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
probably the most horrible decision that
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
the supreme court ever brought forth in
 
01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
which a black man who was living free
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
dred scott was essentially
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
put back into
 
01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
slavery and you ask yourself how could
 
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
that happen
 
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
with the people on the supreme court
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
just not smart
 
01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
how could that have happened and what
 
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
the reason it was able to happen really
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
is not that they were dumb but it's
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
where they placed value and they did not
 
01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:28.070 align:start position:0%
where they placed value and they did not
place

01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
value on dred scott a black man the way
 
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
that they placed value on a white man he
 
01:22:38.629 --> 01:22:38.639 align:start position:0%
had value for sure but more as property
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
like your toyota tacoma or something
 
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
like that now you fast forward in time
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
170 years to where we are now
 
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
we go back and for all the problems that
 
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
we have in this country there's nobody
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
in in this room in this state house in
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
this state that would ever defend the
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
dred scott decision
 
01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is that our
 
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
understanding of our humanity has
 
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
evolved and we understand that
 
01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
regardless of our skin color we are all
 
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
equally human now we go back and we look
 
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
at the row decision
 
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
where did the row decision assign value
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
the row decision assigned value with the
 
01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
privacy of the woman which i think is is
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
a great thing you know women should have
 
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
privacy and it also acknowledged that a
 
01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
woman has sovereignty over her own body
 
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
which is again something that i could
 
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
really get behind and defend and when it
 
01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
was put against the fetus they said well
 
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
maybe later on in the pregnancy
 
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
we have to have something but we
 
01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:50.790 align:start position:0%
we have to have something but we
certainly

01:23:50.790 --> 01:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to subordinate these rights
 
01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
of women if all we're subordinating it
 
01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
to is essentially
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
a bunch of cells
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
and if that was the case
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
i would be the number one defender of
 
01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:06.790 align:start position:0%
i would be the number one defender of
roe

01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
roe
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it is the case
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
and 50 years on our understanding of the
 
01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:14.870 align:start position:0%
and 50 years on our understanding of the
fetus

01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
fetus
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
has really evolved and as
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
our understanding has evolved and got
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
much better with all this technology our
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
value the value that we place on the
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
fetus has gone up and up and up and it
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter if the heartbeat
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
at seven weeks is a real heartbeat or um
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's just electrical impulses
 
01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:42.639 align:start position:0%
what it's an indication of and what
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
we're understanding now is it's an
 
01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
indication of an individual
 
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
human entity and so what happens is not
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
that our value of a woman's privacy or
 
01:24:59.110 --> 01:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
sovereignty over her body has gone down
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
but just that our value of the fetus
 
01:25:05.189 --> 01:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
goes up and up and up the more we learn
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
so at this point in time where
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
everything really is in flux
 
01:25:13.110 --> 01:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
this bill i think is a very important
 
01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
bill for reassessing that value and and
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
i think we should support it thank you
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
other questions or comments
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:25:29.189 --> 01:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
your patience uh i apologize for being
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
late but um
 
01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:31.350 align:start position:0%
late but um
the

01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
um what's what it says in the state
 
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
constitution the federal constitution
 
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
they talk about the inalienable rights
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
that humans have it's always uh from
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
birth and um so our
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
i mean our understanding
 
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
our knowledge about uh
 
01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
embryonic and fetal develops more than
 
01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
there was before but the theory that
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
they had back then was its broad
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
outlines pretty similar to what we have
 
01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
now so i think the constitutional
 
01:25:56.229 --> 01:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
provision about birth still still
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
applies especially given that um
 
01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
a large percentage of uh large a large
 
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
percentage of pregnancies um don't go to
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
term anyway even even in the absence of
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
a you know deliberate abortion so that's
 
01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:10.470 align:start position:0%
a you know deliberate abortion so that's
uh

01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:11.350 align:start position:0%
uh
um

01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
i think so if we pass this law that kind
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
of muddies the waters a bit because it's
 
01:26:16.390 --> 01:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
a definition unborn human individual
 
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
which is from conception and i
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
understand why that's appealing to a lot
 
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
of people but that's
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with what uh
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
our constitutional other law has said
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
for for centuries so that's
 
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
that's one reason why i'll be voting
 
01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
against this bill thanks
 
01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
representative chase thank you mr chair
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to address what uh
 
01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:42.639 align:start position:0%
representative maclean was saying
 
01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned about noises
 
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
basically that maybe a heartbeat may not
 
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
be this is about having a fetal
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
heartbeat how are you just saying that
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
when it's a bunch of cells and you can
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
hear noise
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
you're considering that a heartbeat i
 
01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure i was clear of
 
01:26:59.910 --> 01:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
i'm saying
 
01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
that there was testimony in the public
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
hearing that um
 
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
when they are detecting the fetal
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
heartbeat was it a fully formed heart
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:27:14.719 --> 01:27:15.990 align:start position:0%
i think
that

01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
obviously it's not a fully formed heart
 
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
because at six weeks you can't survive
 
01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
outside of the womb but it doesn't mean
 
01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
that it's not a heart and it doesn't
 
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
mean that there isn't something that is
 
01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
going on from an electromagnetic
 
01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:33.030 align:start position:0%
going on from an electromagnetic
perspective

01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative nader thank you mr
 
01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:41.750 align:start position:0%
representative nader thank you mr
chairman

01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative maclean for
 
01:27:45.189 --> 01:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
what you said i agree with you one
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
hundred percent
 
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
dr seuss said a person is a person no
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
matter how small and the feed the word
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
fetus is a latin word that means little
 
01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:55.350 align:start position:0%
fetus is a latin word that means little
one

01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
and you had mentioned slavery which of
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
course is a horrible thing
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
horrible horrible thing we all know that
 
01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
now and i i think maybe someday people
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
in the future will look back to
 
01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:07.350 align:start position:0%
in the future will look back to
us

01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
in today's world and wonder how we ever
 
01:28:11.350 --> 01:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
could have supported
 
01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
abortion so i know this bill is not
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
going to pass but i i can't vote against
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
it so
 
01:28:20.709 --> 01:28:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
other questions or comments
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
represent well me
 
01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:26.830 align:start position:0%

01:28:29.189 --> 01:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
you i was
 
01:28:29.199 --> 01:28:30.550 align:start position:0%
you i was
26

01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
26
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
when i passed
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
i grew up in the time
 
01:28:35.679 --> 01:28:37.030 align:start position:0%
i grew up in the time
when

01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
if you were became of reproductive age
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
and you were female you were
 
01:28:42.719 --> 01:28:44.229 align:start position:0%
and you were female you were
either

01:28:44.229 --> 01:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
couldn't

01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
you had to always think
 
01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
if i do something
 
01:28:58.390 --> 01:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
something wrong or walk down the wrong
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
street go out at night etc
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
yes with a child but with a child that
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
established what my the next 18 years at
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
least of my life was going to be
 
01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
this is not just a matter of privacy
 
01:29:28.709 --> 01:29:28.719 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of enslavement of women
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
and that's what it felt like in those
 
01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:33.750 align:start position:0%
and that's what it felt like in those
days

01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
and that's what
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
you're trying to get it back to and i
 
01:29:38.639 --> 01:29:39.510 align:start position:0%
you're trying to get it back to and i
think

01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:46.229 --> 01:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
i know from the polling that this state
 
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
does not agree
 
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
01:29:53.189 --> 01:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
maybe it would head in that direction i
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
hope i won't be alive at that point
 
01:29:57.110 --> 01:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:59.189 --> 01:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
okay representative alexander thank you
 
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
mr chair um personally when it comes to
 
01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:02.639 align:start position:0%
these issues i don't really care what
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
public polling says this is really a
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
personal moral issue
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
to each and every individual
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
what i would say this is that at the end
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
of life when doctors determine when the
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
end of life is it is
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
when the heartbeat stops
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm just asking we have the same we
 
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
treat life at the beginning when the
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
heartbeat starts that is when life
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
begins and the state has an obligation
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
to protect life so at the end of life
 
01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
i'm asking we have the same
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
other comments questions
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
i just have a comment that
 
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of talk throughout
 
01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
this country throughout this state about
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
self-determination and against
 
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
government mandates
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
if this bill were passed then
 
01:30:58.709 --> 01:30:58.719 align:start position:0%
there would be a mandate prohibiting
 
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
women from having abortions
 
01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
and i think it's wrong thank you
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comment
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
representative langley
 
01:31:15.750 --> 01:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
i've just thank you mr chair just one
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
final comment
 
01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:18.149 align:start position:0%
final comment
and

01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
it goes beyond this particular bill i
 
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
think to some of the testimony that
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
we've heard as we've gone along
 
01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
this session around
 
01:31:26.239 --> 01:31:27.830 align:start position:0%
this session around
vaccination

01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
and covet and how people have responded
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
to that
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
and i've listened as people have come in
 
01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
and they've been very articulate and
 
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
very passionate
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
about saying how they felt about their
 
01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
freedom being violated because
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
there has been encouragement either to
 
01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
wear a mask or become vaccinated etc and
 
01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
that they needed to make their own
 
01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:50.629 align:start position:0%
that they needed to make their own
choice

01:31:50.629 --> 01:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
choice
 
01:31:53.110 --> 01:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
i just find it really exceptionally
 
01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
confusing when i think about
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
right to life issues abortion issues and
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
reproductive issues
 
01:32:03.510 --> 01:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
that as a woman i'm not able to make
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
that decision in consultation with
 
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
whoever is most significant in my life
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to be said here so i'd
 
01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
like to follow a couple different
 
01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:23.910 align:start position:0%
like to follow a couple different
threads

01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
threads
 
01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
the first one is where representative
 
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
mclean started but i don't want to start
 
01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
what he did
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
i want to go back to the foundation of
 
01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
our country and the declaration of
 
01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:33.990 align:start position:0%

founded
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
on the idea
 
01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:42.229 align:start position:0%
on the idea
that

01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
and among those rights are the right to
 
01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:54.550 align:start position:0%
and among those rights are the right to

01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
life is not created by us
 
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:01.520 align:start position:0%

independence
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
unalienable that means it cannot be
 
01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.750 align:start position:0%
unalienable that means it cannot be
separated

01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
separated
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
from your own self
 
01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
when it is it is and forever protected
 
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
as an unalienable
 
01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:22.390 align:start position:0%
as an unalienable
right

01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
according to that
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
life began and we know
 
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
from embryology
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
that life
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
human life
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
every life begins at conception
 
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
not at six weeks not at 16 weeks or 24
 
01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
weeks it begins at conception so if this
 
01:33:42.629 --> 01:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
is unalienable right
 
01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
and it begins at conception it should be
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
protected from conception
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
now it's true we don't know
 
01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:52.790 align:start position:0%
now it's true we don't know
when

01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
that human life actually begins
 
01:33:59.110 --> 01:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
in the sense that we don't have any way
 
01:33:59.120 --> 01:33:59.990 align:start position:0%
in the sense that we don't have any way
of

01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
of identifying
 
01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
that that life exists
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
right as we've heard now the testimony
 
01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
women don't know they're pregnant for
 
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
weeks after the time that they become
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
pregnant but they are and the life has
 
01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
been living within them
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
the purpose of government
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
is to secure our rights back to the
 
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
declaration of independence
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
so why isn't it for i believe it is the
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
purpose of government to protect human
 
01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:35.110 align:start position:0%
purpose of government to protect human
life

01:34:35.110 --> 01:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
when you get to dred scott
 
01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
the supreme court said
 
01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
that class of people
 
01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
and denied
 
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
their inalienable right to life
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
when we come to roe versus wade
 
01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
the supreme court said
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
we don't know
 
01:35:03.669 --> 01:35:03.679 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
01:35:03.679 --> 01:35:05.590 align:start position:0%
we don't
know

01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
what that thing in the womb
 
01:35:08.159 --> 01:35:10.390 align:start position:0%
what that thing in the womb
is

01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to say
 
01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
that a woman
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
has the right to control that thing in
 
01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
her womb she owns it
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:28.629 --> 01:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
we do know and as the supreme court said
 
01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
in roe versus wade if we did know
 
01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:34.229 align:start position:0%
in roe versus wade if we did know
that

01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
product of conception
 
01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
would be protected
 
01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
because it has the unalienable right to
 
01:35:41.119 --> 01:35:42.790 align:start position:0%
because it has the unalienable right to
life

01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
and we sit here today
 
01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:47.830 align:start position:0%
and we sit here today
knowing

01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
and argue about
 
01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:50.470 align:start position:0%
and argue about
well

01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
just because it's not a real heartbeat
 
01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
are you kidding me
 
01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
we know what that is that's a person it
 
01:35:59.669 --> 01:35:59.679 align:start position:0%
can be nothing else
 
01:35:59.679 --> 01:36:00.470 align:start position:0%
can be nothing else
p

01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
p
 
01:36:03.189 --> 01:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
every organism reproduces after its own
 
01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
kind a woman does not bring forth a
 
01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:06.790 align:start position:0%
kind a woman does not bring forth a
grapefruit

01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
grapefruit
 
01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
or a sheep
 
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
she brings forth another human being
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
and it deserves
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
the protection of its unalienable right
 
01:36:20.229 --> 01:36:20.239 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll just
 
01:36:20.239 --> 01:36:22.310 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll just
say

01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
that if we look at the what we're doing
 
01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
in that light
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
then the regime that has allowed over 60
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
million babies to be killed
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
killed intentionally killed that's what
 
01:36:36.629 --> 01:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
abortion is intentional killing of its
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
baby allowed over 60 million
 
01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
human beings to be killed
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
with no protection
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
is the greatest human rights violation
 
01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
of all time
 
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
and i'll be supporting the bill
 
01:36:53.830 --> 01:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative nader
 
01:36:55.990 --> 01:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman they knew what
 
01:36:59.189 --> 01:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
that thing was in the year 70 a.d in the
 
01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
teaching of the 12 i'm going to spell it
 
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
d-i-d-a-c-h-e i pronounced it did it say
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
could be wrong it says in chapter 2 that
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
you shall not
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:16.149 --> 01:37:16.159 align:start position:0%
representative green
 
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
to add on what's already been said just
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
a couple of from my own perspective
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
about half a lifetime ago my wife and i
 
01:37:25.510 --> 01:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
were trying to conceive
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:30.070 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
in all this discussion there's this
 
01:37:34.629 --> 01:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
from what we've heard today from what we
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
heard last week in rep's hall
 
01:37:36.719 --> 01:37:37.590 align:start position:0%
heard last week in rep's hall
there's

01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:37:40.470 --> 01:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
just virtually no discussion about
 
01:37:43.590 --> 01:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
the alternative adoption
 
01:37:46.229 --> 01:37:46.239 align:start position:0%
adoption attorney told us 30 years ago
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
that for every healthy infant available
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
there's a hundred couples that want it
 
01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:53.910 align:start position:0%
there's a hundred couples that want it
so

01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
we we couldn't adopt it just there's
 
01:37:57.910 --> 01:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
just too many obstacles we couldn't do
 
01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
it now a lot of people are successful
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
and it's become easier over the years
 
01:38:01.679 --> 01:38:03.109 align:start position:0%
and it's become easier over the years
with

01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
when we did it was pre-internet and now
 
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
there's much more of a phenomenon of
 
01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
international adoption and all that but
 
01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
back in the day that's what we're up
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
against so
 
01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:14.390 align:start position:0%
against so
that's

01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
that was the first thing
 
01:38:18.709 --> 01:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
that helped me evolve
 
01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
on this issue
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
and i i think the second thing is i just
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
think of myself from recent years
 
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
we as a society
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
01:38:33.109 --> 01:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
answer the ultimate question
 
01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
does that growing
 
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
human being in a woman's body does it
 
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
have value
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
either it does
 
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:50.709 --> 01:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
any other comments representative
 
01:38:54.149 --> 01:38:54.159 align:start position:0%
lorenzo thank you mr chairman um one of
 
01:38:54.159 --> 01:38:54.950 align:start position:0%
lorenzo thank you mr chairman um one of
the

01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
former speakers here
 
01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned the inalienable rights
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
in our constitution um
 
01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
and he said life
 
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
liberty and pursuit of happiness
 
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
so it's a three it's a three-part
 
01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:13.590 align:start position:0%
so it's a three it's a three-part
right

01:39:13.590 --> 01:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:16.709 align:start position:0%
right
liberty

01:39:16.709 --> 01:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
allows us to make decisions about our
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
own bodies
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
the pursuit of happiness
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
um allows us to make decisions about our
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%

a comment from my colleague um and just
 
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
to say
 
01:39:51.109 --> 01:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh representative walper if i may how
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
much i deeply respect your faith and
 
01:39:57.990 --> 01:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
your commitment to this issue and
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
would like to state that i
 
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.109 align:start position:0%
would like to state that i
myself

01:40:01.109 --> 01:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:40:03.669 --> 01:40:03.679 align:start position:0%
have a deep faith
 
01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
in my creator and that that is very
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
important to me
 
01:40:11.189 --> 01:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
but i would also like to speak for those
 
01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
whose faith may differ from mine
 
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
and who may
 
01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
differ from yours
 
01:40:19.270 --> 01:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
and may have their own faith that i
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
think it's really important that we
 
01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:23.510 align:start position:0%
think it's really important that we
allow

01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
allow
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
individuals women who are pregnant
 
01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:27.910 align:start position:0%
individuals women who are pregnant
to

01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
make the decisions that they need to
 
01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
make based on the law that we have in
 
01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:33.510 align:start position:0%
make based on the law that we have in
statute

01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
the decisions that they need to make
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
based on their own
 
01:40:39.669 --> 01:40:39.679 align:start position:0%
religious life their own faith their own
 
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
spiritual life if they
 
01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:44.159 align:start position:0%
do have that or not if they don't that
 
01:40:46.709 --> 01:40:46.719 align:start position:0%
they are able to make decisions based on
 
01:40:47.830 --> 01:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
their own
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
weighing their own factors in their
 
01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
lives that are important to them and to
 
01:40:56.149 --> 01:40:56.159 align:start position:0%
their families and to their communities
 
01:40:56.159 --> 01:40:56.950 align:start position:0%
their families and to their communities
and

01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
representative oregon thank you very
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
much mr chair and i um
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
the we we we were yeah reverend welper
 
01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
recently he started with the idea which
 
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
he thought was universal is that
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
there is a creator but that's even
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
that's not a universally shared opinion
 
01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:21.270 align:start position:0%
that's not a universally shared opinion
um

01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
and even if you know there
 
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
even if there was a creator who being
 
01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
who's somehow similar to us human beings
 
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
we don't necessarily know what his her
 
01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
it's uh their
 
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
agenda is so it's pretty presumptuous to
 
01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
like uh you know
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
to just sort of seem that a creator
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
would definitely take uh you know
 
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
the position that the sponsors bill's
 
01:41:45.510 --> 01:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
doing in the issue and certainly
 
01:41:47.669 --> 01:41:47.679 align:start position:0%
every species uh
 
01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
you know every species you know
 
01:41:52.229 --> 01:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh produces you know a lot more uh you
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
know conceives you know a lot more
 
01:41:55.990 --> 01:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
individuals than are actually actually
 
01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
born the human you know the humans um
 
01:41:58.950 --> 01:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
humans we actually have one of the
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
highest success rates you know like
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
because most most uh
 
01:42:05.669 --> 01:42:05.679 align:start position:0%
most babies are born who are conceit
 
01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
most you know most uh you know conceived
 
01:42:08.159 --> 01:42:09.109 align:start position:0%
most you know most uh you know conceived
um

01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
embryos uh do eventually develop in a
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
reasonably healthy human being we're
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
pretty rare in that regard so i um
 
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
anyway i just just want to say the
 
01:42:20.229 --> 01:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not you're as a creator
 
01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't really uh
 
01:42:23.109 --> 01:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't really have much to do whether
 
01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
or not this bill is a good idea and i
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's been an excellent debate here but
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's a debate that not only happens here
 
01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
it happens everywhere with
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
people having differences of opinion
 
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
honest differences of opinion
 
01:42:53.590 --> 01:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:55.679 align:start position:0%
my dear clerk next to me who does all
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
the work and i take all the credit um
 
01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:00.470 align:start position:0%
the work and i take all the credit um
and

01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
and and for all sides of the argument i
 
01:43:06.149 --> 01:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
guess the way i've tried to think about
 
01:43:08.070 --> 01:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
this and and
 
01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:09.270 align:start position:0%
this and and
it's

01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:17.109 --> 01:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
my good clerk's argument about
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
when does life actually started
 
01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
if it starts at conception and you
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
believe it starts at conception
 
01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
and you believe it shouldn't be taken
 
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
then i'm not sure deciding that when it
 
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
has an electrical pulse is the right
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
time to decide whether
 
01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
it should be terminated
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
i think if you intellectually look at it
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be terminated at all as
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
opposed to at that particular given time
 
01:43:44.719 --> 01:43:46.149 align:start position:0%
opposed to at that particular given time
so

01:43:46.149 --> 01:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:43:52.149 --> 01:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
we've just passed this law that says uh
 
01:43:52.159 --> 01:43:53.030 align:start position:0%
we've just passed this law that says uh
that

01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:56.470 --> 01:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
you can't have uh
 
01:43:59.109 --> 01:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
a board of services after 24 weeks and
 
01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
which has only been been in effect less
 
01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
than two months at this point in time
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
which appears to be reasonable and
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
clearly we can pass reasonable
 
01:44:08.950 --> 01:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
restrictions on abortion
 
01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure saying
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
that six weeks is reasonable
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
if you believe
 
01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
and i know you wouldn't believe but if
 
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
you do believe that women should have a
 
01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable choice at some point in time
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
i just think
 
01:44:27.510 --> 01:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
six weeks probably isn't
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
that right time
 
01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
on that basis and just want to let
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%

and representative page you want to

address your motion yes thank you mr
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
i think the current
 
01:46:38.310 --> 01:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
buffer zone we have in place
 
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
satisfies constitutional muster but let
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
me back up and say that
 
01:46:44.470 --> 01:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
i certainly understand that um the first
 
01:46:46.390 --> 01:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
amendment freedom of speech is
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
a protected right certainly and
 
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
certainly when it relates to civil
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
political discourse
 
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
or opinions but it's not an unfettered
 
01:46:55.270 --> 01:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
right and it's not unfettered right even
 
01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
when that speech is exercised on the
 
01:46:56.719 --> 01:46:58.950 align:start position:0%
when that speech is exercised on the
sidewalk

01:46:58.950 --> 01:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
sidewalk
 
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
regarding new hampshire's
 
01:47:03.199 --> 01:47:04.149 align:start position:0%
regarding new hampshire's
law

01:47:04.149 --> 01:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with a buffer zone
 
01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
that in my view
 
01:47:11.430 --> 01:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
is the new hampshire way
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
we heard how it was carefully crafted
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
to respond to
 
01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
the supreme court's decision mccollum
 
01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
which had struck down
 
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
portions of the massachusetts law
 
01:47:26.709 --> 01:47:26.719 align:start position:0%
like many things from our
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
southern neighbor new hampshire we do a
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
little bit better
 
01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
and and this bill has our current buffer
 
01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:33.750 align:start position:0%
and and this bill has our current buffer
law

01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:47:35.590 --> 01:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
has the flexibility that responds to the
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
01:47:39.590 --> 01:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's a flexible bill flexible law as it
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
is in existence right now
 
01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
it's certainly distinguishable from
 
01:47:46.149 --> 01:47:46.159 align:start position:0%
the mccullen case which is what the
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
current bill relies on
 
01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
and yesterday we heard the governor even
 
01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
talk about how the new hampshire way of
 
01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
responding flexibly
 
01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
to certain elements is an important
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
value that we cherish here in new
 
01:48:00.070 --> 01:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire and the current law does that
 
01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:01.350 align:start position:0%
hampshire and the current law does that
um

01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
and i also think that through the
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
testimony we also heard some pretty
 
01:48:06.629 --> 01:48:06.639 align:start position:0%
compelling testimony from
 
01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
the doctors who
 
01:48:13.030 --> 01:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:14.310 --> 01:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
folks who are on the sidewalks are
 
01:48:16.229 --> 01:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
saying to them as they enter
 
01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
a facility and
 
01:48:21.669 --> 01:48:21.679 align:start position:0%
that doctor tollen in particular had
 
01:48:24.149 --> 01:48:24.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned that in her view
 
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
all the women that had entered
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
facilities had gone through
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
different levels of analysis about what
 
01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
has to be
 
01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
a weighty decision
 
01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
and in fact
 
01:48:38.950 --> 01:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
more disturbing to them was
 
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
after having gone through that
 
01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
they entered the facility
 
01:48:44.709 --> 01:48:44.719 align:start position:0%
almost traumatized i believe she used
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
that word
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
so they had thought about that decision
 
01:48:53.590 --> 01:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
but in some i think
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
like i said before
 
01:48:57.669 --> 01:48:57.679 align:start position:0%
this bill our current law
 
01:49:00.229 --> 01:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
is flexible it responds to mccallen it
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
was crafted with the notice of what the
 
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
supreme court had said
 
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
about the massachusetts law
 
01:49:09.030 --> 01:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
and for those reasons i think it is it
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
is what we've heard about as a new
 
01:49:13.270 --> 01:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire way we're doing things
 
01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
that are flexible and that makes sense
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
that's why i urge folks to itl the
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
current bill
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
representative mclean thank you mr chair
 
01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:24.709 align:start position:0%
representative mclean thank you mr chair
um

01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
as as you wrap mentioned uh
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
representative paige d
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
the the right to free speech is not
 
01:49:32.159 --> 01:49:33.270 align:start position:0%
the the right to free speech is not
completely

01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
completely
 
01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:34.629 align:start position:0%
completely
um

01:49:34.629 --> 01:49:34.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:34.639 --> 01:49:35.910 align:start position:0%
um
unlimited

01:49:35.910 --> 01:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
unlimited
 
01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:36.870 align:start position:0%
unlimited
but

01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:49:40.390 --> 01:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
if you are going to place restrictions
 
01:49:44.310 --> 01:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
on free speech then you really have to
 
01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
demonstrate a compelling need to do so
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
there has to be
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
a really good reason and in
 
01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:53.350 align:start position:0%
a really good reason and in
the

01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
years i think it was 2014 since this law
 
01:49:59.669 --> 01:49:59.679 align:start position:0%
was enacted
 
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:03.679 align:start position:0%
a dozen clinics i believe from the
 
01:50:03.679 --> 01:50:05.189 align:start position:0%
a dozen clinics i believe from the
testimony

01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
in this state that provide abortion
 
01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:08.950 align:start position:0%
in this state that provide abortion
services

01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
yet in all that time
 
01:50:13.589 --> 01:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
they have never
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
taken advantage
 
01:50:18.149 --> 01:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
of this statute and you know i've been
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
in the committee long enough
 
01:50:23.189 --> 01:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
to see people from various
 
01:50:25.589 --> 01:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
reproductive health centers come in and
 
01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
i would ask them the question in fact
 
01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
last year you may recall there was a 72
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
year old woman
 
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
who testified that she would be an
 
01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:36.639 align:start position:0%
escort which would she would escort the
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
woman into the clinic and she was saying
 
01:50:41.589 --> 01:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
oh it's terrible the amount of abuse i
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
get and there's people over in in the
 
01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
other buildings and they're filming and
 
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
things like that so i asked
 
01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:49.270 align:start position:0%
things like that so i asked
the

01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
the manager of that clinic
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
why in this situation she hadn't take
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
advantage of the very powerful
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
provisions of this law and you know she
 
01:51:01.030 --> 01:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
says well we're still working out
 
01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:02.629 align:start position:0%
says well we're still working out
something

01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
with the with the local police and
 
01:51:07.669 --> 01:51:07.679 align:start position:0%
to this day there still has
 
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
nothing been enacted so i would argue
 
01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:12.310 align:start position:0%
nothing been enacted so i would argue
that

01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
the compelling need
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
in order to put these restrictions on
 
01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:18.149 align:start position:0%
in order to put these restrictions on
speech

01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
speech
 
01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
just has not been uh demonstrated and so
 
01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
based on that i'm going to support the
 
01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
bill thank you

mean i know this bill isn't going to
 
01:51:41.669 --> 01:51:41.679 align:start position:0%
pass but um we did um remove
 
01:51:43.990 --> 01:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
a law that that was not enforced that
 
01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:44.870 align:start position:0%
a law that that was not enforced that
was

01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:51:46.229 --> 01:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
used to be illegal to warm up your car
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
in the morning and we argued like well
 
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
if you have a baby don't you want to
 
01:51:51.990 --> 01:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
warm up the car in the morning
 
01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
you know you're not supposed to put the
 
01:51:54.629 --> 01:51:54.639 align:start position:0%
jackets on
 
01:51:57.430 --> 01:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
on the baby but that's another issue but
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
we did repeal that because it didn't
 
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
make any sense it wasn't enforced so
 
01:52:04.149 --> 01:52:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:09.750 --> 01:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
represented kenny
 
01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you mr chairman um so i i
 
01:52:14.470 --> 01:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
fully understand that it has not been
 
01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:15.830 align:start position:0%
fully understand that it has not been
used

01:52:15.830 --> 01:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
used
 
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
but attacks are on the rise across the
 
01:52:21.910 --> 01:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
country human nature is human nature and
 
01:52:23.589 --> 01:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is not immune to that
 
01:52:25.669 --> 01:52:25.679 align:start position:0%
potential and it's a tool
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
in the toolbox that if it is ever needed
 
01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
it's there um
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
if you own a house and it hasn't caught
 
01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
fire in six years you don't throw out a
 
01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
fire extinguisher just because you
 
01:52:38.550 --> 01:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
haven't used it yet you'll be very happy
 
01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
it's there
 
01:52:42.070 --> 01:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
if a fire does come and
 
01:52:43.669 --> 01:52:43.679 align:start position:0%
i believe that
 
01:52:46.149 --> 01:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
having that in the toolbox is only going
 
01:52:47.910 --> 01:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
to be useful if we ever
 
01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:49.679 align:start position:0%
have situation where granite staters
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
need to be protected despite uh what
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
your beliefs are on reproductive justice
 
01:52:57.750 --> 01:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with that has to do
 
01:53:00.149 --> 01:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
with keeping granite staters safe if
 
01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
other representative horrigan
 
01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i was
 
01:53:11.189 --> 01:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
a member of the committee when we
 
01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
passed when we passed this bill through
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
committee and um we did
 
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
well i was part of a small group i
 
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
didn't i was
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
my contribution was fairly small i would
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
give a special uh especially the line
 
01:53:24.790 --> 01:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
share credit to representative birch who
 
01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
i hope is recovering well and i hope is
 
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
possibly watching us on youtube but we
 
01:53:31.109 --> 01:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
were very as reverend page correctly
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
said we were very well aware of the uh
 
01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
what was going on with the massachusetts
 
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
law and uh we tried to tailor it to uh
 
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
meet the objections that the uh
 
01:53:42.790 --> 01:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
that the uh that have been uh that the
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
mass that had overturned the
 
01:53:45.589 --> 01:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
massachusetts law with the mccullen
 
01:53:48.070 --> 01:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
versus coakley supreme court case so we
 
01:53:50.709 --> 01:53:50.719 align:start position:0%
were well aware of that so we were uh
 
01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
we did make a lot of
 
01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
tweaks me not me so much mostly paul and
 
01:53:56.950 --> 01:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
some others who worked on it but i was i
 
01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
was part of the subcommittee but and um
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
other thing is we
 
01:54:04.709 --> 01:54:04.719 align:start position:0%
um there's certainly a right for them to
 
01:54:07.350 --> 01:54:07.360 align:start position:0%
express their opinion um but
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
you aren't necessarily allowed to
 
01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639 align:start position:0%
express your opinion exactly where you
 
01:54:13.510 --> 01:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
want to and certainly if you're blocking
 
01:54:16.070 --> 01:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
the the entrance to a
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
healthcare facility whether it's because
 
01:54:19.030 --> 01:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
you're opposed to abortion or vaccines
 
01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
or anywhere else that's uh not a
 
01:54:23.589 --> 01:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
constitutional right there you do it
 
01:54:25.270 --> 01:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
and so there's no constitutional rights
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
to harass or impede and
 
01:54:29.350 --> 01:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
also it's often representing that's
 
01:54:32.070 --> 01:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
providing counseling to the potential
 
01:54:33.350 --> 01:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
patients who are
 
01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
coming to the clinic and there's also no
 
01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
no right to provide for unlicensed
 
01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
counselors to uh operate on the sidewalk
 
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
and um there's
 
01:54:45.990 --> 01:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
certainly a lot of questions about uh
 
01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
how well how well they're trained
 
01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:49.350 align:start position:0%
how well how well they're trained
whether

01:54:49.350 --> 01:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
sir i know the escorts by the way have a
 
01:54:53.830 --> 01:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
pretty extensive training program and
 
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
they're you know they respect uh you
 
01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:56.870 align:start position:0%
they're you know they respect uh you
know

01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
they protect the patient's privacy
 
01:54:59.669 --> 01:54:59.679 align:start position:0%
rights and so forth so they have a
 
01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
pretty extensive
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
program it's really unclear
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
what the counselors are but in any case
 
01:55:06.310 --> 01:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
there is no legal or constitutional
 
01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
right to provide unlicensed counseling
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
services on the sidewalk
 
01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:12.790 align:start position:0%
services on the sidewalk
so

01:55:12.790 --> 01:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
01:55:15.669 --> 01:55:15.679 align:start position:0%
that's just a couple perspective i want
 
01:55:17.430 --> 01:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
to add a couple more reasons why we
 
01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:18.629 align:start position:0%
to add a couple more reasons why we
should

01:55:18.629 --> 01:55:18.639 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:55:20.709 --> 01:55:20.719 align:start position:0%
keep the law in place and and kill this
 
01:55:23.589 --> 01:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:32.790 --> 01:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
actually representative sylvia
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i'm reminded
 
01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
by the gentleman from durham
 
01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:39.990 align:start position:0%
by the gentleman from durham
that

01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:55:41.350 --> 01:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
and keeping it in play the the law and
 
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
keeping it in place
 
01:55:49.669 --> 01:55:49.679 align:start position:0%
keeps the people divided
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
it keeps people from being close enough
 
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
to talk to each other and have a civil
 
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.070 align:start position:0%
to talk to each other and have a civil
conversation

01:55:56.070 --> 01:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:55:57.189 --> 01:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
and i'd rather have the civil
 
01:55:57.199 --> 01:55:58.310 align:start position:0%
and i'd rather have the civil
conversation

01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative wilbur
 
01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman first i'd like
 
01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:12.709 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:56:12.709 --> 01:56:12.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
representative from durham said there's
 
01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:15.430 align:start position:0%
representative from durham said there's
no

01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
um law
 
01:56:21.589 --> 01:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
protecting unlicensed counseling
 
01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
on the street
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
which is quite true
 
01:56:30.629 --> 01:56:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:32.709 --> 01:56:32.719 align:start position:0%
levels of counseling
 
01:56:32.719 --> 01:56:34.229 align:start position:0%
levels of counseling
counsel

01:56:34.229 --> 01:56:34.239 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
01:56:36.790 --> 01:56:36.800 align:start position:0%
is what's used for giving advice
 
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
which is more along the lines of what
 
01:56:41.109 --> 01:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
the people
 
01:56:43.510 --> 01:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
who are outside the clinic do
 
01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
than anything else
 
01:56:48.310 --> 01:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
they inform and advise
 
01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:49.430 align:start position:0%
they inform and advise
women

01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
women
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
and encourage them to take advantage of
 
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
the options
 
01:56:59.830 --> 01:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
available to them
 
01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:01.350 align:start position:0%
available to them
but

01:57:01.350 --> 01:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
and the supreme
 
01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
when we talk about freedom of speech and
 
01:57:07.990 --> 01:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
when it can be curtailed
 
01:57:09.589 --> 01:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
there are certain attributes the supreme
 
01:57:11.990 --> 01:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
court uses to make these decisions
 
01:57:13.589 --> 01:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
and one of them is
 
01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
is the speech
 
01:57:17.669 --> 01:57:17.679 align:start position:0%
being curtailed
 
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
content neutral or is the curtailment
 
01:57:23.109 --> 01:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
content specific
 
01:57:25.350 --> 01:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
and if it's content specific
 
01:57:27.589 --> 01:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
that's not really an allowable reason
 
01:57:30.070 --> 01:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
for curtailing speech
 
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
in this option situation the speech is
 
01:57:35.830 --> 01:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
at 100 percent content specific if they
 
01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
don't care if you want to go out and
 
01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
various civil rights or
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
who won the football game on the
 
01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
sidewalk that's just fine you could
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
stand out there and it wouldn't be a
 
01:57:45.119 --> 01:57:46.709 align:start position:0%
stand out there and it wouldn't be a
problem

01:57:46.709 --> 01:57:46.719 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:57:49.030 --> 01:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
it's because
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
the speech that they're trying to
 
01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:51.990 align:start position:0%
the speech that they're trying to
prohibit

01:57:51.990 --> 01:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
prohibit
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
would take away their customers
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
so this law provides
 
01:57:57.440 --> 01:57:58.790 align:start position:0%
so this law provides
protection

01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
protection
 
01:58:01.589 --> 01:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
for the private businesses
 
01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
that are in the business of killing
 
01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:05.109 align:start position:0%
that are in the business of killing
babies

01:58:05.109 --> 01:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
babies
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
that that's not tolerable to me
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
so i would vote against it
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:18.629 --> 01:58:18.639 align:start position:0%
representative kenny
 
01:58:20.149 --> 01:58:20.159 align:start position:0%
ah yeah thank you um i just want to
 
01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:22.639 align:start position:0%
respond um to the civil
 
01:58:24.149 --> 01:58:24.159 align:start position:0%
conversations because it is a great
 
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
sentiment um but that is not every
 
01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:27.270 align:start position:0%
sentiment um but that is not every
person

01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
there uh some do want to pray i do know
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
we got testimonies with people with good
 
01:58:35.189 --> 01:58:35.199 align:start position:0%
intentions um but it's it's a distance
 
01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
of two parking spaces and if somebody
 
01:58:41.430 --> 01:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
wants to engage and seek advice
 
01:58:43.589 --> 01:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
the civil conversation can happen
 
01:58:43.599 --> 01:58:44.470 align:start position:0%
the civil conversation can happen
but

01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
everyone is not civil um
 
01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
that that is just a fact and i believe
 
01:58:52.070 --> 01:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
two parking spaces
 
01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
allows freedom of speech to still
 
01:58:57.589 --> 01:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
be totally present and allows someone to
 
01:58:59.830 --> 01:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
go to a medical procedure without being
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
harassed um
 
01:59:04.629 --> 01:59:04.639 align:start position:0%
because it does happen and
 
01:59:06.629 --> 01:59:06.639 align:start position:0%
we will be happy to have this tool in
 
01:59:09.589 --> 01:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
the toolbox if it's needed thank you
 
01:59:09.599 --> 01:59:13.189 align:start position:0%
the toolbox if it's needed thank you
representation

01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:15.430 --> 01:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
i was going to say about the same thing
 
01:59:17.589 --> 01:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
that what we're talking about is getting
 
01:59:19.830 --> 01:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
in someone's face and telling them
 
01:59:25.350 --> 01:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:27.589 --> 01:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
01:59:31.189 --> 01:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
thank you i think in this day and age
 
01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:32.719 align:start position:0%
women are
 
01:59:34.950 --> 01:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
aware of what their choices are i'm not
 
01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
saying they may be
 
01:59:38.870 --> 01:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
in depth of the
 
01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
amount of knowledgement but but you know
 
01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
you can
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
put a baby up for adoption you know you
 
01:59:47.109 --> 01:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
can go through with a pregnancy and you
 
01:59:50.390 --> 01:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
can also have the option of not having a
 
01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
pregnancy for the reasons that you have
 
01:59:55.109 --> 01:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
personally decided and talked to with
 
01:59:57.270 --> 01:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
the people you love
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
02:00:01.109 --> 02:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
unders i understand the praying i don't
 
02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
know how many people are really
 
02:00:07.109 --> 02:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
taken by listening to someone saying no
 
02:00:09.270 --> 02:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
come over here and talk to us about it i
 
02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
know there are people that are on the
 
02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
fence absolutely hundred percent it's a
 
02:00:13.750 --> 02:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
terrible thing
 
02:00:15.430 --> 02:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
when you have to face it no matter what
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
it's not a pleasant
 
02:00:20.550 --> 02:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
a present procedure it's not something
 
02:00:23.830 --> 02:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
that doesn't affect your life it does
 
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
but i don't
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
feel that
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
the being yelled at or being um even i
 
02:00:31.109 --> 02:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
don't know maybe i don't want to sit and
 
02:00:31.119 --> 02:00:32.149 align:start position:0%
don't know maybe i don't want to sit and
pray

02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
pray
 
02:00:34.149 --> 02:00:34.159 align:start position:0%
that's my personal choice it's your
 
02:00:36.709 --> 02:00:36.719 align:start position:0%
personal choice just to be there if i
 
02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
needed help or guidance i can come over
 
02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know i don't is is the concept
 
02:00:46.870 --> 02:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
that you that
 
02:00:49.910 --> 02:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
pro-life people think that the um
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
people who are having abortions the
 
02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
women don't understand there i'm asking
 
02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
a question to you don't understand what
 
02:01:00.790 --> 02:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
their options are what
 
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:06.229 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
would you volunteer to address that
 
02:01:10.629 --> 02:01:10.639 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question i'm really
 
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
glad you asked it
 
02:01:15.510 --> 02:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
because first of all you need to speak
 
02:01:17.109 --> 02:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
into your microphone because first of
 
02:01:17.119 --> 02:01:20.790 align:start position:0%
into your microphone because first of
all

02:01:20.790 --> 02:01:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:23.589 --> 02:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
post-aborted women
 
02:01:26.790 --> 02:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
by an enormous majority
 
02:01:29.669 --> 02:01:29.679 align:start position:0%
report that if they had had any support
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
at all
 
02:01:34.390 --> 02:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
they would not have done their abortions
 
02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:35.270 align:start position:0%
they would not have done their abortions
so

02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:01:37.109 --> 02:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
one of the things
 
02:01:38.709 --> 02:01:38.719 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:01:41.189 --> 02:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
counselors on the sidewalk do is they
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
inform women that there is support for
 
02:01:45.910 --> 02:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
them that they did not know existed
 
02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:47.669 align:start position:0%
them that they did not know existed
before

02:01:47.669 --> 02:01:47.679 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:49.679 align:start position:0%
that's one of the biggest reasons that
 
02:01:52.390 --> 02:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
they save substantial number of lives
 
02:01:54.390 --> 02:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
every single year
 
02:01:57.430 --> 02:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
because they just offer help and support
 
02:02:01.669 --> 02:02:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:04.470 --> 02:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative smith
 
02:02:06.790 --> 02:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i've
 
02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
sat here and listened
 
02:02:13.030 --> 02:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
to deeply held views
 
02:02:15.990 --> 02:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
that are disparate one from another and
 
02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
i know in this committee we have
 
02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:20.470 align:start position:0%
i know in this committee we have
respected

02:02:20.470 --> 02:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
respected
 
02:02:23.350 --> 02:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
those views and we respect each other
 
02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:24.709 align:start position:0%
those views and we respect each other
and

02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:26.950 --> 02:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
i chose not to add
 
02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
to the conversation
 
02:02:33.669 --> 02:02:33.679 align:start position:0%
but i do have to respond to what my
 
02:02:38.470 --> 02:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:42.310 --> 02:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
i have said before and i will say again
 
02:02:45.350 --> 02:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
that each of us is entitled to our own
 
02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:46.950 align:start position:0%
that each of us is entitled to our own
opinion

02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
02:02:48.790 --> 02:02:48.800 align:start position:0%
we are not
 
02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:50.229 align:start position:0%
we are not
entitled

02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
entitled
 
02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
to our own facts
 
02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
and i would suggest
 
02:02:57.270 --> 02:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
to the distinguished clerk of this
 
02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:58.310 align:start position:0%
to the distinguished clerk of this
committee

02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:03:01.750 --> 02:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
that the statement that he just made
 
02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:02.709 align:start position:0%
that the statement that he just made
is

02:03:02.709 --> 02:03:02.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:03:02.719 --> 02:03:04.310 align:start position:0%
is
not

02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
accurate it is not verifiable and it
 
02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't do credit to him
 
02:03:13.589 --> 02:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
when he makes such
 
02:03:13.599 --> 02:03:14.790 align:start position:0%
when he makes such
moving

02:03:14.790 --> 02:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
moving
 
02:03:17.109 --> 02:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
personal statements
 
02:03:17.119 --> 02:03:18.950 align:start position:0%
personal statements
without

02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:03:23.170 --> 02:03:23.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:23.180 --> 02:03:25.270 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:03:25.270 --> 02:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:03:27.589 --> 02:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
statements that are not
 
02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
verifiable and i would hope that each
 
02:03:31.750 --> 02:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
one of us
 
02:03:34.229 --> 02:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
would refrain from that
 
02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
there is nothing that any one of us on
 
02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
this committee in this legislature in
 
02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%
this state or country or world can do
 
02:03:47.030 --> 02:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
to end abortions
 
02:03:50.109 --> 02:03:50.119 align:start position:0%
abortions have existed as long as
 
02:03:50.119 --> 02:03:51.830 align:start position:0%
abortions have existed as long as
procreation

02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
procreation
 
02:03:53.910 --> 02:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
has existed
 
02:03:57.510 --> 02:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
we are not going to end that we might by
 
02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
providing adequate
 
02:04:02.229 --> 02:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
education to our children about how to
 
02:04:05.589 --> 02:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
avoid getting pregnant when it's not
 
02:04:07.669 --> 02:04:07.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate for them
 
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
education would help it might help if we
 
02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:13.069 align:start position:0%
education would help it might help if we
had

02:04:13.069 --> 02:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
had
 
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
availability of contraception
 
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
to again prevent pregnancies when it is
 
02:04:24.310 --> 02:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
not wanted or appropriate all of those
 
02:04:27.030 --> 02:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
are probably more significant in
 
02:04:29.910 --> 02:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
avoiding abortion
 
02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:31.510 align:start position:0%
avoiding abortion
than

02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:04:35.589 --> 02:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
us believing that we can pass a law or a
 
02:04:38.229 --> 02:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
rule or make a decision that is going to
 
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
end abortion
 
02:04:41.669 --> 02:04:41.679 align:start position:0%
that is not
 
02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
going to happen
 
02:04:46.390 --> 02:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
and i would suggest
 
02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:47.750 align:start position:0%
and i would suggest
that

02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:04:50.629 --> 02:04:50.639 align:start position:0%
the differences in our views are valid
 
02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
and understandable
 
02:04:54.310 --> 02:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
but please
 
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
don't invent facts don't use statements
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
from one source or another that you
 
02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
yourself haven't verified
 
02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
i have mentioned before and i will
 
02:05:10.629 --> 02:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
mention again the very first year i
 
02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
served on this judiciary committee in
 
02:05:12.719 --> 02:05:14.870 align:start position:0%
served on this judiciary committee in
1997

02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
1997
 
02:05:19.030 --> 02:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
one of my colleagues who was then um a
 
02:05:22.310 --> 02:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
very young man who i think had just
 
02:05:23.830 --> 02:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
finished college or he might have been
 
02:05:25.589 --> 02:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
his senior year
 
02:05:28.390 --> 02:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
announced that women
 
02:05:30.310 --> 02:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
he said girls
 
02:05:34.550 --> 02:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
that girls get give up their um
 
02:05:36.709 --> 02:05:36.719 align:start position:0%
go to get an abortion because they can't
 
02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
fit into a prom dress
 
02:05:42.870 --> 02:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
and i asked him if he could please give
 
02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
me the names and addresses of those
 
02:05:48.069 --> 02:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
women because i would like to speak with
 
02:05:50.790 --> 02:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
them and of course he could not
 
02:05:53.189 --> 02:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
and i would suggest to you that your
 
02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
statement that says
 
02:05:59.350 --> 02:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
that most women who have had abortions
 
02:06:01.990 --> 02:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
regret that and had the abortion because
 
02:06:07.669 --> 02:06:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:10.470 --> 02:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
i'd suggest you that that is not
 
02:06:13.589 --> 02:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
factually accurate and i would hope that
 
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
you would try not to use those kinds of
 
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
of statements because i don't think it
 
02:06:22.069 --> 02:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
does credit to your deeply held views
 
02:06:25.109 --> 02:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
you have the opportunity to respond if
 
02:06:29.430 --> 02:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
you want okay
 
02:06:30.790 --> 02:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:06:36.310 --> 02:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
the only thing i'd uh say is that
 
02:06:41.109 --> 02:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
02:06:45.109 --> 02:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't support the bill and
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know i've given it quite a bit of
 
02:06:48.149 --> 02:06:48.159 align:start position:0%
thought because
 
02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
ultimately i
 
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
think that restrictions particularly in
 
02:06:55.270 --> 02:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
public places should not be something
 
02:06:57.189 --> 02:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
that should be taken lightly and we
 
02:07:00.149 --> 02:07:00.159 align:start position:0%
shouldn't engage in in general
 
02:07:03.270 --> 02:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
but we have and we do we impose a
 
02:07:06.629 --> 02:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
restriction for example on our as having
 
02:07:09.030 --> 02:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
been a town moderator for many years we
 
02:07:11.830 --> 02:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
impose a buffer zone on entering the
 
02:07:11.840 --> 02:07:13.830 align:start position:0%
impose a buffer zone on entering the
polls

02:07:13.830 --> 02:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
polls
 
02:07:15.910 --> 02:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
and we do that because there are people
 
02:07:18.149 --> 02:07:18.159 align:start position:0%
who are adamant about their particular
 
02:07:18.159 --> 02:07:19.270 align:start position:0%
who are adamant about their particular
positions

02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
positions
 
02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:21.510 align:start position:0%
positions
who

02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:24.069 align:start position:0%
who
who

02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:24.079 --> 02:07:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
who

02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:07:27.669 --> 02:07:27.679 align:start position:0%
would make an effort to encounter voters
 
02:07:29.109 --> 02:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
as they come to the polls and we've
 
02:07:30.870 --> 02:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
indicated that we don't feel that those
 
02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:32.149 align:start position:0%
indicated that we don't feel that those
voters

02:07:32.149 --> 02:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
voters
 
02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
should have to run a gauntlet in order
 
02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
to come to vote and exercise what they
 
02:07:37.990 --> 02:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
have a right to do
 
02:07:40.709 --> 02:07:40.719 align:start position:0%
and so it isn't as if we haven't in the
 
02:07:42.629 --> 02:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
past exercise buffer zones there are
 
02:07:44.229 --> 02:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
other buffer zones too which i don't
 
02:07:45.910 --> 02:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
need to go into a description
 
02:07:47.910 --> 02:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
but ultimately the question comes down
 
02:07:50.870 --> 02:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
to this and uh as as it does i think for
 
02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
me with all legislation because i
 
02:07:56.390 --> 02:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
skip buoy standard who is a electrician
 
02:07:58.229 --> 02:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
in my town he says ned please don't vote
 
02:08:01.510 --> 02:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:04.069 --> 02:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
until you figure out if it's really
 
02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
needed and
 
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:08:09.109 --> 02:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
i don't think this re
 
02:08:11.589 --> 02:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
is needed because i think it's working
 
02:08:12.950 --> 02:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
pretty well
 
02:08:15.189 --> 02:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
and when i listen to the testimony that
 
02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
we had over in representatives hall
 
02:08:19.430 --> 02:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
the question is what would people do
 
02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:20.550 align:start position:0%
the question is what would people do
differently

02:08:20.550 --> 02:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
differently
 
02:08:23.109 --> 02:08:23.119 align:start position:0%
than they're doing right now
 
02:08:26.629 --> 02:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
and i heard from a lot of very
 
02:08:31.109 --> 02:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
wonderful people who are out
 
02:08:31.119 --> 02:08:31.990 align:start position:0%
wonderful people who are out
in

02:08:31.990 --> 02:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:08:34.629 --> 02:08:34.639 align:start position:0%
in front of the facilities that we're
 
02:08:37.589 --> 02:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
discussing who are doing their very best
 
02:08:39.109 --> 02:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
to counsel people if they have the
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to communicate with people
 
02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
to do those things but the question is
 
02:08:46.069 --> 02:08:46.079 align:start position:0%
what would they do
 
02:08:46.079 --> 02:08:47.669 align:start position:0%
what would they do
differently

02:08:47.669 --> 02:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
differently
 
02:08:47.679 --> 02:08:48.790 align:start position:0%
differently
and

02:08:48.790 --> 02:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:08:50.550 --> 02:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that they would do anything
 
02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:51.830 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that they would do anything
differently

02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
differently
 
02:08:53.830 --> 02:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
i mean they're still going to be as from
 
02:08:56.310 --> 02:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
what i can see for the most part
 
02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:57.830 align:start position:0%
what i can see for the most part
courteous

02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
courteous
 
02:08:57.840 --> 02:08:58.709 align:start position:0%
courteous
people

02:08:58.709 --> 02:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
doing their job so
 
02:09:03.350 --> 02:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
long and the short is i think keeping a
 
02:09:05.109 --> 02:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
buffer to prevent
 
02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
unwanted communications makes sense to
 
02:09:09.270 --> 02:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
me and i'm going to
 
02:09:13.350 --> 02:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
vote against the bill itself and
 
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:18.550 --> 02:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative alexander um sorry mr
 
02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
chair one more thing um the question
 
02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
behind this is um
 
02:09:24.629 --> 02:09:24.639 align:start position:0%
proponents for the repeal of this buffer
 
02:09:26.950 --> 02:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
zone would say it's unconstitutional
 
02:09:29.109 --> 02:09:29.119 align:start position:0%
um advocates for the buffer zone would
 
02:09:32.709 --> 02:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
say we've never used it because for one
 
02:09:34.550 --> 02:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
reason or another
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
my question is is let's see if
 
02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
if it's used let's file a lawsuit and
 
02:09:41.189 --> 02:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
let's have the courts determine whether
 
02:09:43.030 --> 02:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
this is constitutional or not it's been
 
02:09:44.870 --> 02:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
struck down in other states so i would
 
02:09:47.589 --> 02:09:47.599 align:start position:0%
say like until the buffer zone is used
 
02:09:49.350 --> 02:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
there's really no need to repeal it at
 
02:09:53.990 --> 02:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:56.390 --> 02:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comments
 
02:09:59.510 --> 02:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
mr clerk you want to call the roll
 
02:10:02.709 --> 02:10:02.719 align:start position:0%

02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%

and do you want to address your
 
02:12:40.069 --> 02:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
amendment uh thank you mr chairman mr
 
02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
chairman the freedom life protection act
 
02:12:43.589 --> 02:12:43.599 align:start position:0%
has only been in effect for a couple of
 
02:12:45.990 --> 02:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
months but it's been under attack
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
ever since the day it passed or even
 
02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:49.030 align:start position:0%
ever since the day it passed or even
before

02:12:49.030 --> 02:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:12:50.709 --> 02:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
the major objection that's been
 
02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
expressed about this act is the
 
02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:00.069 align:start position:0%
 
abortions

02:13:00.069 --> 02:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
abortions
 
02:13:00.079 --> 02:13:01.189 align:start position:0%
abortions
but

02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:13:03.030 --> 02:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
even though the act is constructed in
 
02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
such a way that it looks like that
 
02:13:08.229 --> 02:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
it isn't it doesn't do that
 
02:13:09.990 --> 02:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
because the uh
 
02:13:12.310 --> 02:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
but in any event
 
02:13:15.030 --> 02:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
in order to obviate that objection
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
i offer this amendment
 
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
which specifically says in the same
 
02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:20.550 align:start position:0%
which specifically says in the same
paragraph

02:13:20.550 --> 02:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:22.310 align:start position:0%
paragraph
that

02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:23.510 align:start position:0%
that
imposes

02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
imposes
 
02:13:25.109 --> 02:13:25.119 align:start position:0%
the ultrasound
 
02:13:28.069 --> 02:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
this subdivision shall be construed
 
02:13:29.750 --> 02:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
to require the performance of an
 
02:13:33.030 --> 02:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
ultrasound only if the provider either
 
02:13:35.669 --> 02:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
knows that the fetus has a gestational
 
02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
age of 24 weeks or is conscious of a
 
02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
substantial risk that the fetus has a
 
02:13:46.790 --> 02:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:48.390 --> 02:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
to add to the compromise that the
 
02:13:50.709 --> 02:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
freedom life protection act already is
 
02:13:53.350 --> 02:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
this language clarifies that the major
 
02:13:55.589 --> 02:13:55.599 align:start position:0%
objection that's been expressed on
 
02:13:58.709 --> 02:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
ever since it passed
 
02:14:00.069 --> 02:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
isn't valid
 
02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:09.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:14:09.030 --> 02:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
so as i understand that this replaces
 
02:14:12.390 --> 02:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
the entire bill
 
02:14:13.990 --> 02:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
with the provision with regard to the
 
02:14:15.669 --> 02:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
ultrasound is that correct it does
 
02:14:17.189 --> 02:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
replace the entire bill with this
 
02:14:17.199 --> 02:14:18.390 align:start position:0%
replace the entire bill with this
provision

02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
provision
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:26.629 --> 02:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
representative alexander thank you mr

walper for bringing forward this
 
02:14:32.229 --> 02:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
amendment um this addresses um my major
 
02:14:34.629 --> 02:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
concern that i had um regarding the
 
02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
ultrasound mandate in september um i
 
02:14:39.030 --> 02:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
would say that this does goes a long way
 
02:14:41.910 --> 02:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
to clarify the mandate um it also set i
 
02:14:44.069 --> 02:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
mean it in ultrasound
 
02:14:46.310 --> 02:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
knowingly at least 24 weeks is not a
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
transvaginal ultrasound a standard
 
02:14:50.229 --> 02:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
medical procedure would be it would be a
 
02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
typical belly rub
 
02:14:54.629 --> 02:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
non-invasive i appreciate
 
02:14:56.229 --> 02:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
you bringing forward this amendment and
 
02:14:57.910 --> 02:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
it addresses concerns i think it helps
 
02:14:59.589 --> 02:14:59.599 align:start position:0%
clarify and strengthen
 
02:15:01.109 --> 02:15:01.119 align:start position:0%
the modest fetal life protection act
 
02:15:03.510 --> 02:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:08.709 --> 02:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:10.629 --> 02:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
i i just want to say i
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
i would not support the original bill
 
02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
which in effect repealed the fetal
 
02:15:19.030 --> 02:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
health protection act
 
02:15:22.069 --> 02:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
but i believe that that act is subject
 
02:15:22.079 --> 02:15:23.189 align:start position:0%
but i believe that that act is subject
to

02:15:23.189 --> 02:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
some qualification and this being one of
 
02:15:29.350 --> 02:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
them and would support your amendment
 
02:15:32.069 --> 02:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
but would support other qualifications
 
02:15:36.229 --> 02:15:36.239 align:start position:0%

02:17:41.429 --> 02:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
beginning first
 
02:17:43.669 --> 02:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
to say
 
02:17:46.150 --> 02:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
my heartfelt thank you
 
02:17:48.070 --> 02:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
to my colleague
 
02:17:50.549 --> 02:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
the clerk of this committee
 
02:17:53.110 --> 02:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
the clerk of the committee listened
 
02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:54.830 align:start position:0%
the clerk of the committee listened
carefully

02:17:54.830 --> 02:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
carefully
 
02:17:58.230 --> 02:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
to testimony
 
02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
that was difficult for all of us to sit
 
02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:02.790 align:start position:0%
that was difficult for all of us to sit
through

02:18:02.790 --> 02:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:03.990 align:start position:0%
through
and

02:18:03.990 --> 02:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:18:07.429 --> 02:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
he did hear
 
02:18:07.439 --> 02:18:08.230 align:start position:0%
he did hear
and

02:18:08.230 --> 02:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:17.110 --> 02:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
the perceived ambiguity in language
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
having to do
 
02:18:21.750 --> 02:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
with the ultrasound
 
02:18:23.589 --> 02:18:23.599 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
02:18:27.270 --> 02:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
that the language that was passed
 
02:18:30.070 --> 02:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
quite inappropriately and without any
 
02:18:33.750 --> 02:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
hearing and without any deliberation
 
02:18:36.870 --> 02:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
in the finance committee to add
 
02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:38.389 align:start position:0%
in the finance committee to add
inappropriate

02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
02:18:40.790 --> 02:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
to house bill 2 language that had
 
02:18:43.030 --> 02:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the budget
 
02:18:48.070 --> 02:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
that language was very vague and it was
 
02:18:50.549 --> 02:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
perfectly understandable
 
02:18:50.559 --> 02:18:51.509 align:start position:0%
perfectly understandable
that

02:18:51.509 --> 02:18:51.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:54.389 --> 02:18:54.399 align:start position:0%
reading that language would cause
 
02:18:56.629 --> 02:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
anyone to believe
 
02:19:01.030 --> 02:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
that an ultrasound examination including
 
02:19:05.589 --> 02:19:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:05.599 --> 02:19:06.709 align:start position:0%
 
ultrasound

02:19:06.709 --> 02:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
ultrasound
 
02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
was going to be required
 
02:19:13.190 --> 02:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
for anyone in this state
 
02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:14.549 align:start position:0%
for anyone in this state
undergoing

02:19:14.549 --> 02:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
undergoing
 
02:19:18.309 --> 02:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
a legal abortion remember none of this
 
02:19:20.389 --> 02:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
applies at all
 
02:19:26.309 --> 02:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:29.910 --> 02:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
in back alleys and my hope is that we do
 
02:19:35.669 --> 02:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
representative welper's
 
02:19:41.910 --> 02:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
suggestion was i thought appropriate
 
02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
and while left to my own device i might
 
02:19:48.630 --> 02:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
not include the 24 weeks
 
02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
the 24 week
 
02:19:55.590 --> 02:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
restriction is not
 
02:19:55.600 --> 02:19:59.349 align:start position:0%
restriction is not
unreasonable

02:19:59.349 --> 02:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:02.230 --> 02:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
want at least one and maybe all i don't
 
02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
know because i haven't done all the
 
02:20:08.070 --> 02:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
research but at least one of the
 
02:20:08.080 --> 02:20:10.309 align:start position:0%
research but at least one of the
major

02:20:10.309 --> 02:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
major
 
02:20:10.319 --> 02:20:11.590 align:start position:0%
major
legal

02:20:11.590 --> 02:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
legal
 
02:20:11.600 --> 02:20:13.110 align:start position:0%
legal

02:20:13.110 --> 02:20:13.120 align:start position:0%

02:20:14.950 --> 02:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
entities that
 
02:20:17.830 --> 02:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
provide a whole range of services only
 
02:20:19.750 --> 02:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
one of which
 
02:20:22.309 --> 02:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
is abortions
 
02:20:26.950 --> 02:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
they do not provide abortions after 16
 
02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:28.550 align:start position:0%
they do not provide abortions after 16
weeks

02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
02:20:30.469 --> 02:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
16 weeks is roughly
 
02:20:32.230 --> 02:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
four months
 
02:20:32.240 --> 02:20:33.110 align:start position:0%
four months
so

02:20:33.110 --> 02:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
certainly 24 weeks is not inappropriate
 
02:20:39.750 --> 02:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
and i thank
 
02:20:42.870 --> 02:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh the representative for his amendment
 
02:20:46.150 --> 02:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
i was very happy to be able to vote for
 
02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:48.389 align:start position:0%
i was very happy to be able to vote for
it

02:20:48.389 --> 02:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
but i see that as a floor not as a
 
02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
ceiling there are a couple of other
 
02:20:59.750 --> 02:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
items that were included in
 
02:21:01.670 --> 02:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
house bill 2
 
02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
that i also think
 
02:21:04.080 --> 02:21:05.030 align:start position:0%
that i also think
are

02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:21:07.429 --> 02:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
deserving of
 
02:21:07.439 --> 02:21:09.990 align:start position:0%
deserving of
elimination

02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
elimination
 
02:21:11.590 --> 02:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
they basically
 
02:21:13.590 --> 02:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
come down
 
02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:14.710 align:start position:0%
come down
generally

02:21:14.710 --> 02:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
generally
 
02:21:15.750 --> 02:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
to my
 
02:21:18.630 --> 02:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
consistently held belief
 
02:21:23.190 --> 02:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
that the legislature has no business
 
02:21:23.200 --> 02:21:23.910 align:start position:0%
that the legislature has no business
in

02:21:23.910 --> 02:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:21:26.950 --> 02:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
the doctor's office that these decisions
 
02:21:29.110 --> 02:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
should be made
 
02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:31.990 align:start position:0%
should be made
by

02:21:31.990 --> 02:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:34.230 --> 02:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
the woman and those people who she
 
02:21:36.790 --> 02:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
chooses to involve including her the
 
02:21:39.030 --> 02:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
medical professionals
 
02:21:41.750 --> 02:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
and her family her religious whomever
 
02:21:41.760 --> 02:21:43.830 align:start position:0%
and her family her religious whomever
else

02:21:43.830 --> 02:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
else
 
02:21:45.990 --> 02:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
but if in fact
 
02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:52.150 align:start position:0%
 
in

02:21:52.150 --> 02:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:21:55.349 --> 02:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
in these issues then i think we have to
 
02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
02:21:58.950 --> 02:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
that we recognize
 
02:22:01.190 --> 02:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
that we have to have
 
02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
some other
 
02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:04.309 align:start position:0%
some other
limits

02:22:04.309 --> 02:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
limits
 
02:22:05.590 --> 02:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
the first
 
02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:07.429 align:start position:0%
the first
change

02:22:07.429 --> 02:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:22:10.710 --> 02:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
that i want to include
 
02:22:13.510 --> 02:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
is one having to do with
 
02:22:13.520 --> 02:22:14.790 align:start position:0%
is one having to do with
fetal

02:22:14.790 --> 02:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
fetal
 
02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
anomalies incompatible
 
02:22:18.640 --> 02:22:19.670 align:start position:0%
anomalies incompatible
with

02:22:19.670 --> 02:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:22.710 align:start position:0%
with
life

02:22:22.710 --> 02:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:25.190 --> 02:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
and i believe
 
02:22:27.510 --> 02:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
that that is something
 
02:22:28.630 --> 02:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
that we
 
02:22:30.550 --> 02:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
should acknowledge
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
it happens it doesn't happen
 
02:22:37.110 --> 02:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
always it doesn't happen universally but
 
02:22:39.270 --> 02:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
when it does happen
 
02:22:44.550 --> 02:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
it is an incredibly painful circumstance
 
02:22:47.830 --> 02:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
and difficult
 
02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
new reality
 
02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
for someone who was pregnant and who has
 
02:22:54.070 --> 02:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
looked forward
 
02:22:57.190 --> 02:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
to having a baby and or everything that
 
02:22:59.349 --> 02:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
comes from that i of course know that
 
02:23:01.910 --> 02:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
the most important thing that comes from
 
02:23:05.429 --> 02:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
pregnancies and babies is that they grow
 
02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
up and they marry
 
02:23:09.670 --> 02:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
and they produce grandchildren and
 
02:23:11.349 --> 02:23:11.359 align:start position:0%
nothing is more important than
 
02:23:15.190 --> 02:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
grandchildren so i believe
 
02:23:17.750 --> 02:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
in those those pregnancies
 
02:23:19.990 --> 02:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
going on
 
02:23:24.230 --> 02:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
but sometimes there are fetal anomalies
 
02:23:26.550 --> 02:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
those are not something that the
 
02:23:29.830 --> 02:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
legislature can decide that is something
 
02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:30.790 align:start position:0%
legislature can decide that is something
that

02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:23:33.590 --> 02:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
a medical professional
 
02:23:36.710 --> 02:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
can decide with whatever additional
 
02:23:38.469 --> 02:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
help they need
 
02:23:38.479 --> 02:23:39.270 align:start position:0%
help they need
so

02:23:39.270 --> 02:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:43.030 --> 02:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
i would like to add and as is added in
 
02:23:44.790 --> 02:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
my amendment
 
02:23:48.950 --> 02:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
line 10 except in the cases
 
02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:50.630 align:start position:0%
line 10 except in the cases
of

02:23:50.630 --> 02:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:23:54.309 --> 02:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
a case of fetal anomalies incompatible
 
02:23:56.550 --> 02:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
with life
 
02:23:58.790 --> 02:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's one change
 
02:24:01.110 --> 02:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
the next change
 
02:24:05.429 --> 02:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
that i wanted to make was to include in
 
02:24:08.550 --> 02:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
line 29
 
02:24:11.270 --> 02:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
not just the life
 
02:24:11.280 --> 02:24:12.309 align:start position:0%
not just the life
of

02:24:12.309 --> 02:24:12.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:24:15.349 --> 02:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
of the the the
 
02:24:17.910 --> 02:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
pregnant uh woman
 
02:24:19.510 --> 02:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
but also
 
02:24:21.590 --> 02:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
her health
 
02:24:24.550 --> 02:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
so it reads the life or health of the
 
02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
pregnant woman whose life is endangered
 
02:24:29.349 --> 02:24:29.359 align:start position:0%
by and then go on
 
02:24:32.710 --> 02:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
and i think that health is is a very
 
02:24:34.710 --> 02:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
important addition
 
02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
and so there are
 
02:24:38.469 --> 02:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
two changes
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
that i want to make the next changes
 
02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
that i want to make
 
02:24:46.870 --> 02:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2
 
02:24:48.710 --> 02:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
where none of this belonged in the first
 
02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:49.590 align:start position:0%
where none of this belonged in the first
place

02:24:49.590 --> 02:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:24:51.510 --> 02:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
is to remove
 
02:24:54.469 --> 02:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
the criminal penalties
 
02:24:56.550 --> 02:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
against health care
 
02:24:59.510 --> 02:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
providers and the civil
 
02:25:02.389 --> 02:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
penalties against
 
02:25:04.389 --> 02:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
health care providers
 
02:25:06.630 --> 02:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
health care providers
 
02:25:09.190 --> 02:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
are licensed by the state
 
02:25:12.790 --> 02:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
there are standards that they must meet
 
02:25:15.110 --> 02:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
there are provisions
 
02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:15.990 align:start position:0%
there are provisions
um

02:25:15.990 --> 02:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
whether they're whether they're
 
02:25:21.429 --> 02:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
setting the bones in my arm or my leg or
 
02:25:22.830 --> 02:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
whether they're
 
02:25:28.070 --> 02:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
um their obstetricians are involved in
 
02:25:30.710 --> 02:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
gynecologists involved in
 
02:25:33.190 --> 02:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
delivering care for pregnant women
 
02:25:35.670 --> 02:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
we are talking about people where we
 
02:25:38.790 --> 02:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
recognize the obligation of the state
 
02:25:40.550 --> 02:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
to license
 
02:25:43.349 --> 02:25:43.359 align:start position:0%
and the opportunity of the public
 
02:25:47.110 --> 02:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
whether it be the patient or anyone else
 
02:25:48.790 --> 02:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
to question
 
02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:50.790 align:start position:0%
to question
the

02:25:50.790 --> 02:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:25:52.870 --> 02:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
the responsibility the decisions that
 
02:25:57.190 --> 02:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
are made all of that is already in law
 
02:25:59.030 --> 02:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
to add
 
02:26:01.990 --> 02:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties
 
02:26:07.030 --> 02:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
having to do with whether or not
 
02:26:09.590 --> 02:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
or having to do with how they they they
 
02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
function in cases uh dealing with
 
02:26:14.790 --> 02:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
pregnant women i think
 
02:26:18.469 --> 02:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
creates a chilling of a chilling
 
02:26:18.479 --> 02:26:20.150 align:start position:0%
creates a chilling of a chilling
environment

02:26:20.150 --> 02:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
environment
 
02:26:23.750 --> 02:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
we have enough problems in this state
 
02:26:26.150 --> 02:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
and we see it all over the state not
 
02:26:28.870 --> 02:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
only in rural areas but also in urban
 
02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:29.910 align:start position:0%
only in rural areas but also in urban
areas

02:26:29.910 --> 02:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
areas
 
02:26:31.910 --> 02:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
in attracting
 
02:26:35.590 --> 02:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
qualified trained licensed medical
 
02:26:39.910 --> 02:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
professionals to come and do their jobs
 
02:26:43.270 --> 02:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
and we expect to hold them accountable
 
02:26:46.150 --> 02:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
to the standards that exist
 
02:26:48.710 --> 02:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
in this state and i have no problem with
 
02:26:52.389 --> 02:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
that what i do have a problem with
 
02:26:54.150 --> 02:26:54.160 align:start position:0%
is creating
 
02:26:56.150 --> 02:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
the appearance
 
02:26:58.230 --> 02:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
that somehow
 
02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
how they perform
 
02:27:02.790 --> 02:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
in this area
 
02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:03.910 align:start position:0%
in this area
differs

02:27:03.910 --> 02:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
differs
 
02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
from the standards that they are
 
02:27:08.630 --> 02:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
expected to perform in every other area
 
02:27:12.070 --> 02:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
of how they deliver
 
02:27:15.590 --> 02:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
hell responsible reliable health care
 
02:27:17.429 --> 02:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
so i have
 
02:27:19.030 --> 02:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
in this amendment
 
02:27:21.230 --> 02:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
done just those things i have
 
02:27:23.349 --> 02:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
enthusiastically added
 
02:27:27.110 --> 02:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative welfare's uh 24-week
 
02:27:27.120 --> 02:27:28.870 align:start position:0%
representative welfare's uh 24-week
limitation

02:27:28.870 --> 02:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
limitation
 
02:27:31.990 --> 02:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
including the possibility
 
02:27:34.389 --> 02:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
of um
 
02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
of an ultrasound if that is necessary to
 
02:27:39.349 --> 02:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
determine the 24 weeks
 
02:27:43.030 --> 02:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
but i have added fetal anomalies
 
02:27:47.510 --> 02:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:50.070 --> 02:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
not just a fetal anomaly but a fetal
 
02:27:53.270 --> 02:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
anomaly incompatible with life
 
02:27:55.030 --> 02:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
to this
 
02:27:55.040 --> 02:27:55.830 align:start position:0%
to this
um

02:27:55.830 --> 02:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:59.110 --> 02:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
i have added the health of the mother
 
02:28:01.030 --> 02:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
and i have said
 
02:28:05.110 --> 02:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
let's not arbitrarily put in here
 
02:28:07.349 --> 02:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
a restriction and i'm going to stop now
 
02:28:09.670 --> 02:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
because i saw
 
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:28:13.270 --> 02:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
chairs body language and he wants me to
 
02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:16.870 align:start position:0%
chairs body language and he wants me to
stop

02:28:16.870 --> 02:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:19.030 --> 02:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
and i almost always not always but i
 
02:28:21.030 --> 02:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
almost always do what the chair wants me
 
02:28:22.469 --> 02:28:22.479 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:28:24.870 --> 02:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
representative maclean
 
02:28:27.270 --> 02:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i just had a
 
02:28:28.870 --> 02:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
question for representative smith if
 
02:28:31.750 --> 02:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's okay of course okay well thank
 
02:28:33.349 --> 02:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
you representative smith for taking my
 
02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
question so i think fetal anomalies
 
02:28:38.630 --> 02:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life in my mind
 
02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
is something pretty well defined and i
 
02:28:42.710 --> 02:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
can kind of get my head around it but
 
02:28:44.469 --> 02:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
you also add
 
02:28:47.830 --> 02:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
an exception for health and
 
02:28:49.270 --> 02:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
health is
 
02:28:52.070 --> 02:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
not i think very well defined and and so
 
02:28:54.550 --> 02:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
because of that my concern is that it
 
02:28:56.790 --> 02:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
may erode some
 
02:28:59.510 --> 02:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
of the effectiveness of the bill so did
 
02:29:01.750 --> 02:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
you give any thought to maybe
 
02:29:04.389 --> 02:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
expanding the definition of health or
 
02:29:06.870 --> 02:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
are you aware of case law out there that
 
02:29:09.270 --> 02:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
basically has already kind of settled
 
02:29:11.429 --> 02:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
down on what that definition is thank
 
02:29:13.270 --> 02:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you i think it's a legitimate
 
02:29:15.590 --> 02:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
question if you look the sentence goes
 
02:29:18.870 --> 02:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
on it just it doesn't say
 
02:29:18.880 --> 02:29:20.070 align:start position:0%
on it just it doesn't say
um

02:29:20.070 --> 02:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:21.030 align:start position:0%
um
just

02:29:21.030 --> 02:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:29:23.429 --> 02:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
health you know which says you know then
 
02:29:26.630 --> 02:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
whose life is endangered by physical
 
02:29:29.030 --> 02:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
disorder physical illness or physical
 
02:29:29.040 --> 02:29:30.309 align:start position:0%
disorder physical illness or physical
injury

02:29:30.309 --> 02:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
injury
 
02:29:30.319 --> 02:29:31.590 align:start position:0%
injury
including

02:29:31.590 --> 02:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
including
 
02:29:34.230 --> 02:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
and then it it goes on
 
02:29:41.270 --> 02:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:43.349 align:start position:0%
 
narrows

02:29:43.349 --> 02:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
narrows
 
02:29:44.950 --> 02:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
narrows it down thank you very much
 
02:29:46.230 --> 02:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
representative representative mclean
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
you'd like to follow up thank you mr
 
02:29:51.750 --> 02:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
chair so um so in in your understanding
 
02:29:53.349 --> 02:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
then um
 
02:29:55.990 --> 02:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
by adding on some of the the follow-on
 
02:29:58.230 --> 02:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
definitions are in there let's say a
 
02:30:01.510 --> 02:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
woman was to get pregnant and as a as a
 
02:30:03.270 --> 02:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
result of that pregnancy and i'm not a
 
02:30:05.190 --> 02:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
doctor so maybe this happens or doesn't
 
02:30:06.790 --> 02:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
um she gets
 
02:30:09.110 --> 02:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
severe migraines you know but the
 
02:30:12.309 --> 02:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
thinking is that maybe once we go past
 
02:30:15.030 --> 02:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
the pregnancy um those would not be a
 
02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
persistent thing not something that
 
02:30:18.710 --> 02:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
would not endure past a pregnancy would
 
02:30:20.710 --> 02:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
that be considered health or no that
 
02:30:23.110 --> 02:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
would be something that this would in
 
02:30:26.070 --> 02:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
your opinion not be covered
 
02:30:28.389 --> 02:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
fortunately it's not my opinion that
 
02:30:31.030 --> 02:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
matters because what i have stated all
 
02:30:34.950 --> 02:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
along is i am not a physician i am not a
 
02:30:37.910 --> 02:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
doctor i am not in that room
 
02:30:39.349 --> 02:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
with the patient
 
02:30:43.110 --> 02:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
and it would be a medical professional
 
02:30:44.830 --> 02:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
who could say
 
02:30:47.830 --> 02:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
situation x
 
02:30:50.150 --> 02:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
may or may not have been caused by the
 
02:30:53.110 --> 02:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
pregnancy but has been exacerbated
 
02:30:57.270 --> 02:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
exacerbated by the pregnancy cannot be
 
02:31:00.550 --> 02:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
cured or would not disappear unless the
 
02:31:03.349 --> 02:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
pregnancy ends and that to me is a
 
02:31:05.429 --> 02:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
decision that should be made
 
02:31:07.910 --> 02:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
by medical professionals not by
 
02:31:10.550 --> 02:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
legislators who have all kinds of skills
 
02:31:13.510 --> 02:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
but no skill in this
 
02:31:15.670 --> 02:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative notter
 
02:31:17.830 --> 02:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
one quick comment thank you mr speaker
 
02:31:20.630 --> 02:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um the abortionist promote
 
02:31:22.550 --> 02:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
it again
 
02:31:24.389 --> 02:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
the abortionists in new hampshire are
 
02:31:29.030 --> 02:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:31.030 --> 02:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comments
 
02:31:32.950 --> 02:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
 
02:31:32.960 --> 02:31:34.710 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
um

02:31:34.710 --> 02:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:36.469 --> 02:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
well i attempted to answer the question
 
02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
about abortion is being licensed but i
 
02:31:40.389 --> 02:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
guess i'll pass on passed on that one
 
02:31:41.830 --> 02:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
obviously it has to be done we're
 
02:31:43.270 --> 02:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
talking here about
 
02:31:45.590 --> 02:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
physicians who are licensed and um i
 
02:31:45.600 --> 02:31:46.950 align:start position:0%
physicians who are licensed and um i
suppose

02:31:46.950 --> 02:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
suppose
 
02:31:47.990 --> 02:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
i feel there's other medical
 
02:31:49.510 --> 02:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
professionals who might you might be
 
02:31:51.910 --> 02:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
performing anyways anyway but i was
 
02:31:54.630 --> 02:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
the we're coming we're adding the phrase
 
02:31:56.870 --> 02:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
or health to the
 
02:31:59.670 --> 02:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
paragraph sub paragraph three in line 28
 
02:32:01.750 --> 02:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
through line one of the of the first
 
02:32:03.910 --> 02:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
page in line to the second page and
 
02:32:03.920 --> 02:32:04.790 align:start position:0%
page in line to the second page and
there's

02:32:04.790 --> 02:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:32:06.790 --> 02:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
existing language that's not in boldface
 
02:32:08.389 --> 02:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
because it's been there all along for
 
02:32:10.469 --> 02:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
those two long months since the bill
 
02:32:12.070 --> 02:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
took effect which
 
02:32:13.590 --> 02:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
says uh when the continuation of
 
02:32:16.070 --> 02:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
pregnancy would create a serious risk of
 
02:32:18.070 --> 02:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
substantial and irreversible impairment
 
02:32:20.630 --> 02:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
of a major bodily function as defined in
 
02:32:23.429 --> 02:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
rsa 329 43
 
02:32:25.670 --> 02:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
roman roman numeral five and that's a
 
02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
fairly broad definition of uh
 
02:32:30.150 --> 02:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
that's a fairly broad definition of a
 
02:32:31.990 --> 02:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
major bodily function so pretty much any
 
02:32:33.910 --> 02:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
bodily function is defined as a bodily
 
02:32:36.790 --> 02:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:38.230 --> 02:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
because that's in the bill so there's
 
02:32:39.750 --> 02:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
already is uh
 
02:32:41.590 --> 02:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
protection here and this i believe is
 
02:32:42.790 --> 02:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
putting that phrasing is just
 
02:32:44.550 --> 02:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
strengthening strengthening it and there
 
02:32:45.910 --> 02:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
is uh you know
 
02:32:48.070 --> 02:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
we're already uh
 
02:32:50.309 --> 02:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
we're just we're not putting anything
 
02:32:51.510 --> 02:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
substantially new we're just
 
02:32:53.750 --> 02:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
strengthening what's already there and
 
02:32:53.760 --> 02:32:55.349 align:start position:0%
strengthening what's already there and
um

02:32:55.349 --> 02:32:55.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:57.349 --> 02:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:33:01.429 --> 02:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:01.439 --> 02:33:03.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:33:03.110 --> 02:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:33:03.120 --> 02:33:04.630 align:start position:0%
okay
yes

02:33:04.630 --> 02:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:33:06.389 --> 02:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr senator
 
02:33:06.399 --> 02:33:09.830 align:start position:0%
thank you mr senator
so

02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:11.670 --> 02:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
i want to start with this repealing of
 
02:33:11.680 --> 02:33:13.349 align:start position:0%
i want to start with this repealing of
penalties

02:33:13.349 --> 02:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
we talked earlier
 
02:33:17.270 --> 02:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
you need to talk into the microphone i
 
02:33:21.830 --> 02:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:23.590 --> 02:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
we've spoken quite a bit about today
 
02:33:26.309 --> 02:33:26.319 align:start position:0%
about the value of the life
 
02:33:27.990 --> 02:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
and when we talk about the penalties
 
02:33:31.750 --> 02:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
that are included in this bill
 
02:33:33.429 --> 02:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
that's why they're there
 
02:33:35.110 --> 02:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
because this is the only procedure we
 
02:33:36.070 --> 02:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
know of
 
02:33:37.590 --> 02:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
as far as i know it's the only one that
 
02:33:37.600 --> 02:33:38.870 align:start position:0%
as far as i know it's the only one that
exists

02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
exists
 
02:33:41.190 --> 02:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
where it involves the intentional
 
02:33:43.110 --> 02:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
killing of a human
 
02:33:47.190 --> 02:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
and in this case an intentional killing
 
02:33:48.870 --> 02:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
of a human baby that could easily
 
02:33:48.880 --> 02:33:51.910 align:start position:0%
of a human baby that could easily
survive

02:33:51.910 --> 02:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:53.750 --> 02:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
so there's that that
 
02:33:55.590 --> 02:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
so i don't see if we remove these
 
02:33:55.600 --> 02:33:57.030 align:start position:0%
so i don't see if we remove these
penalties

02:33:57.030 --> 02:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
02:33:58.790 --> 02:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
we're devaluing
 
02:34:00.630 --> 02:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
that human life
 
02:34:04.070 --> 02:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:08.309 align:start position:0%
 
objection

02:34:08.309 --> 02:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:08.319 --> 02:34:09.429 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:34:09.429 --> 02:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:34:11.510 --> 02:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
agree with
 
02:34:13.830 --> 02:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
the representative from durham that the
 
02:34:16.150 --> 02:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
qualifications following the words or
 
02:34:16.160 --> 02:34:17.270 align:start position:0%
qualifications following the words or
health

02:34:17.270 --> 02:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
health
 
02:34:19.990 --> 02:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
do does narrow
 
02:34:22.230 --> 02:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
that exception
 
02:34:23.910 --> 02:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think it now is it enough for
 
02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:25.510 align:start position:0%
i don't think it now is it enough for
myself

02:34:25.510 --> 02:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
myself
 
02:34:27.670 --> 02:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
to support the bill anyway but i have
 
02:34:30.389 --> 02:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
plenty of other reasons to not
 
02:34:31.670 --> 02:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
what i really want to talk about is
 
02:34:34.710 --> 02:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
fetal anomalies incompatible with life
 
02:34:36.309 --> 02:34:36.319 align:start position:0%
which i don't believe exist in today's
 
02:34:38.309 --> 02:34:38.319 align:start position:0%
medical technology
 
02:34:38.319 --> 02:34:39.830 align:start position:0%
medical technology
about

02:34:39.830 --> 02:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:34:43.270 --> 02:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
about four years ago maybe six years ago
 
02:34:45.030 --> 02:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
we had a bill similar to this in this
 
02:34:45.040 --> 02:34:46.070 align:start position:0%
we had a bill similar to this in this
committee

02:34:46.070 --> 02:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:34:48.389 --> 02:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
and we had a vice chair of that
 
02:34:48.399 --> 02:34:50.070 align:start position:0%
and we had a vice chair of that
committee

02:34:50.070 --> 02:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:34:51.830 --> 02:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
who was
 
02:34:54.550 --> 02:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
what i want to call it very diligently
 
02:34:56.830 --> 02:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to any exceptions at
 
02:35:00.630 --> 02:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
all and we spent quite a bit of time
 
02:35:03.510 --> 02:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:06.550 --> 02:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
fetal anomalies incompatible with life
 
02:35:08.150 --> 02:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
02:35:10.070 --> 02:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
the only one
 
02:35:13.270 --> 02:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
that could be identified
 
02:35:13.280 --> 02:35:14.309 align:start position:0%
that could be identified
was

02:35:14.309 --> 02:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:35:18.870 --> 02:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
twin to twin transfusion syndrome
 
02:35:20.790 --> 02:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
and the reason that no others could be
 
02:35:24.150 --> 02:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
identified is because other anomalies
 
02:35:26.469 --> 02:35:26.479 align:start position:0%
that we normally consider or did
 
02:35:29.190 --> 02:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
consider even at that time incompatible
 
02:35:32.630 --> 02:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
with life were being cured
 
02:35:35.510 --> 02:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
by the technology that we have today so
 
02:35:37.990 --> 02:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
today if you have
 
02:35:39.429 --> 02:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to try and even try
 
02:35:41.190 --> 02:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
and use the medical terms because i'm
 
02:35:42.389 --> 02:35:42.399 align:start position:0%
not that
 
02:35:43.910 --> 02:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
so if you have a baby who's getting
 
02:35:45.510 --> 02:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
fluid in the brain
 
02:35:47.270 --> 02:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
and it's swelling and it would kill the
 
02:35:49.590 --> 02:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
baby today they can go in and withdraw
 
02:35:51.349 --> 02:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
that fluid
 
02:35:53.990 --> 02:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
and that baby can proceed through its uh
 
02:35:56.550 --> 02:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
more normal course of pregnancy
 
02:35:58.230 --> 02:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
if you have a baby with an open brain
 
02:35:58.240 --> 02:35:59.670 align:start position:0%
if you have a baby with an open brain
stem

02:35:59.670 --> 02:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
stem
 
02:36:01.429 --> 02:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
they can go in they can take the womb
 
02:36:05.030 --> 02:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
out open the womb perform surgery
 
02:36:08.710 --> 02:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
on that baby and close those openings
 
02:36:12.150 --> 02:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:13.670 --> 02:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
i'll go back to twin to twin
 
02:36:17.030 --> 02:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
transfusions uh transfer syndrome
 
02:36:18.630 --> 02:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
for those that don't know that can that
 
02:36:20.389 --> 02:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
consists of when there are two babies in
 
02:36:23.190 --> 02:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
the womb
 
02:36:27.349 --> 02:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:28.870 --> 02:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
so one baby
 
02:36:31.030 --> 02:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
gets more one baby gets less that's just
 
02:36:35.510 --> 02:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:37.910 --> 02:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
and that would be fatal to the one that
 
02:36:40.150 --> 02:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
gets less blood
 
02:36:43.349 --> 02:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
except even at that time and this is
 
02:36:45.270 --> 02:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
several years ago
 
02:36:47.670 --> 02:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
at the cleveland clinic the survival
 
02:36:50.710 --> 02:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
rate of both babies
 
02:36:52.550 --> 02:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
was over twenty percent the survival
 
02:36:54.389 --> 02:36:54.399 align:start position:0%
rate of one
 
02:36:56.790 --> 02:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
was way over not eighty percent
 
02:36:58.309 --> 02:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
and i'm quite confident that they're
 
02:37:01.030 --> 02:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
telling their technology has improved in
 
02:37:03.110 --> 02:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
the years in between
 
02:37:04.870 --> 02:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
so i don't believe there's actually any
 
02:37:07.270 --> 02:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
fetal anomaly that's incompatible with
 
02:37:09.190 --> 02:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
life so i would ask the
 
02:37:13.349 --> 02:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
sponsor to identify one or two
 
02:37:15.349 --> 02:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and i would
 
02:37:20.469 --> 02:37:20.479 align:start position:0%
say if there is no fetal anomaly
 
02:37:22.630 --> 02:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
that what's the language incompatible
 
02:37:24.070 --> 02:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
with life
 
02:37:27.030 --> 02:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
then that language doesn't matter but
 
02:37:30.790 --> 02:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
since i have no way of knowing that
 
02:37:33.990 --> 02:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
because i am not a physician i am not a
 
02:37:36.389 --> 02:37:36.399 align:start position:0%
geneticist i am not
 
02:37:38.950 --> 02:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
technically uh
 
02:37:41.190 --> 02:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
skilled in any of those decisions i
 
02:37:41.200 --> 02:37:42.630 align:start position:0%
skilled in any of those decisions i
believe

02:37:42.630 --> 02:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
believe
 
02:37:42.640 --> 02:37:43.750 align:start position:0%
believe
that

02:37:43.750 --> 02:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:37:46.950 --> 02:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh that that should be left for medical
 
02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
professionals and i
 
02:37:53.270 --> 02:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
i do know
 
02:37:53.280 --> 02:37:54.790 align:start position:0%
i do know
um

02:37:54.790 --> 02:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:54.800 --> 02:37:56.550 align:start position:0%
um
that

02:37:56.550 --> 02:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:37:58.790 --> 02:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's where those decisions should be
 
02:38:00.790 --> 02:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
made if there if we have the most
 
02:38:02.630 --> 02:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
wonderful medical system and there's
 
02:38:04.550 --> 02:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
never an opportunity
 
02:38:06.630 --> 02:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
for a fetal anomaly that cannot be
 
02:38:09.349 --> 02:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
corrected so be it that's fine then
 
02:38:11.830 --> 02:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
nobody can fall under this but i think
 
02:38:14.550 --> 02:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's likely
 
02:38:14.560 --> 02:38:15.990 align:start position:0%
it's likely
representative

02:38:15.990 --> 02:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:38:19.190 --> 02:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
that there are fetal anomalies and i
 
02:38:20.790 --> 02:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
want to make sure
 
02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:21.670 align:start position:0%
want to make sure
that

02:38:21.670 --> 02:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:22.870 align:start position:0%
that
women

02:38:22.870 --> 02:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
women
 
02:38:25.190 --> 02:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
and their families are protected in that
 
02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:29.110 align:start position:0%
and their families are protected in that
situation

02:38:29.110 --> 02:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:31.990 --> 02:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
follow up so
 
02:38:33.510 --> 02:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
we already know that not all
 
02:38:35.590 --> 02:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
abortionists in our state
 
02:38:37.429 --> 02:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
are required to be licensed
 
02:38:40.309 --> 02:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
but even beyond that
 
02:38:40.319 --> 02:38:41.110 align:start position:0%
but even beyond that
if

02:38:41.110 --> 02:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that
 
02:38:47.110 --> 02:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
typical medical practice if if
 
02:38:49.590 --> 02:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
a doctor performs an operation and the
 
02:38:49.600 --> 02:38:52.150 align:start position:0%
a doctor performs an operation and the
patient

02:38:52.150 --> 02:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:54.710 --> 02:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
dies or there's death involved that
 
02:38:56.550 --> 02:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
there's another autopsy
 
02:38:58.870 --> 02:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
to determine if in fact the diagnosis
 
02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
was accurate what the what this what the
 
02:39:05.349 --> 02:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
doctor did was correct
 
02:39:07.429 --> 02:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
how do we know
 
02:39:09.030 --> 02:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
that anybody
 
02:39:10.950 --> 02:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
who wants to violate the 24-week
 
02:39:13.750 --> 02:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
abortion ban couldn't just claim
 
02:39:15.270 --> 02:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
that there was some fetal normally
 
02:39:17.190 --> 02:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life right and that
 
02:39:18.710 --> 02:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
that's what they're putting in if they
 
02:39:21.670 --> 02:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
don't normally incompatible with life
 
02:39:23.030 --> 02:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
how do we know that there actually is
 
02:39:24.550 --> 02:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
such a thing
 
02:39:27.030 --> 02:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
in the case
 
02:39:31.990 --> 02:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:34.950 --> 02:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
i guess i can't answer that question i'm
 
02:39:37.590 --> 02:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
not going to go through
 
02:39:40.309 --> 02:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
you know the looking glass with you and
 
02:39:42.790 --> 02:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
say what if what if what if
 
02:39:48.630 --> 02:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes things happen that not one of
 
02:39:52.870 --> 02:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
us would
 
02:39:55.990 --> 02:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
would tolerate or want or expect what
 
02:39:59.670 --> 02:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
we're doing here is trying to pass
 
02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable legislation
 
02:40:05.110 --> 02:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
that in fact
 
02:40:10.150 --> 02:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:12.469 --> 02:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
our commitment to
 
02:40:12.479 --> 02:40:13.750 align:start position:0%
our commitment to
law

02:40:13.750 --> 02:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:40:16.230 --> 02:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
to medical standards
 
02:40:18.630 --> 02:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
to all kinds of
 
02:40:22.469 --> 02:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
behavioral limitations and respects
 
02:40:26.230 --> 02:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:29.910 --> 02:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
faced with a difficult situation
 
02:40:32.630 --> 02:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
to get the best professional guidance
 
02:40:36.790 --> 02:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
she can in making a decision and i i you
 
02:40:36.800 --> 02:40:37.750 align:start position:0%
she can in making a decision and i i you
know

02:40:37.750 --> 02:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:40:39.670 --> 02:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
do i think someone might be outside
 
02:40:40.950 --> 02:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
there right now
 
02:40:43.190 --> 02:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
you know breaking into my car of course
 
02:40:45.670 --> 02:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
somebody might be can i control that
 
02:40:49.429 --> 02:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
well no but there are laws to make sure
 
02:40:52.150 --> 02:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
that if they're doing that
 
02:40:54.150 --> 02:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
and they get caught they can be held
 
02:40:56.870 --> 02:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
responsible and it's certainly the same
 
02:40:58.550 --> 02:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
thing holds true
 
02:41:00.950 --> 02:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
whether you're a bricklayer
 
02:41:04.710 --> 02:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
or an or an obstetrician or even a
 
02:41:06.630 --> 02:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
legislator no no that's not true we're
 
02:41:09.110 --> 02:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
exempt from so many things
 
02:41:11.030 --> 02:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
i think truthfully i'm not going to
 
02:41:13.750 --> 02:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
answer any other questions because i'm
 
02:41:17.030 --> 02:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
afraid that the chair is really going to
 
02:41:17.040 --> 02:41:17.910 align:start position:0%
afraid that the chair is really going to
get

02:41:17.910 --> 02:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
get
 
02:41:20.230 --> 02:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
annoyed with me and i would never want
 
02:41:21.990 --> 02:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
that to happen
 
02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:22.710 align:start position:0%
that to happen
so

02:41:22.710 --> 02:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:41:24.230 --> 02:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
last statement
 
02:41:25.910 --> 02:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative oprah you want to just
 
02:41:27.750 --> 02:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
follow up with the last statement what i
 
02:41:29.269 --> 02:41:29.279 align:start position:0%
get from that
 
02:41:31.269 --> 02:41:31.279 align:start position:0%
is that we have created an opportunity
 
02:41:31.279 --> 02:41:32.230 align:start position:0%
is that we have created an opportunity
here

02:41:32.230 --> 02:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
for anyone who so desires
 
02:41:37.030 --> 02:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
to violate this bill
 
02:41:38.870 --> 02:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
with no accountability
 
02:41:40.710 --> 02:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
because there's no check on whether or
 
02:41:42.469 --> 02:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
not the reason given
 
02:41:44.389 --> 02:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
is in fact true
 
02:41:46.630 --> 02:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
and no penalty
 
02:41:48.710 --> 02:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
even if it is true i mean even if it's
 
02:41:50.710 --> 02:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
not true
 
02:41:53.349 --> 02:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
which effectively makes this a
 
02:41:56.469 --> 02:41:56.479 align:start position:0%
useless piece of law
 
02:41:59.110 --> 02:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
so i'll be voting against the amendment
 
02:42:00.870 --> 02:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
i'm surprised to hear that
 
02:42:03.030 --> 02:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative we don't need to comment
 
02:42:05.670 --> 02:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
so representative macbeth
 
02:42:08.150 --> 02:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:42:10.550 --> 02:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm shocked at the statements that
 
02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
i've been hearing that a couple of my
 
02:42:15.830 --> 02:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
colleagues have made that there is the
 
02:42:18.550 --> 02:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
unauthorized unlicensed practice of
 
02:42:22.630 --> 02:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
medicine going on in new hampshire and i
 
02:42:24.070 --> 02:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if they're talking about
 
02:42:25.910 --> 02:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
the dispensing of a morning after pill
 
02:42:29.030 --> 02:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
by someone that it's not but to say that
 
02:42:31.269 --> 02:42:31.279 align:start position:0%
if that's occurring i think that that's
 
02:42:34.790 --> 02:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:37.030 --> 02:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
i mean if people are illegally
 
02:42:39.590 --> 02:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
practicing medicine i think that needs
 
02:42:41.670 --> 02:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
those colleagues should bring that
 
02:42:41.680 --> 02:42:42.710 align:start position:0%
those colleagues should bring that
forward

02:42:42.710 --> 02:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:44.150 align:start position:0%
forward
and

02:42:44.150 --> 02:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:42:46.550 --> 02:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
if not i that is really an outrageous
 
02:42:48.550 --> 02:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
claim and i'm concerned about the
 
02:42:50.150 --> 02:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
misinformation that people that might be
 
02:42:52.630 --> 02:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
hearing and listening to this
 
02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:54.469 align:start position:0%
hearing and listening to this
um

02:42:54.469 --> 02:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:54.479 --> 02:42:55.510 align:start position:0%
um
might

02:42:55.510 --> 02:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
might
 
02:42:57.910 --> 02:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
think about new hampshire and about
 
02:42:59.349 --> 02:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
our laws and the operation of this
 
02:43:01.190 --> 02:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
committee if that if those comments keep
 
02:43:02.550 --> 02:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
being made without
 
02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:03.349 align:start position:0%
being made without
being

02:43:03.349 --> 02:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:43:05.510 --> 02:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
challenged or asked
 
02:43:07.030 --> 02:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
you know at least some other time this
 
02:43:09.590 --> 02:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
might not be the right time but i i just
 
02:43:10.950 --> 02:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
think those are
 
02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:17.990 --> 02:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative army
 
02:43:20.710 --> 02:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you i think what
 
02:43:22.550 --> 02:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
your colleagues are saying
 
02:43:25.630 --> 02:43:25.640 align:start position:0%
is that they are not licensed
 
02:43:28.950 --> 02:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
specifically to do abortions but they
 
02:43:32.230 --> 02:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
are obstetrics and gynecology

they land
 
02:45:07.439 --> 02:45:08.309 align:start position:0%
they land
on

02:45:08.309 --> 02:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:45:10.710 --> 02:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
at the desks of the top
 
02:45:13.990 --> 02:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
ob gyn people in new hampshire which is
 
02:45:16.070 --> 02:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
what usually would happen
 
02:45:19.510 --> 02:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
when it's a major problem and urgent
 
02:45:22.630 --> 02:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
that doctor is faced with
 
02:45:25.910 --> 02:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
in some cases very rare cases but they
 
02:45:27.510 --> 02:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
are faced
 
02:45:29.590 --> 02:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
in their practice with
 
02:45:32.630 --> 02:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
am i going to allow this woman to die or
 
02:45:36.790 --> 02:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:36.800 --> 02:45:38.070 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:45:38.070 --> 02:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:45:42.389 --> 02:45:42.399 align:start position:0%
you try recruiting people to come
 
02:45:46.630 --> 02:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
and join the few ob gyn doctors we have
 
02:45:50.230 --> 02:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:54.790 --> 02:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:57.269 --> 02:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is making sure that
 
02:45:59.910 --> 02:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
women are not going to have adequate ob
 
02:46:02.389 --> 02:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
gyn care
 
02:46:06.070 --> 02:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
if we keep that on the books thank you
 
02:46:08.070 --> 02:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
representative notter
 
02:46:09.269 --> 02:46:09.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:46:12.309 --> 02:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
it is true that that in new hampshire
 
02:46:13.910 --> 02:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
there is no law that says that
 
02:46:15.910 --> 02:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
abortionist has to be licensed so maybe
 
02:46:18.389 --> 02:46:18.399 align:start position:0%
that somebody wants to put in a bill to
 
02:46:20.150 --> 02:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
to fix that to make sure that they're
 
02:46:24.230 --> 02:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
licensed um i my second question is for
 
02:46:26.710 --> 02:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
representative wolper is everything that
 
02:46:29.110 --> 02:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
you were describing uh like the worth of
 
02:46:31.190 --> 02:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
a person and what's an anomaly whatever
 
02:46:33.590 --> 02:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
does that fall under the category of
 
02:46:33.600 --> 02:46:39.670 align:start position:0%
does that fall under the category of
eugenics

02:46:39.670 --> 02:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:41.590 --> 02:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
well it kind of it does
 
02:46:43.269 --> 02:46:43.279 align:start position:0%
it could
 
02:46:46.150 --> 02:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
but in the context of this bill
 
02:46:48.389 --> 02:46:48.399 align:start position:0%
i don't believe it does
 
02:46:50.550 --> 02:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
unless you say that down syndrome which
 
02:46:52.950 --> 02:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
is trying to be was being more or less
 
02:46:54.950 --> 02:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
successfully eliminated in various
 
02:46:54.960 --> 02:46:56.230 align:start position:0%
successfully eliminated in various
countries

02:46:56.230 --> 02:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
countries
 
02:46:58.710 --> 02:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
by the process of abortion
 
02:47:01.349 --> 02:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh if you consider that to be um
 
02:47:03.110 --> 02:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
incompat and a fetal anomaly
 
02:47:05.750 --> 02:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life or
 
02:47:07.750 --> 02:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
for somehow other falling outside the
 
02:47:09.110 --> 02:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
scope of this
 
02:47:12.309 --> 02:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:13.990 --> 02:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:15.030 align:start position:0%
there you go
okay

02:47:15.030 --> 02:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:47:17.590 --> 02:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
other yeah representative horrigan
 
02:47:20.469 --> 02:47:20.479 align:start position:0%
yeah so well maybe i don't need to
 
02:47:22.309 --> 02:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
be just a horse but there are um i mean
 
02:47:24.550 --> 02:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
the law does apply to anyone
 
02:47:26.870 --> 02:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
who's uh providing who doesn't abortion
 
02:47:28.309 --> 02:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not they're a
 
02:47:30.630 --> 02:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
licensed uh healthcare professional but
 
02:47:32.710 --> 02:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
as others have pointed out
 
02:47:34.230 --> 02:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
you definitely do you need to be a
 
02:47:35.990 --> 02:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
licensed physician or an allied
 
02:47:38.469 --> 02:47:38.479 align:start position:0%
profession then you do need to be
 
02:47:41.190 --> 02:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
and um you do need to be uh certified so
 
02:47:43.269 --> 02:47:43.279 align:start position:0%
it is illegal to practice medicine
 
02:47:45.110 --> 02:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
without a license um
 
02:47:46.550 --> 02:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
the best i know and i don't if there
 
02:47:48.550 --> 02:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
isn't a pacific i'm pretty i'm pretty
 
02:47:49.990 --> 02:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
sure probably is correct that there is
 
02:47:51.269 --> 02:47:51.279 align:start position:0%
in the pacific
 
02:47:53.990 --> 02:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
chapter the rsas about uh abortions but
 
02:47:55.670 --> 02:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
um that would
 
02:48:00.469 --> 02:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:04.790 --> 02:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
oh was i going on too long and also uh
 
02:48:06.070 --> 02:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
02:48:07.429 --> 02:48:07.439 align:start position:0%
anyway they're
 
02:48:08.550 --> 02:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
neither the
 
02:48:10.550 --> 02:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
hospitals nor the smaller reproductive
 
02:48:12.710 --> 02:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
health sillies i quite i can be quite
 
02:48:14.630 --> 02:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
certain that none of them are
 
02:48:14.640 --> 02:48:15.510 align:start position:0%
certain that none of them are
having

02:48:15.510 --> 02:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
having
 
02:48:17.349 --> 02:48:17.359 align:start position:0%

02:48:19.830 --> 02:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
surgical services such as abortion or
 
02:48:21.510 --> 02:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
any services that they're all properly
 
02:48:24.150 --> 02:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
licensed and certified and it would be
 
02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:25.269 align:start position:0%
licensed and certified and it would be
cycle

02:48:25.269 --> 02:48:25.279 align:start position:0%

02:48:25.279 --> 02:48:27.030 align:start position:0%

okay

02:48:27.030 --> 02:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:48:28.070 --> 02:48:28.080 align:start position:0%

my majority of minority reports by next

wednesday if that would be okay if i

could get it by wednesday
 
02:52:27.670 --> 02:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
i had everybody do them very quickly the
 
02:52:29.030 --> 02:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
last time because i thought we'd get
 
02:52:30.870 --> 02:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
them all on the calendar and of course
 
02:52:33.590 --> 02:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
they didn't get in the calendar so
 
02:52:35.590 --> 02:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
but i think if i got them by wednesday
 
02:52:37.750 --> 02:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
we could have them done by and submitted
 
02:52:39.590 --> 02:52:39.600 align:start position:0%

02:52:41.110 --> 02:52:41.120 align:start position:0%
