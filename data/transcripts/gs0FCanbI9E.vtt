I'm sorry I cleared the uh work the work
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
you try
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
I'll just
 
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:22.150 align:start position:0%
 
chair

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
WR jeez I've got two buttons instead of
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
one to deal with here so um
 
00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
so this bill was um to allow uh families
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
to come to this state um for uh uh
 
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
health care for their transgender
 
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.150 align:start position:0%
health care for their transgender
child

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
and um to allow them to get care here
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
that they may not be able to get in
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
their own
 
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
to allow the the care provider to hold
 
00:13:03.189 --> 00:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
the the information of what care that
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
child receives uh and not uh send that
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
information across state
 
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
lines um the
 
00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
U the challenge I believe is what is
 
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:23.240 align:start position:0%
legally possible to help a family avoid
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
prosecution in the state that they have
 
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.030 align:start position:0%
prosecution in the state that they have
come

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
come
 
00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
from and I'm
 
00:13:31.949 --> 00:13:31.959 align:start position:0%
have believe we have some information in
 
00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
front of us that would help us clarify
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
what can't be done based on the US
 
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:41.720 align:start position:0%
Constitution and if uh representative
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
Lon would like to make us aware of that
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
information uh thank you madam chair um
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
one of the big things that that we have
 
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
within the US Constitution is how the
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
different states work together um in
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
article 4 section two um it states in
 
00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:00.279 align:start position:0%
the second Clause a person charged in
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
any state with treason felony or other
 
00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:04.839 align:start position:0%
crime who shall flee from Justice and be
 
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
found in another state shall on demand
 
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
of the executive authority of the state
 
00:14:10.829 --> 00:14:10.839 align:start position:0%
from which he fled be delivered up to be
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
removed to the state having jurisdiction
 
00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:14.959 align:start position:0%
of the crime uh the most important part
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
is looking to some of the case history
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
around this because in order for this to
 
00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:22.839 align:start position:0%
hold the crime needs to have occurred in
 
00:14:25.629 --> 00:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
the state who is requesting the person
 
00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:28.839 align:start position:0%
um having a crime exist when somebody
 
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
leaves that state and then try to reach
 
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
into that other state is one of those
 
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
areas where where those demands would
 
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
not be valid in the first place and we
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that by saying that
 
00:14:42.189 --> 00:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
we are not going to comply with other
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
states laws that also would impact if
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
there was something of referral or care
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
happening within another state um and
 
00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
that would only be subject to those who
 
00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
are actually in the property of that
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
state so this actually shows that the
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
providers in New Hampshire would not be
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
subject to those laws and would be
 
00:14:59.870 --> 00:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
something that should be vigorously
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
defended by the Attorney General because
 
00:15:04.509 --> 00:15:04.519 align:start position:0%
it would be improper for another state
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
to charge somebody in New Hampshire for
 
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
their actions in New Hampshire that
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
moves far beyond this relationship
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
between the
 
00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
states so and and I I I also want to say
 
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
that I absolutely understand um the
 
00:15:21.389 --> 00:15:21.399 align:start position:0%
intention behind this bill and the
 
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:23.240 align:start position:0%
necessity to make sure that people know
 
00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:25.959 align:start position:0%
that they're welcome uh my I do have
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
another question around this bill
 
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
because I'm not it sounds I'm not sure
 
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
if um transgender care is suffering the
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
same shortages and backlogs that are
 
00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
being experienced in other parts of
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
healthcare um are our kids here in New
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that have need for these
 
00:15:43.069 --> 00:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
Services um already able to get all the
 
00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:45.079 align:start position:0%
appointments that they need or is there
 
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
already more demand than they're able to
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
accommodate not sure if you know
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
that that's a good question um I know
 
00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
that at one time that was an issue um
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
the biggest issue that I've seen so far
 
00:16:06.309 --> 00:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
is what therapists will accept payment
 
00:16:06.319 --> 00:16:07.829 align:start position:0%
is what therapists will accept payment
from

00:16:07.829 --> 00:16:07.839 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um they may be willing to offer
 
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
their services but not for
 
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:19.480 align:start position:0%
free and um they need to get paid for
 
00:16:21.949 --> 00:16:21.959 align:start position:0%
what they would typically be paid for uh
 
00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
for taking care of any client so that's
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
that's an issue that's outside the scope
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
of of this but there are there are
 
00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:32.759 align:start position:0%
therapists there are therapists that can
 
00:16:36.309 --> 00:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
provide um the services right now it's
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
just making sure people can find
 
00:16:38.959 --> 00:16:41.550 align:start position:0%
just making sure people can find
them

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you I if if um this area of
 
00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
medicine is actually fully staffed and
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
fully fully uh meeting all of the
 
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
demands I hope that they can pass on how
 
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
they're doing so well with the rest of
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
the of the healthcare profession um my
 
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
other one concern about this is I
 
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
recognize that there's other states who
 
00:17:02.309 --> 00:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
have already had this um Sanctuary type
 
00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
policy for these procedures but several
 
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%
of those are ones who have large centers
 
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
of excellence for transgender care and
 
00:17:12.189 --> 00:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
um to me if I were to go out of state to
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
seek care for my child I would most
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
likely go to one of these areas with a
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
center of excellence regardless of what
 
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
treatment it's for so um I'm concerned
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
both about the impact on kids in New
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who need access to this care
 
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
and also whether that would have um a
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
family come here to New Hampshire when
 
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
they may be able to um get their medical
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
needs treated U more comprehensively in
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
another state simply because they have a
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
larger and more robust system um when
 
00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
you look to some of the websites that
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
talk about the provision of care in New
 
00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's a lot of referrals we
 
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
already do out of state to to um
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts because they do so
 
00:17:57.149 --> 00:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
much understood um there are there are a
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
few that offer similar a similar thing
 
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
um uh this bill was is brought forward
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
as to give another option for people to
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
come to our state uh and maybe um uh
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
encourage them if they would like to
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
stay in this state that's another member
 
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
of the of the
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
community um and that was that was part
 
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
of the impetus for introducing this bill
 
00:18:26.669 --> 00:18:26.679 align:start position:0%
is not to not to U um have them
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
questioned whether they would be
 
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
welcomed or not but provide be able to
 
00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
provide service especially that we do
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
have the facility and at Dartmouth
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock uh that can provide services
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
which it's not just in U Lebanon it's
 
00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
all they also offer some of their
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
services in
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh the are um yeah yeses
 
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
Missour yeah so we request requested
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
information and we haven't received what
 
00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
we requested yet from Dartmouth
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock in regards to that so that's a
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
of of a little bit of concern to me too
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
is that they're not getting
 
00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
us information that I believe is needed
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
for us to proceed did they I I don't
 
00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
know that we asked for that information
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
for this bill we did ask it for 619 yeah
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
I mean to me they kind there's kind of
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
some overlap in in some of the
 
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
information so I think what's helpful
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
information that we would receive about
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
that would also pertain to some pieces
 
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
of this my
 
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:39.640 align:start position:0%
opinion yes thank you and if I if I can
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
add to that so what Dartmouth Hitchcock
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be you know the best and
 
00:19:48.029 --> 00:19:48.039 align:start position:0%
they do the most um
 
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
complex um procedures that's offered for
 
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
this kind of care um talking about
 
00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
surgery and they also um you know will
 
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
prescribe puberty block loers and
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
hormones and they also have um
 
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
therapists who are specially trained in
 
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
this area um they're supposed to be in
 
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
the state one of the best but so far we
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
all we've received from them is a
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
cross-sectional survey on um you know uh
 
00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.750 align:start position:0%
cross-sectional survey on um you know uh
suicidality

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
suicidality
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
after um puberty blockers are initiated
 
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
and a study that has an N of
 
00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
104 and very disjointed and not specific
 
00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
they didn't send us anything robust and
 
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:33.640 align:start position:0%
if this is what the best care is basing
 
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
their um procedures and their policies
 
00:20:40.029 --> 00:20:40.039 align:start position:0%
on um I'm a little concerned and I don't
 
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
think that it's appropriate to entice
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
people to come here to find to get that
 
00:20:45.039 --> 00:20:46.149 align:start position:0%
people to come here to find to get that
service

00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
provided um if this is the evidence that
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
they're providing legislators for what
 
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.590 align:start position:0%
they're providing legislators for what
they're

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
doing well I'd have to agree I can't
 
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
deny that uh on the other hand uh they
 
00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:04.039 align:start position:0%
they they do exist and they do offer uh
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
high quality care to their patients um
 
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
whe they're providing us the information
 
00:21:14.269 --> 00:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
we need it's a whole another story so um
 
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
but uh uh this uh this legislation was
 
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
to least remove a barrier that uh I was
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
made aware of by physicians in this
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
state uh because they were they were
 
00:21:30.669 --> 00:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
challenged by uh the question of should
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
they release information outside the
 
00:21:38.669 --> 00:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
state that might uh cause um a problem
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
or or a problem for the the family um as
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
far as the information that's shared and
 
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
would that be a legal problem uh that
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
would cause um someone to be prosecuted
 
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
uh so they are concerned about releasing
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
that form of insul that form of
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
information um without essentially
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
without the approval of the the family
 
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:08.200 align:start position:0%
because it's going to a legal entity
 
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
um I've I did a quick look at the
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
information you provided here and it
 
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
talks about the physical individual but
 
00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
it doesn't talk about what information
 
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
can be shared across state lines and
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's part of what this this
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
bill is all about is the information
 
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
that could be shared if if a family and
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
a child comes to New Hampshire um so it
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
it comes down if if they're considering
 
00:22:40.149 --> 00:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
getting care in another state is to have
 
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire be one of those options
 
00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
and uh to make our uh medical people
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
aware that they don't necessarily have
 
00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:51.039 align:start position:0%
to share information to another state
 
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
that could be used to
 
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
prosecute a family uh and um that might
 
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
be an issue that a family is concerned
 
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
about but it also would allow that if a
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
family wants that information to be
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
option I have a question um I wrote it I
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
wrote this question down when we had our
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
very first hearing about this um that
 
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
what if one parent wants surgery for
 
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
their child and the other
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't how does that work and and that
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
would be beyond the scope of this bill
 
00:23:32.269 --> 00:23:32.279 align:start position:0%
and that that's something that would
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
have they would have to work that out in
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
court as far as is the is the parent um
 
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
does one parent have control over the
 
00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
health care of or if they're split up
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
right you know and then maybe maybe one
 
00:23:50.909 --> 00:23:50.919 align:start position:0%
lives in a different state and things
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
like that so there's a lot of nuances
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
that's that's a yeah an issue associated
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
with the divorce of that family yeah go
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
ahead Le then I have a follow up
 
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair um so I just
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
have another so to jump off what you
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
were saying about the information
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
gathering um I only see that um it
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
basically says that we can't our state
 
00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
will not honor foreign subpoenas for
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
information um from other states right
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
that's correct um so I think that's
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
where it drifts into the territory of
 
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
um that you know we are not to interfere
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
with that kind of um extradition whether
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's a person or information I think
 
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
that it
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
may kind of enter the area of
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
interfering with due process of people
 
00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
who are being prosecuted in those States
 
00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
because now they're not going to be able
 
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
our state is actively restricting their
 
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
ability to extract evidence and I
 
00:24:57.389 --> 00:24:57.399 align:start position:0%
understand that there's ideological
 
00:25:00.389 --> 00:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
opposition OPP to um another State's
 
00:25:03.149 --> 00:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
laws perhaps but
 
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
um that's why the different states have
 
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
um the ability to make the own their own
 
00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:13.799 align:start position:0%
laws that govern their own States and
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
um it's it just doesn't seem like this
 
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
is within our authority to
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
do yeah that was a question of mine has
 
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
um representative Canon has any
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
conversations been with the attorney
 
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
general about this especially
 
00:25:35.549 --> 00:25:35.559 align:start position:0%
constitutionally um from what what
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative Lon read
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
um it it seems clear to me about the
 
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of this but I don't
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
know if a con conversation has been had
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
with any higher ups in the AG's
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
office um we haven't contacted the
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
I'm looking
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
at yeah I guess for me it's the the
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
whole thing is the the overreach
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
States we can't override an other states
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the methodology note from
 
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.590 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the methodology note from
the

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:31.149 align:start position:0%
the
court

00:26:31.149 --> 00:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
um the Attorney General was not
 
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
specifically contacted by uh
 
00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.430 align:start position:0%
specifically contacted by uh
us

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
um I know that OS had this and believed
 
00:26:44.909 --> 00:26:44.919 align:start position:0%
that it could be enacted here that all
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
um so I think and and I was reading
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
through this this piece that
 
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
representative Lon provided and and I'm
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
looking at a bolded area says an accused
 
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
will however be discharged on habus
 
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
Corpus he shows by clear satisfactory
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
evidence that he was outside the
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
demanding State when the crime occurred
 
00:27:16.269 --> 00:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
the following sentence if however
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
evidence is conflicting hius Corpus is
 
00:27:20.909 --> 00:27:20.919 align:start position:0%
not the proper proceeding to try the
 
00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
question of an alibi
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.310 align:start position:0%
so I think
um

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
where similar bills have passed other uh
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies in other states they
 
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
would have the same issue and currently
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know of any court case against
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
this implementation in other states um I
 
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
would I would like to proceed to offer
 
00:27:52.389 --> 00:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
this as an option as as something that's
 
00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
that's there for our medical personnel
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
as far as the question goes of can I
 
00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
release should I release this
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
information knowing that by releasing it
 
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
I'm putting a family and a child at risk
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
in the state that they live in um it's
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
not necessarily requiring that the the
 
00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
state is asking I need this family to
 
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
come back to Texas for instance to be
 
00:28:23.509 --> 00:28:23.519 align:start position:0%
processed it's it it's the family went
 
00:28:26.269 --> 00:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire got some services
 
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
medical services went back to
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
Texas the question is then can Texas
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
prosecute that family for getting care
 
00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:40.120 align:start position:0%
in another state uh and
 
00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
and do we alleviate the question in the
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
minds of the medical people providing
 
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
that care because some sometimes it may
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
be should I even provide this care
 
00:28:54.029 --> 00:28:54.039 align:start position:0%
because there is the potential that the
 
00:28:57.509 --> 00:28:57.519 align:start position:0%
family could be end up in a legal
 
00:28:59.789 --> 00:28:59.799 align:start position:0%
situation with the state that they came
 
00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
from um so part of this is to put it in
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
our own statute that says no they can't
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
they can't be processed they can't be
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
prosecuted in another
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
state for just providing information or
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
that a family can't be prosecuted if
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
they've gotten s uh medical service here
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh and the information is provided by a
 
00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
medical Prof should not be provided by a
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
medical professional here it's in in
 
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
some ways it it goes beyond the scope of
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
HIPPA uh it's it's says that if they
 
00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:37.519 align:start position:0%
come to this state um the medical
 
00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:40.039 align:start position:0%
professional can keep that information
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:51.039 align:start position:0%
court yes represent just clarification
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
on um you know receiving gender
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
affirming Health Care you know or mental
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
health care so gender affirming Health
 
00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:02.519 align:start position:0%
Care is that inclusive then of
 
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
transition surgeries on
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
minors that that would be um as as a
 
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
part of the standards of care that a
 
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
child child at anyone is supposed to
 
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
have uh be involved working with a
 
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
therapist as well as with a psychologist
 
00:30:23.509 --> 00:30:23.519 align:start position:0%
right but so and what if though the
 
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
decision was made from a family out of
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
state they wanted their child to undergo
 
00:30:31.389 --> 00:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
um or the child wanted to go gender
 
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
reassignment surgery is that this bill
 
00:30:37.509 --> 00:30:37.519 align:start position:0%
would in like that would make that that
 
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
that would be a possib it comes down to
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
whatever Services we offer here in New
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are legal in New
 
00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it does not it does not say
 
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
that we could offer anything more yeah
 
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
and I guess that's my struggle because I
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
haven't heard a definite answer from
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock as to what exactly
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
they are providing right now actually on
 
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
their website they State they they do
 
00:31:05.549 --> 00:31:05.559 align:start position:0%
not provide gender um gender surgery to
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
those under the age of 18 they said that
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
on their website but when they were here
 
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
they they weren't able to uh she still
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
was not able to provide that Clarity and
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
even in the emails that we've sent we've
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
still got not gotten that definite
 
00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:24.919 align:start position:0%
answer so I'm just that's our the part I
 
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.039 align:start position:0%
struggle with this this
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
bill essentially it if a family comes
 
00:31:33.039 --> 00:31:34.870 align:start position:0%
bill essentially it if a family comes
here

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
for transgender care it's whatever the
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
legal definition is here it does not
 
00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:43.559 align:start position:0%
change our
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
statutes as as far as the services that
 
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
can be offered it does not give them any
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
additional benefit it would be the same
 
00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:54.559 align:start position:0%
medical services that we provide to
 
00:31:57.789 --> 00:31:57.799 align:start position:0%
transgender children here in in in New
 
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I um sorry I go
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
ahead my question would be about how
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
frequently um these these children are
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
meeting with the different providers how
 
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
often they're having these therapy
 
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
sessions and and Psychotherapy sessions
 
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
and how often they're doing this in
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
order to have that uh more rigorous
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
support that is provided for in the
 
00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
guidelin so that they are getting that
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
ongoing support through this whole
 
00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
transition process do you know how
 
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
frequently they would be meeting with
 
00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.629 align:start position:0%
frequently they would be meeting with
providers

00:32:29.629 --> 00:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
um in some cases it's it's every month
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
so then it would be up to the family if
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
they want to come here to New Hampshire
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
and make sure that they're here every
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
month and that would be their
 
00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
decision okay thank you that's pretty
 
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
helpful it seems that it would be it
 
00:32:46.909 --> 00:32:46.919 align:start position:0%
would be a really big challenge for a
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
family to maintain their residency in
 
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
another state when they're coming
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
monthly for care um and to me it almost
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
seems like a family in that situation i'
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
I've seen PL of families move for a
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
parents job or for another need moving
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
to another state for other types of
 
00:33:04.629 --> 00:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
medical care and actually making a move
 
00:33:06.269 --> 00:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
even if they do maintain their home and
 
00:33:09.629 --> 00:33:09.639 align:start position:0%
rent it to somebody in the interim um if
 
00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:11.799 align:start position:0%
somebody were to move from Texas to New
 
00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in order to get this care uh
 
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
that would be a matter of a state then
 
00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:17.720 align:start position:0%
interfering with somebody who is a
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
former resident of that state I know
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
that there's already been push back
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
against California trying to tax former
 
00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire former
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
residents of California
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
um after leaving the state and there's a
 
00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
large push back on that idea of of a
 
00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
state laying claim to somebody who once
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
lived in that state and so I guess I'm
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
I'm I appreciate the goal of trying to
 
00:33:42.269 --> 00:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
make sure that this is more welcoming
 
00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
for these kids and their families but
 
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm wondering if you know flying
 
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
back and forth monthly is even the best
 
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
provision of care especially because
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
very few of these states with these
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
rules even have direct flights to New
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I appreciate app being
 
00:33:58.909 --> 00:33:58.919 align:start position:0%
welcoming but I'm also looking at the
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
actual tactical e efforts of it I I
 
00:34:05.549 --> 00:34:05.559 align:start position:0%
understand the concern um but does that
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
go beyond the scope of our bill this
 
00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is just to put it in statute
 
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
that it's here especially to protect our
 
00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
medical professionals if a family
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
decides that they want to
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
um live here temporarily and can afford
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
their own situation to come up here and
 
00:34:27.149 --> 00:34:27.159 align:start position:0%
uh rent a piece of property and then
 
00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
it's the it's their decision to do that
 
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh and their decision is it as to what
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
um charges they might be facing in their
 
00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:41.079 align:start position:0%
own state so that's a family decision uh
 
00:34:44.829 --> 00:34:44.839 align:start position:0%
is to but to provide essentially provide
 
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
um especially for our own medical
 
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
professionals that they don't have to
 
00:34:50.829 --> 00:34:50.839 align:start position:0%
worry about the legal issues about
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
providing care it it then it comes down
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
to does a family want to fact in that
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
they would have to be here on a regular
 
00:35:01.829 --> 00:35:01.839 align:start position:0%
basis to provide that care that's a
 
00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
family decision not the state decision
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
the state here should be focused on and
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
the issue here is can we protect our
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
medical professionals that can they hold
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
on to the information if if if that
 
00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
information is requested from out of
 
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
state if a family decides that that to
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
get the care that they need they need to
 
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
work out the arrangements for uh how
 
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
they will do that um that's their
 
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility it's not the
 
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility in this
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
bill um that's that's beyond the scope
 
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I appreciate that my
 
00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
concern is just o over how practical of
 
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
an option this may be compared to the
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
cost um to the state to potentially
 
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
defend a a lawsuit against us if it is
 
00:35:51.069 --> 00:35:51.079 align:start position:0%
found to be unconstitutional um I
 
00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
recognize that um there may not be any
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
challenges to California's um statute on
 
00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.309 align:start position:0%
challenges to California's um statute on
this

00:35:57.309 --> 00:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:35:59.190 --> 00:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
but just because a suit hasn't been
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
brought about the constitutionality in
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
another state doesn't mean that uh
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that it won't be coming in
 
00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
the future and that could have a really
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
really hard large fiscal impact when
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
this is perhaps something that would be
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
better as a fine-tuned um approach to
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
the ultimate privacy of people's medical
 
00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
records and to better protect the
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
Privacy the the sharing of anybody's
 
00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
medical records and to just better
 
00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
enforce New Hampshire privacy laws
 
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
around medical privacy that are in
 
00:36:32.109 --> 00:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
excess of that of HIPPA which is allowed
 
00:36:33.309 --> 00:36:33.319 align:start position:0%
and I think that that might be a more
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
elegant solution that addresses both the
 
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
needs of this community and more broadly
 
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
addresses the needs of granite Staters
 
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
and um while I appreciate I I appreciate
 
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
everything behind this bill I
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
just it just doesn't seem to be the most
 
00:36:50.309 --> 00:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
effective use of resources in order to
 
00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
put out that welcome that that's that's
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
my large my largest concern is that
 
00:36:56.109 --> 00:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
there's so many challenges to it and I'm
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
not sure how effective it would be even
 
00:36:59.790 --> 00:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
if we did go through all of those steps
 
00:37:02.109 --> 00:37:02.119 align:start position:0%
put the state at risk in order to offer
 
00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
this when we may not be the destination
 
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
of choice anyways representative Canon
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
is is there any openness to um possibly
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
creating an interim study surrounding
 
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
this to so we can get
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
more information from Dartmouth
 
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.390 align:start position:0%
more information from Dartmouth
Hitchcock

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock
 
00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.990 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock
and

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
um cuz that's for me that's just this
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
this big question mark that with all the
 
00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
hearings we've had
 
00:37:35.309 --> 00:37:35.319 align:start position:0%
still has not made me feel comfortable
 
00:37:38.109 --> 00:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
with what I've heard would you like to
 
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
move that
 
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
that okay then um because a motion's
 
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
been made there is a second we have to
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
act on this on this motion so um I would
 
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
like to know uh how many are in favor
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
and how many are
 
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
not move
 
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:07.720 align:start position:0%
forward so we have three in favor and
 
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
one no so um so I believe that that's
 
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
going to be what we will recomm
 
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
recommend um to the full committee when
 
00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:19.990 align:start position:0%
recommend um to the full committee when
we

00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
meet thank you thank you I I think just
 
00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:25.240 align:start position:0%
we did have a or tried to have a hearing
 
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
on this previously and I it seems like
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
we've had you know we've presented our
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
our questions and everything about it
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
and with what's still um I would
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
actually love to hear from the AG too I
 
00:38:40.829 --> 00:38:40.839 align:start position:0%
I would I'd want to hear make sure we're
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
not crossing any constitutional
 
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
boundaries because I'm a big fan of that
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution I I will see what I can get
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
for an answer okay yeah no I this is I'd
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
like to dig into it more personally so
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so yeah there could be
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
overreach on this today and there could
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
be overreach on a different issue in the
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
future I think that it's important to
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
make sure we protect all of our citizens
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
and people who visit the state I just
 
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we do it in the right
 
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
way so thank you for bringing the bill
 
00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
it sounds good okay thank you all so
 
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
declared this work session over so then
 
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
after yes so this the this will be the
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee recommendation
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.400 --> 01:17:51.990 align:start position:0%
 
yourself

01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.000 --> 02:00:48.109 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:48.119 --> 03:07:49.190 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:07:49.190 --> 03:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:51.229 --> 03:07:51.239 align:start position:0%
um we are back together again and it's
 
03:07:52.870 --> 03:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh good to see a few more faces around
 
03:07:54.710 --> 03:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
this than we had this morning so that's
 
03:07:57.990 --> 03:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
very very good to see um I'd like to
 
03:07:59.990 --> 03:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
start discussing some of the issues
 
03:08:01.630 --> 03:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
around the conversion therapy and the
 
03:08:03.590 --> 03:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
discussions and some of the testimony
 
03:08:06.910 --> 03:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
that we heard um last last we met for
 
03:08:09.070 --> 03:08:09.080 align:start position:0%
the public hearing um there was
 
03:08:12.429 --> 03:08:12.439 align:start position:0%
testimony from uh Mr urel from glad
 
03:08:14.349 --> 03:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
where he stayed that gender identity was
 
03:08:18.070 --> 03:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
fixed um but unfortunately that is not
 
03:08:20.429 --> 03:08:20.439 align:start position:0%
consistent with the guidelines and
 
03:08:22.229 --> 03:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
information and the world Professional
 
03:08:24.389 --> 03:08:24.399 align:start position:0%
Association of transgender Health
 
03:08:27.269 --> 03:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
standard of care 8 guidelines I have
 
03:08:30.389 --> 03:08:30.399 align:start position:0%
provided a copy of seven pages from
 
03:08:32.750 --> 03:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
those guidelines it's what begins with
 
03:08:35.670 --> 03:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
the titling of chapter six
 
03:08:38.710 --> 03:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
adolescence so I will read you just a
 
03:08:40.910 --> 03:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
couple little dots um from here first
 
03:08:43.790 --> 03:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
off on this adolescence um the this
 
03:08:45.910 --> 03:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
chapter applies to adolescence from the
 
03:08:48.389 --> 03:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
start of puberty into the age of legal
 
03:08:51.309 --> 03:08:51.319 align:start position:0%
majority in most places that's 18 some
 
03:08:53.349 --> 03:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
countries it's 15 and some places it's
 
03:08:56.349 --> 03:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
as high as 21 years of age all of the W
 
03:08:59.190 --> 03:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
paath guidelines are all sensitive to
 
03:09:01.750 --> 03:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
whatever the legal realities are in the
 
03:09:03.429 --> 03:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
area of treatment and they provide great
 
03:09:06.670 --> 03:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
accommodation for that so speaking to
 
03:09:09.790 --> 03:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
the issue around gender identity and
 
03:09:12.590 --> 03:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
whether it is fixed from the start um
 
03:09:12.600 --> 03:09:13.710 align:start position:0%
whether it is fixed from the start um
initi

03:09:13.710 --> 03:09:13.720 align:start position:0%
initi
 
03:09:16.510 --> 03:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
when care was provided to adolescents
 
03:09:18.309 --> 03:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
they were those adolescents who had been
 
03:09:20.950 --> 03:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
clear and persistent from the time that
 
03:09:23.150 --> 03:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
they were first born uh or close to when
 
03:09:25.590 --> 03:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
they were first born and it was a very
 
03:09:28.110 --> 03:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
highly screened um group that did not
 
03:09:30.190 --> 03:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
include as many people as there are
 
03:09:33.990 --> 03:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
today um so if we look on the second
 
03:09:36.830 --> 03:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
page so it's s44 down to near the bottom
 
03:09:38.309 --> 03:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the second to last
 
03:09:41.990 --> 03:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph it states that um for some
 
03:09:43.830 --> 03:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
youth gender ident identity development
 
03:09:45.790 --> 03:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
appears fixed and is often expressed
 
03:09:47.710 --> 03:09:47.720 align:start position:0%
from a young age while for others there
 
03:09:49.510 --> 03:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
may be a developmental process that
 
03:09:52.429 --> 03:09:52.439 align:start position:0%
contributes to gender identity over time
 
03:09:54.229 --> 03:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
speaks to some studies and then flipping
 
03:09:56.070 --> 03:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
to the next page starting halfway
 
03:09:58.910 --> 03:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
through the fourth line it states it is
 
03:10:00.990 --> 03:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
important to note it is not possible to
 
03:10:02.950 --> 03:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
distinguish between those for whom
 
03:10:04.630 --> 03:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
gender identity may seem fixed from
 
03:10:07.070 --> 03:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
birth and those for whom gender identity
 
03:10:08.349 --> 03:10:08.359 align:start position:0%
development appears to be a
 
03:10:10.710 --> 03:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
developmental process since it is
 
03:10:13.150 --> 03:10:13.160 align:start position:0%
impossible to definitively delineate the
 
03:10:15.309 --> 03:10:15.319 align:start position:0%
contributions of various factors
 
03:10:16.910 --> 03:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
contributing to the gender identity
 
03:10:20.030 --> 03:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
development for any given young person a
 
03:10:21.710 --> 03:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
comprehensive clinical approach is
 
03:10:23.790 --> 03:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
important and necessary and then
 
03:10:26.389 --> 03:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
continues conceptualization of gender
 
03:10:29.510 --> 03:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
identity by shifting from dichotomus for
 
03:10:32.150 --> 03:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
example binary categorization of male
 
03:10:34.510 --> 03:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
and female to a dimensional gender
 
03:10:36.870 --> 03:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
Spectrum along a Continuum would also be
 
03:10:40.550 --> 03:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
necessary to better understand this um
 
03:10:42.229 --> 03:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
later on the page it notes that one
 
03:10:43.830 --> 03:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
trend ident identified as that more
 
03:10:45.590 --> 03:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
young people are presenting to gender
 
03:10:48.269 --> 03:10:48.279 align:start position:0%
clinics with non-binary
 
03:10:50.910 --> 03:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
identities on the very last page has the
 
03:10:52.590 --> 03:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
summary of the statement of
 
03:10:55.190 --> 03:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
recommendations for adolescence and if
 
03:10:57.229 --> 03:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
you look at
 
03:11:01.030 --> 03:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
6.2 it states we recommend healthc Care
 
03:11:02.910 --> 03:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
Professionals working with gender
 
03:11:05.670 --> 03:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
diverse adolescents facilitate the
 
03:11:08.710 --> 03:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
exploration and expression of gender
 
03:11:11.590 --> 03:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
openly and respectfully so that no one
 
03:11:14.429 --> 03:11:14.439 align:start position:0%
particular identity is favored that is
 
03:11:16.750 --> 03:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
in essence what we tried to do when we
 
03:11:19.070 --> 03:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
were looking to amend the statute on
 
03:11:21.910 --> 03:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy nobody wants to force
 
03:11:24.070 --> 03:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
a child to be somebody that they aren't
 
03:11:25.510 --> 03:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
but the current language is not
 
03:11:27.030 --> 03:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
accommodating to the current state of
 
03:11:31.229 --> 03:11:31.239 align:start position:0%
knowledge around the um around how
 
03:11:33.790 --> 03:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
gender identity is formed and it's also
 
03:11:35.990 --> 03:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
not consistent with the w paath
 
03:11:38.870 --> 03:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines um we we can figure out if we
 
03:11:41.630 --> 03:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
do want to pursue um making any of these
 
03:11:43.550 --> 03:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
changes to conversion th therapy or if
 
03:11:45.510 --> 03:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
we would save that for um some other
 
03:11:47.229 --> 03:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
time when we can bring in some experts I
 
03:11:49.070 --> 03:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
think that might be better because
 
03:11:50.750 --> 03:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
there's so many people just seeing these
 
03:11:53.070 --> 03:11:53.080 align:start position:0%
headlines and not understanding the real
 
03:11:54.950 --> 03:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
true work we're trying to do here to
 
03:11:57.030 --> 03:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that nonb binary individuals
 
03:11:58.830 --> 03:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
are respected as well I don't know if
 
03:12:00.389 --> 03:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
there's any thoughts about whether we
 
03:12:02.469 --> 03:12:02.479 align:start position:0%
should um whether we should proceed
 
03:12:03.990 --> 03:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
looking at this or if that's something
 
03:12:07.269 --> 03:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
that we should not do at this point I
 
03:12:10.870 --> 03:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
think we should not do at all or right
 
03:12:15.429 --> 03:12:15.439 align:start position:0%
now uh at all the uh people who um
 
03:12:17.950 --> 03:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
testified uh the other week and then in
 
03:12:21.070 --> 03:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
the spring were happy with how the
 
03:12:24.269 --> 03:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy ban was worded and
 
03:12:26.190 --> 03:12:26.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to trust them on
 
03:12:30.389 --> 03:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
that representative Canon um I I agree I
 
03:12:30.399 --> 03:12:32.030 align:start position:0%
that representative Canon um I I agree I
don't

03:12:32.030 --> 03:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
don't
 
03:12:35.590 --> 03:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
microphone I uh I agree with
 
03:12:38.030 --> 03:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative not up um that we
 
03:12:40.590 --> 03:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't address it here part of the
 
03:12:41.990 --> 03:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
reason is because we're having a
 
03:12:44.590 --> 03:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
dialogue about transgender
 
03:12:46.750 --> 03:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
individuals we're not having a
 
03:12:48.229 --> 03:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
discussion about
 
03:12:51.229 --> 03:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
lgbtq people in total and that's the
 
03:12:53.110 --> 03:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
problem here is that the what we're
 
03:12:55.830 --> 03:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
talking about is is transgender people
 
03:12:57.950 --> 03:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
and we haven't had in the the group of
 
03:12:59.710 --> 03:12:59.720 align:start position:0%
people that were speaking we didn't have
 
03:13:01.269 --> 03:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
the entire
 
03:13:01.279 --> 03:13:03.110 align:start position:0%
the entire
lgbtq

03:13:03.110 --> 03:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
lgbtq
 
03:13:06.349 --> 03:13:06.359 align:start position:0%
population sharing and that's why in the
 
03:13:08.750 --> 03:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
past when this when conversion of
 
03:13:11.269 --> 03:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
therapy has come up as a separate bill
 
03:13:13.309 --> 03:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
that we had an entire community of
 
03:13:15.950 --> 03:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
people addressing all areas of that
 
03:13:17.469 --> 03:13:17.479 align:start position:0%
could be affected by it conversion
 
03:13:19.229 --> 03:13:19.239 align:start position:0%
therapy would
 
03:13:22.349 --> 03:13:22.359 align:start position:0%
impact G and lesbian people as well as
 
03:13:25.030 --> 03:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
transgender people and as such I don't
 
03:13:28.030 --> 03:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
believe that we can do it justice in
 
03:13:31.309 --> 03:13:31.319 align:start position:0%
this bill um thank you for that um I I
 
03:13:32.510 --> 03:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
think that we had had that one
 
03:13:34.550 --> 03:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
clarification on the wording but the
 
03:13:37.150 --> 03:13:37.160 align:start position:0%
larger point is that um I I frankly
 
03:13:39.030 --> 03:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
don't believe that non-binary people are
 
03:13:40.870 --> 03:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
appropriately protected within that
 
03:13:42.990 --> 03:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy statute but I think
 
03:13:45.990 --> 03:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
we can leave that to another time um and
 
03:13:49.870 --> 03:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
focus on Purely the genital gender
 
03:13:53.510 --> 03:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
reassignment surgeries for minors
 
03:13:57.710 --> 03:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
um so there's a whole Paradigm of care
 
03:14:00.870 --> 03:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
that is outlined quite well in the wp
 
03:14:03.590 --> 03:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
standard of care 8 um going back to this
 
03:14:05.870 --> 03:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
first page it speaks about the um
 
03:14:08.389 --> 03:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria being imp
 
03:14:10.229 --> 03:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
persistent long history of gender
 
03:14:12.990 --> 03:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
non-conformity or dysphoria emerging or
 
03:14:16.269 --> 03:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
intensifying the Onsen of puberty uh in
 
03:14:18.750 --> 03:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
particular it also speaks to the absence
 
03:14:21.150 --> 03:14:21.160 align:start position:0%
or management of psychological medical
 
03:14:23.190 --> 03:14:23.200 align:start position:0%
or social problems that interfere with
 
03:14:26.429 --> 03:14:26.439 align:start position:0%
treatment um I'm I'm very concerned um
 
03:14:29.990 --> 03:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
with the idea that um that there's so
 
03:14:32.670 --> 03:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
much of a focus on any one treatment
 
03:14:34.870 --> 03:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
that um dealing with the larger scope
 
03:14:37.030 --> 03:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
and and and reasons around suicidal
 
03:14:39.750 --> 03:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
ideology is being pushed away with the
 
03:14:41.710 --> 03:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
idea that the surgery will fix
 
03:14:43.150 --> 03:14:43.160 align:start position:0%
everything and I'm afraid that that's a
 
03:14:45.870 --> 03:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
very dangerous thought um it also speaks
 
03:14:47.990 --> 03:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
about needing the support of people
 
03:14:49.630 --> 03:14:49.640 align:start position:0%
around and most importantly the
 
03:14:55.990 --> 03:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:56.000 --> 03:14:58.790 align:start position:0%
 
consent

03:14:58.790 --> 03:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
consent
 
03:15:01.790 --> 03:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
um I did want to make note that I had
 
03:15:03.790 --> 03:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
made the point about the the fact that
 
03:15:05.670 --> 03:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
when you're a teenager it feels like
 
03:15:07.269 --> 03:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
everything needs to happen right away or
 
03:15:09.710 --> 03:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
else it'll never happen and that was put
 
03:15:11.349 --> 03:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
a lot more elegantly in the standard of
 
03:15:13.670 --> 03:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
care here saying that adolescence often
 
03:15:16.389 --> 03:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
experience a sense of urgency that stems
 
03:15:18.750 --> 03:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
from hypers sensitivity to reward and
 
03:15:20.550 --> 03:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
their sense of timing has been shown to
 
03:15:22.110 --> 03:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
be different from that of older
 
03:15:24.110 --> 03:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
individuals um that sites a study the
 
03:15:26.630 --> 03:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
van lean horse at all from 2010 that's
 
03:15:28.630 --> 03:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
on the second page and I think that it's
 
03:15:31.189 --> 03:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
quite important to make sure that as we
 
03:15:32.630 --> 03:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
look at this we try and understand and
 
03:15:34.189 --> 03:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
balance their needs now and their
 
03:15:39.389 --> 03:15:39.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:43.070 --> 03:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
well so given the lifelong lications of
 
03:15:44.750 --> 03:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
medical treatment and the young age at
 
03:15:47.309 --> 03:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
which treatments may be started um
 
03:15:49.550 --> 03:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
adolescents their parents and care care
 
03:15:51.389 --> 03:15:51.399 align:start position:0%
providers should be informed about the
 
03:15:54.469 --> 03:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
nature of the evidence base um it seems
 
03:15:56.389 --> 03:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
that reasonable that decisions to move
 
03:15:58.590 --> 03:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
forward with surgical treatment should
 
03:16:01.150 --> 03:16:01.160 align:start position:0%
be made carefully and despite the slowly
 
03:16:03.110 --> 03:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
growing body of evidence supporting the
 
03:16:05.070 --> 03:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of early medical
 
03:16:07.110 --> 03:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
intervention the number of studies is
 
03:16:09.150 --> 03:16:09.160 align:start position:0%
still low and there are few outcome
 
03:16:12.070 --> 03:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
studies that follow youth into adulthood
 
03:16:14.389 --> 03:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
um and so the standard of care says that
 
03:16:16.670 --> 03:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
a systematic review regarding outcomes
 
03:16:18.550 --> 03:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
of treatment in adolescence is not
 
03:16:21.590 --> 03:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
possible that's both medical and
 
03:16:23.790 --> 03:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
surgical that's on the third P the
 
03:16:28.590 --> 03:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:31.229 --> 03:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
s46 the psychological function body
 
03:16:33.030 --> 03:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
image and treatment statisfaction when
 
03:16:34.990 --> 03:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
you look at a meta analysis of the data
 
03:16:36.950 --> 03:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
in here only followed up from 3 months
 
03:16:38.830 --> 03:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
to two years after the initiation of
 
03:16:40.710 --> 03:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
treatment when we're talking about
 
03:16:43.110 --> 03:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
surgical uh Surgical procedures we need
 
03:16:46.030 --> 03:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the safety and
 
03:16:48.110 --> 03:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
efficacy last longer than that you know
 
03:16:50.550 --> 03:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
I spoke before about uh comparing this
 
03:16:53.229 --> 03:16:53.239 align:start position:0%
to knee replacement surgery in knee
 
03:16:54.990 --> 03:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
Replacements when you have your first
 
03:16:57.030 --> 03:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
one um you you have a pretty good shot
 
03:16:58.550 --> 03:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
at it it's usually going to work pretty
 
03:17:00.790 --> 03:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
well but if it fails you need to remove
 
03:17:02.830 --> 03:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
more bone and then you have the revision
 
03:17:05.389 --> 03:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
one and that one might last 10 years
 
03:17:07.510 --> 03:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
might last 15 hopefully Orthopedics has
 
03:17:09.229 --> 03:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
improved since I I stopped paying as
 
03:17:11.150 --> 03:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
much attention to it but after that and
 
03:17:13.189 --> 03:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
you're in a wheelchair and that's just
 
03:17:16.189 --> 03:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
your knee if you're talking about um
 
03:17:18.510 --> 03:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
these surgeries we don't know what the
 
03:17:20.790 --> 03:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
durability is we know that the gold
 
03:17:23.189 --> 03:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
standard is a pretty good durability but
 
03:17:25.189 --> 03:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
the newer procedures either with the
 
03:17:29.070 --> 03:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
paranal lining or the um colonic lining
 
03:17:31.469 --> 03:17:31.479 align:start position:0%
do not have any sort of idea as to how
 
03:17:33.389 --> 03:17:33.399 align:start position:0%
long they'll last and I know that I'm
 
03:17:35.670 --> 03:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
personally quite concerned that by
 
03:17:39.189 --> 03:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
rushing into into a procedure um you may
 
03:17:42.910 --> 03:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
end up unable to have that body part
 
03:17:45.389 --> 03:17:45.399 align:start position:0%
that has been so crucial to you um
 
03:17:47.630 --> 03:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
through a large amount of your lifetime
 
03:17:48.950 --> 03:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
therefore I think we need to proceed
 
03:17:48.960 --> 03:17:52.030 align:start position:0%
therefore I think we need to proceed
with

03:17:52.030 --> 03:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:52.040 --> 03:17:54.870 align:start position:0%
 
caution

03:17:54.870 --> 03:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
caution
 
03:17:57.550 --> 03:17:57.560 align:start position:0%
see and then that gets to the quality of
 
03:17:59.710 --> 03:17:59.720 align:start position:0%
evidence Dartmouth presented us with a
 
03:18:01.830 --> 03:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
letter stating that this is well
 
03:18:03.870 --> 03:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
researched we asked them for that
 
03:18:06.429 --> 03:18:06.439 align:start position:0%
research and we were provided
 
03:18:09.870 --> 03:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
with three points of information all of
 
03:18:12.150 --> 03:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
them were on puberty blockers or hor hor
 
03:18:16.309 --> 03:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:19.630 --> 03:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
surgery if there is no data that can be
 
03:18:21.309 --> 03:18:21.319 align:start position:0%
provided showing that this is in fact
 
03:18:23.870 --> 03:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
well researched and safe and efficacious
 
03:18:26.189 --> 03:18:26.199 align:start position:0%
um I'm very very very concerned about
 
03:18:28.910 --> 03:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
the provision of this care in this state
 
03:18:30.790 --> 03:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
um I've reached out against Dartmouth to
 
03:18:33.189 --> 03:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
ask them for that information um but
 
03:18:35.870 --> 03:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
nothing else has been
 
03:18:39.429 --> 03:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
forthcoming I we have worked together to
 
03:18:41.710 --> 03:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
um further narrow the amendment the one
 
03:18:43.110 --> 03:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
that I brought brought that we brought
 
03:18:45.309 --> 03:18:45.319 align:start position:0%
as the non- derain amendment had simply
 
03:18:47.830 --> 03:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
taken the previous sections of the bill
 
03:18:50.429 --> 03:18:50.439 align:start position:0%
um to not make too many changes to
 
03:18:52.870 --> 03:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
Simply reduce that down to the genital
 
03:18:55.590 --> 03:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
gender reassignment surgeries um this
 
03:18:58.110 --> 03:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
one has not been drafted with OS because
 
03:19:00.070 --> 03:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
they're under Inc incredible pressure
 
03:19:01.870 --> 03:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
between both retain bills and our new
 
03:19:05.269 --> 03:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
bills coming through um so they they've
 
03:19:06.710 --> 03:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
confirmed that this is in the right
 
03:19:09.630 --> 03:19:09.640 align:start position:0%
format and this is otherwise correct um
 
03:19:11.670 --> 03:19:11.680 align:start position:0%
but they asked that I present it U non
 
03:19:14.750 --> 03:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
formally today so so that means we can't
 
03:19:17.670 --> 03:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
vote on it today um we can vote to have
 
03:19:19.510 --> 03:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
this language in a work group we don't
 
03:19:21.229 --> 03:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
have to have the actual amendment in
 
03:19:22.990 --> 03:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
order to vote on it but in executive
 
03:19:25.110 --> 03:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
session we need to have the actual
 
03:19:25.120 --> 03:19:26.150 align:start position:0%
session we need to have the actual
amendment

03:19:26.150 --> 03:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:19:28.229 --> 03:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
number I
 
03:19:30.830 --> 03:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
see because we're just a casual group at
 
03:19:32.309 --> 03:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
this point we've been named we've been
 
03:19:34.349 --> 03:19:34.359 align:start position:0%
noticed we're having these meetings but
 
03:19:35.710 --> 03:19:35.720 align:start position:0%
because we're not a quorum of the
 
03:19:38.150 --> 03:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
meeting this is a directional um
 
03:19:40.269 --> 03:19:40.279 align:start position:0%
indication to the full committee and not
 
03:19:48.229 --> 03:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:50.910 --> 03:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
so in narrowing it down it brings it to
 
03:19:53.229 --> 03:19:53.239 align:start position:0%
a purpose stating that the legislature
 
03:19:54.630 --> 03:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
finds that the following facts and
 
03:19:56.309 --> 03:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
circumstances exist which make the
 
03:19:58.030 --> 03:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
enactment of the statute necessary for
 
03:19:59.670 --> 03:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
protection of minors and for furtherance
 
03:20:02.229 --> 03:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
of the public interest Physicians have
 
03:20:04.030 --> 03:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
an ethical and legal duty to obtain
 
03:20:05.550 --> 03:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
patients informed consent before
 
03:20:07.790 --> 03:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
ordering testing and treatment older
 
03:20:09.429 --> 03:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
children and Adolescent should be asked
 
03:20:11.070 --> 03:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
to provide their Ascent for treatment in
 
03:20:13.469 --> 03:20:13.479 align:start position:0%
addition to their parents permission a
 
03:20:15.349 --> 03:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
patient's informed consent requires
 
03:20:18.150 --> 03:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
adequate information capacity toci side
 
03:20:19.670 --> 03:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
and the absence of
 
03:20:22.590 --> 03:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
coercion best practices urge shared
 
03:20:24.070 --> 03:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
decision-making between parent or
 
03:20:26.309 --> 03:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
parents and child and in general
 
03:20:27.950 --> 03:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
preferring Alternatives that will not
 
03:20:30.110 --> 03:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
foreclose important future choices by
 
03:20:32.110 --> 03:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
the Adolescent and the adult the patient
 
03:20:34.990 --> 03:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
will become multivariant analyses of
 
03:20:38.189 --> 03:20:38.199 align:start position:0%
published studies between 2015 and 2022
 
03:20:41.070 --> 03:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
showed no decrease in suicidality after
 
03:20:42.950 --> 03:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
gender affirming surgery with some
 
03:20:44.630 --> 03:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
studies showing a significant increase
 
03:20:46.550 --> 03:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
in psychiatric hospitalizations and
 
03:20:49.110 --> 03:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
suicide after surgical transition and
 
03:20:50.790 --> 03:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lack of highquality clinical
 
03:20:52.630 --> 03:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
trials which provide data on outcomes
 
03:20:54.189 --> 03:20:54.199 align:start position:0%
for adolescent and genital gender
 
03:20:55.910 --> 03:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
reassignment surgeries or young adult
 
03:20:58.790 --> 03:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
genitor gender reassignment surgeries
 
03:21:00.950 --> 03:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
particularly after pral suppression and
 
03:21:02.349 --> 03:21:02.359 align:start position:0%
cross- seex
 
03:21:04.990 --> 03:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
hormones finding that adolescent genital
 
03:21:07.030 --> 03:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
gender reassignment surgery generally
 
03:21:08.790 --> 03:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
lacks both adequate information for
 
03:21:10.870 --> 03:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
informed consent and involves a high
 
03:21:13.389 --> 03:21:13.399 align:start position:0%
risk of coercion for parental consent
 
03:21:15.030 --> 03:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
when parents believe that they are faced
 
03:21:16.349 --> 03:21:16.359 align:start position:0%
with a choice between their child
 
03:21:18.269 --> 03:21:18.279 align:start position:0%
committing suicide or consenting to
 
03:21:19.510 --> 03:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
their child's genital gender
 
03:21:22.070 --> 03:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
reassignment surgeries and an AB the
 
03:21:23.990 --> 03:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
absence of highquality data to prove
 
03:21:26.189 --> 03:21:26.199 align:start position:0%
safety and efficacy including long-term
 
03:21:28.429 --> 03:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
outcomes only people over the age of
 
03:21:30.309 --> 03:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
majority should receive genital gender
 
03:21:32.830 --> 03:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
reassignment surgery in the state of New
 
03:21:35.349 --> 03:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it goes on to provide
 
03:21:37.590 --> 03:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
definitions to really make sure that we
 
03:21:39.950 --> 03:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
nail this down into
 
03:21:43.030 --> 03:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
specifically to exclude include any
 
03:21:45.110 --> 03:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
anything around a disorder of sex
 
03:21:46.830 --> 03:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
development um which would be
 
03:21:50.590 --> 03:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
malformations other ones to ex and just
 
03:21:52.830 --> 03:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it's very clear what
 
03:21:52.840 --> 03:21:54.670 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it's very clear what
is

03:21:54.670 --> 03:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:21:58.189 --> 03:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
included and then it pro it prohibits a
 
03:22:00.229 --> 03:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
physician from performing genital gender
 
03:22:01.870 --> 03:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
reassignment surgery on minors in the
 
03:22:03.710 --> 03:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and that's
 
03:22:06.590 --> 03:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
defined as surgical procedures in people
 
03:22:08.189 --> 03:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
born without disorders of sex
 
03:22:11.150 --> 03:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
development including but not limited to
 
03:22:13.910 --> 03:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
medas phalloplasty or vaginoplasty which
 
03:22:16.150 --> 03:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
seek to change genitalia from male
 
03:22:18.429 --> 03:22:18.439 align:start position:0%
genitalia to female genitalia from
 
03:22:20.870 --> 03:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
female genitalia to male genitalia to
 
03:22:22.469 --> 03:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
form a combination of male and female
 
03:22:24.590 --> 03:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
genitalia or an absence of genitalia and
 
03:22:26.309 --> 03:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
those born with exclusively male or
 
03:22:28.670 --> 03:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
exclusively female genitalia or by
 
03:22:33.590 --> 03:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:37.550 --> 03:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
genitalia so um it does not prohibit
 
03:22:38.830 --> 03:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
Physicians from performing
 
03:22:40.309 --> 03:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
reconstructive surgeries on the
 
03:22:42.150 --> 03:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
genitalia of miners to correct cor
 
03:22:44.590 --> 03:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
malformation malignancy injury or
 
03:22:47.150 --> 03:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
physical disease removal of malignant
 
03:22:49.910 --> 03:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
malformed or otherwise damaged genitalia
 
03:22:51.590 --> 03:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
genital surgeries on minors with
 
03:22:54.710 --> 03:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
disorders of sex development or male
 
03:22:57.429 --> 03:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
circumcision and then the enforcement um
 
03:22:59.550 --> 03:22:59.560 align:start position:0%
is around it um referral or provision
 
03:23:02.550 --> 03:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
being unprofessional conduct and to
 
03:23:05.510 --> 03:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
allow action
 
03:23:08.750 --> 03:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
um if if if it's found that somebody's
 
03:23:10.070 --> 03:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
rights have been
 
03:23:13.950 --> 03:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
violated so this is definitely whittling
 
03:23:16.790 --> 03:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
down this bill to just the idea of the
 
03:23:19.189 --> 03:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
genital gender reassignment
 
03:23:33.790 --> 03:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:40.269 --> 03:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:42.189 --> 03:23:42.199 align:start position:0%
thoughts represent
 
03:23:42.199 --> 03:23:43.950 align:start position:0%
thoughts represent
Canon

03:23:43.950 --> 03:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
Canon
 
03:23:47.070 --> 03:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm concerned that we're putting a a
 
03:23:50.269 --> 03:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
lot more into legislative effort that
 
03:23:53.070 --> 03:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
that um probably should be left to the
 
03:23:53.080 --> 03:23:54.469 align:start position:0%
that um probably should be left to the
medical

03:23:54.469 --> 03:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
medical
 
03:23:57.630 --> 03:23:57.640 align:start position:0%
community um it's like we are not
 
03:23:59.750 --> 03:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
MediCal experts we can read this which
 
03:24:01.870 --> 03:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
is good stuff but if it changes over
 
03:24:03.710 --> 03:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
time and we put it in the statute how
 
03:24:06.110 --> 03:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
quickly can we change it in the statute
 
03:24:07.710 --> 03:24:07.720 align:start position:0%
to reflect what's been changed by the
 
03:24:09.710 --> 03:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
medical community if we leave this in
 
03:24:11.229 --> 03:24:11.239 align:start position:0%
the hands of the medical community and
 
03:24:13.790 --> 03:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
let them know they need to do their job
 
03:24:17.590 --> 03:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
um that's a different story um uh the
 
03:24:19.389 --> 03:24:19.399 align:start position:0%
the the people who put together the
 
03:24:21.150 --> 03:24:21.160 align:start position:0%
world Prof World Professional
 
03:24:22.790 --> 03:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
Association of transgender Health has
 
03:24:24.870 --> 03:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
been around for a couple of decades and
 
03:24:26.469 --> 03:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
before that it was the Harry Benjamin
 
03:24:28.510 --> 03:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
standards of care so the people that
 
03:24:30.349 --> 03:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
have been working on this and I know for
 
03:24:32.269 --> 03:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
a fact they did not all agree with what
 
03:24:34.349 --> 03:24:34.359 align:start position:0%
was being produced over time they had to
 
03:24:36.030 --> 03:24:36.040 align:start position:0%
work together to make these things
 
03:24:39.189 --> 03:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
happen that is an organization that is
 
03:24:41.870 --> 03:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
focused on our transgender health New
 
03:24:43.670 --> 03:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature is focused on
 
03:24:45.790 --> 03:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
doing every everything for the community
 
03:24:47.469 --> 03:24:47.479 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire not just the
 
03:24:50.030 --> 03:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
transgender this is a lot of text to put
 
03:24:53.150 --> 03:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
into statute that could change over time
 
03:24:54.750 --> 03:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
and if we have to change it it will take
 
03:24:56.389 --> 03:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
a couple of years to change it in the
 
03:24:58.429 --> 03:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
meantime there there are going to be
 
03:25:00.550 --> 03:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
kids and families that are dependent on
 
03:25:03.070 --> 03:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
the medical uh Community they're working
 
03:25:04.870 --> 03:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
with to be able to make changes and to
 
03:25:08.030 --> 03:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
do things to help them and so so to put
 
03:25:11.229 --> 03:25:11.239 align:start position:0%
all this stuff into into statute is it's
 
03:25:11.239 --> 03:25:15.349 align:start position:0%
all this stuff into into statute is it's
crazy

03:25:15.349 --> 03:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:15.359 --> 03:25:16.510 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:25:16.510 --> 03:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:25:20.150 --> 03:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you madam chair
 
03:25:23.349 --> 03:25:23.359 align:start position:0%
um I respectfully um disagree with the
 
03:25:27.590 --> 03:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
previous comments I just um I think that
 
03:25:31.469 --> 03:25:31.479 align:start position:0%
when the interest of um children is on
 
03:25:34.550 --> 03:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
the table if the research
 
03:25:36.510 --> 03:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
changes there's a reason that our
 
03:25:38.309 --> 03:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
process takes so long that everything
 
03:25:41.189 --> 03:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
goes through um a lot of scrutiny you
 
03:25:45.429 --> 03:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
know multiple um hearings in both bodies
 
03:25:47.910 --> 03:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
and um you know we do the amendment
 
03:25:50.429 --> 03:25:50.439 align:start position:0%
process we hear from the public and what
 
03:25:52.790 --> 03:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
has been failed to be demonstrated here
 
03:25:57.790 --> 03:25:57.800 align:start position:0%
is that these are um efficacious and
 
03:26:01.269 --> 03:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
long and have long-term benefit that has
 
03:26:04.229 --> 03:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
not been demonstrated and I think that
 
03:26:06.389 --> 03:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
in order to protect this is a very small
 
03:26:09.150 --> 03:26:09.160 align:start position:0%
subset of people who goes for this kind
 
03:26:11.790 --> 03:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
of treatment but there is a history uh
 
03:26:14.790 --> 03:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
disturbing history and unfortunate one
 
03:26:17.269 --> 03:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
in medicine where minorities have been
 
03:26:21.630 --> 03:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
exploited um you know through the
 
03:26:24.790 --> 03:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
practices um that have been employed and
 
03:26:27.590 --> 03:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
I think here is a appropriate place for
 
03:26:29.990 --> 03:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature to step in and say put a
 
03:26:31.870 --> 03:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
pause on it in the state of New
 
03:26:34.150 --> 03:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if Massachusetts wants to
 
03:26:36.429 --> 03:26:36.439 align:start position:0%
continue to allow these surgeries it's
 
03:26:39.309 --> 03:26:39.319 align:start position:0%
not very far to go there and and seek
 
03:26:42.189 --> 03:26:42.199 align:start position:0%
and seek this care if it's for that very
 
03:26:45.510 --> 03:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
small number um Dartmouth said it's very
 
03:26:48.110 --> 03:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
rare that it occurs in children but they
 
03:26:49.790 --> 03:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
could not tell us that it doesn't happen
 
03:26:51.990 --> 03:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
here in children and they didn't give us
 
03:26:54.429 --> 03:26:54.439 align:start position:0%
a number they also didn't provide their
 
03:26:57.670 --> 03:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures for deciding how
 
03:27:01.229 --> 03:27:01.239 align:start position:0%
uh for um how it's decided if a minor is
 
03:27:03.590 --> 03:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
going to receive that care nor a body of
 
03:27:06.510 --> 03:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
evidence um demonstrating that this is
 
03:27:07.990 --> 03:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:27:12.830 --> 03:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
I the way I see it is if
 
03:27:17.510 --> 03:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
the um if the the literature changes and
 
03:27:20.590 --> 03:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
that takes years in itself then the
 
03:27:22.469 --> 03:27:22.479 align:start position:0%
legislature can then meet again and do
 
03:27:26.389 --> 03:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
its job and determine if the evidence is
 
03:27:29.550 --> 03:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
sufficient enough um to representatives
 
03:27:32.309 --> 03:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
of the people to allow these surgeries
 
03:27:34.469 --> 03:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but right now I don't
 
03:27:34.479 --> 03:27:37.349 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but right now I don't
see

03:27:37.349 --> 03:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:40.070 --> 03:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
that representative Missour yeah thank
 
03:27:42.790 --> 03:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
you I me mentioned in the last hearing I
 
03:27:47.550 --> 03:27:47.560 align:start position:0%
brought up the the billing codes and
 
03:27:51.910 --> 03:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
how it was very clear to me in research
 
03:27:53.750 --> 03:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
and and asking people that there were
 
03:27:57.510 --> 03:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
billing codes in place in another state
 
03:27:57.520 --> 03:27:58.870 align:start position:0%
billing codes in place in another state
um

03:27:58.870 --> 03:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:01.030 --> 03:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
for transition
 
03:28:07.630 --> 03:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:11.990 --> 03:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
for backtracking out of that and uh that
 
03:28:15.429 --> 03:28:15.439 align:start position:0%
became a serious issue so you I would
 
03:28:17.830 --> 03:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
like to
 
03:28:23.269 --> 03:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
see things like that in place so
 
03:28:27.910 --> 03:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't happen here so a
 
03:28:32.070 --> 03:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
child gets through a certain part of of
 
03:28:36.030 --> 03:28:36.040 align:start position:0%
a process and then has no way back and
 
03:28:38.910 --> 03:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
then has then has no way to pay for it
 
03:28:40.830 --> 03:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
or anything like that like they're
 
03:28:46.550 --> 03:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
really is no turning back um at and when
 
03:28:48.830 --> 03:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking
 
03:28:52.150 --> 03:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
minors like these could be small
 
03:28:55.950 --> 03:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
children that we've heard de
 
03:28:58.429 --> 03:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
developmentally it's like the age of
 
03:29:02.590 --> 03:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
26 that things keep changing um you know
 
03:29:03.630 --> 03:29:03.640 align:start position:0%
we hear
 
03:29:08.110 --> 03:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
about tattoos and um
 
03:29:10.110 --> 03:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
tanning that's
 
03:29:14.510 --> 03:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
not that is not allowed for minors there
 
03:29:16.750 --> 03:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
are reasons behind that so I hear you
 
03:29:18.590 --> 03:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
when you say putting statutes in place
 
03:29:21.950 --> 03:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
but we have statutes in place for other
 
03:29:21.960 --> 03:29:24.429 align:start position:0%
but we have statutes in place for other
things

03:29:24.429 --> 03:29:24.439 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:29:28.550 --> 03:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
that you C you can't turn back on this
 
03:29:31.990 --> 03:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
so this seems like a way more serious
 
03:29:34.590 --> 03:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
thing that you know and I and I heard
 
03:29:36.550 --> 03:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
last time too someone mentioned that
 
03:29:40.229 --> 03:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
this is an attack on um a certain
 
03:29:42.469 --> 03:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
community and that that's not what this
 
03:29:44.670 --> 03:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
is at all because many of us have
 
03:29:48.550 --> 03:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
friends in this community this is um if
 
03:29:52.389 --> 03:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
you're an adult and this is you go do
 
03:29:55.389 --> 03:29:55.399 align:start position:0%
your thing you know as adults do our
 
03:29:58.110 --> 03:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
thing we are talking specifically about
 
03:30:01.870 --> 03:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
minors and children um that have a huge
 
03:30:05.309 --> 03:30:05.319 align:start position:0%
future ahead of them and so
 
03:30:09.870 --> 03:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
they're why not you know get go through
 
03:30:13.150 --> 03:30:13.160 align:start position:0%
um the therapy and the processes that we
 
03:30:16.590 --> 03:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
do have in place and then you know at a
 
03:30:18.189 --> 03:30:18.199 align:start position:0%
certain age if that's still the
 
03:30:19.790 --> 03:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
direction they want to go then that's
 
03:30:23.150 --> 03:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
their decision but you know there is we
 
03:30:27.229 --> 03:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
are here as a legislature to stand for
 
03:30:29.550 --> 03:30:29.560 align:start position:0%
our children and for many of us that's
 
03:30:33.670 --> 03:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
what this is so to be to be told that
 
03:30:36.590 --> 03:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
this is an attack on that is personally
 
03:30:39.510 --> 03:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
highly offensive um because that's not
 
03:30:41.830 --> 03:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
what this is a lot I think of people
 
03:30:46.309 --> 03:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
just see this as um a protection for for
 
03:30:49.150 --> 03:30:49.160 align:start position:0%
kids that they're not quite there you
 
03:30:53.349 --> 03:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
know with making that decision and um so
 
03:30:54.429 --> 03:30:54.439 align:start position:0%
that's my take
 
03:30:57.349 --> 03:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
on representative
 
03:31:00.349 --> 03:31:00.359 align:start position:0%
Canon here's my concern is for the
 
03:31:03.229 --> 03:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
families with children that are faced
 
03:31:06.070 --> 03:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
with gender dysphoria is that we might
 
03:31:08.070 --> 03:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
be limiting the options they have to
 
03:31:09.510 --> 03:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
save their
 
03:31:12.150 --> 03:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
child and and uh that's one of the
 
03:31:14.590 --> 03:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
concerns that I have with with this bill
 
03:31:16.349 --> 03:31:16.359 align:start position:0%
even if it's just being presented
 
03:31:17.790 --> 03:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
because I know that there's a lot of
 
03:31:20.269 --> 03:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
children out there that are challenged
 
03:31:22.389 --> 03:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
that are looking to where are they going
 
03:31:24.590 --> 03:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
and that they're not accepted and if we
 
03:31:26.630 --> 03:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
as a legislature are putting new things
 
03:31:29.990 --> 03:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
in place they may not understand why
 
03:31:31.950 --> 03:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
we're doing that it just looks like
 
03:31:33.790 --> 03:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
someone just put a wall up and I'm not
 
03:31:36.189 --> 03:31:36.199 align:start position:0%
going to get past it and and maybe I
 
03:31:38.269 --> 03:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
need to do something else about it and
 
03:31:41.030 --> 03:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's scary there are therapy
 
03:31:42.990 --> 03:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
procedures though in
 
03:31:45.630 --> 03:31:45.640 align:start position:0%
place right now like so that is
 
03:31:47.870 --> 03:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
providing assistance to them it's not
 
03:31:52.229 --> 03:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
like there's nothing available
 
03:31:54.790 --> 03:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
right tell that to the child and the
 
03:31:56.950 --> 03:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
parent that's all already bringing their
 
03:32:00.189 --> 03:32:00.199 align:start position:0%
child of therapy who's struggling um
 
03:32:01.870 --> 03:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
I've seen inter with adults even that
 
03:32:03.510 --> 03:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
are struggling they go into therapy for
 
03:32:04.790 --> 03:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
things and then eventually they take
 
03:32:06.150 --> 03:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
their life because they don't see a
 
03:32:08.710 --> 03:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
future for themselves so I'm just I'm
 
03:32:10.990 --> 03:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
just putting it out there if we as we
 
03:32:13.349 --> 03:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
move forward I recognize that we're
 
03:32:15.630 --> 03:32:15.640 align:start position:0%
protecting children we have to and there
 
03:32:17.990 --> 03:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
are lots of things that the medical
 
03:32:19.990 --> 03:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
community is take is put in place and
 
03:32:22.630 --> 03:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
needs to work but if we as a legislature
 
03:32:25.670 --> 03:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
said no to that we put it in statute
 
03:32:29.150 --> 03:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
this is all you can get and and this
 
03:32:30.910 --> 03:32:30.920 align:start position:0%
we're we're doing something that limits
 
03:32:33.110 --> 03:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
things and and that's I'm saying if it
 
03:32:34.870 --> 03:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
changes in the medical community they
 
03:32:36.590 --> 03:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
can change it in the medal Community
 
03:32:38.510 --> 03:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
when it comes if it changes there we
 
03:32:40.950 --> 03:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
need to change it as a statute it could
 
03:32:43.389 --> 03:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
take two years to get it changed so in
 
03:32:45.870 --> 03:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
the meantime we have we have a family
 
03:32:47.790 --> 03:32:47.800 align:start position:0%
with kids that needs some assistance and
 
03:32:50.229 --> 03:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
we have a statute that says no you can't
 
03:32:50.239 --> 03:32:51.590 align:start position:0%
we have a statute that says no you can't
do

03:32:51.590 --> 03:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:32:51.600 --> 03:32:53.110 align:start position:0%
do
that

03:32:53.110 --> 03:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:32:55.389 --> 03:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
representative and then my understanding
 
03:33:00.110 --> 03:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
that the the main um gist of this bill
 
03:33:03.510 --> 03:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that uh gender
 
03:33:06.510 --> 03:33:06.520 align:start position:0%
reassignment surgeries do not happen uh
 
03:33:09.750 --> 03:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18 right and I agree
 
03:33:12.670 --> 03:33:12.680 align:start position:0%
with that and as far as I heard from
 
03:33:14.830 --> 03:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
everything I heard from Dartmouth they
 
03:33:18.269 --> 03:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
don't do it uh someone else on our
 
03:33:20.349 --> 03:33:20.359 align:start position:0%
committee said it's on their website you
 
03:33:22.309 --> 03:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
know you don't get gender reassignment
 
03:33:25.269 --> 03:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
surgery under 18 so I think we're going
 
03:33:29.309 --> 03:33:29.319 align:start position:0%
kind of far a field um I think we can
 
03:33:34.349 --> 03:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
agree you know we don't like to dictate
 
03:33:36.670 --> 03:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
03:33:40.389 --> 03:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
prescriptively um to what um doctors can
 
03:33:42.070 --> 03:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
do what what insurance companies can pay
 
03:33:47.510 --> 03:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
for or not but I think we can a agree on
 
03:33:49.630 --> 03:33:49.640 align:start position:0%
um those kinds of
 
03:33:51.870 --> 03:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
surgeries don't need to happen in New
 
03:33:54.590 --> 03:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire under 18 so I'm not sure we
 
03:33:57.110 --> 03:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
even need this bill if those surgeries
 
03:33:59.429 --> 03:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
are not happening under 18 I believe
 
03:34:02.670 --> 03:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
they're not I I believe others perhaps
 
03:34:08.349 --> 03:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
are more skeptical so um there's you
 
03:34:10.790 --> 03:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
know we don't need to be emotional uh
 
03:34:13.510 --> 03:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
about this it's always very important to
 
03:34:15.950 --> 03:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
protect children um those of us who have
 
03:34:19.710 --> 03:34:19.720 align:start position:0%
raided teenagers you know understand um
 
03:34:23.550 --> 03:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
changing of minds and growing into to
 
03:34:26.870 --> 03:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
new uh thoughts and you know all the all
 
03:34:29.590 --> 03:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
the changes that that happen but you
 
03:34:32.189 --> 03:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
know the the Bare Bones of this is no
 
03:34:34.389 --> 03:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
surgeries under 18 and I think we can
 
03:34:37.830 --> 03:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
agree on that so uh you know we we can't
 
03:34:40.309 --> 03:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
discuss all developmental teenager stuff
 
03:34:43.710 --> 03:34:43.720 align:start position:0%
we would be here for years so anyway I'd
 
03:34:46.469 --> 03:34:46.479 align:start position:0%
have teams by then representative
 
03:34:50.229 --> 03:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you um so on the on the
 
03:34:53.990 --> 03:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
other side um of Representative Canon's
 
03:34:54.000 --> 03:34:55.229 align:start position:0%
other side um of Representative Canon's
um

03:34:55.229 --> 03:34:55.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:58.110 --> 03:34:58.120 align:start position:0%
point at the same time if if it takes
 
03:35:00.710 --> 03:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
two years to change the law the other
 
03:35:03.750 --> 03:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
way if the research catches up to
 
03:35:06.110 --> 03:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
it that that was your argument you know
 
03:35:08.150 --> 03:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
in the meantime those kids would be
 
03:35:10.389 --> 03:35:10.399 align:start position:0%
maybe not have access to this certain
 
03:35:10.399 --> 03:35:11.590 align:start position:0%
maybe not have access to this certain
care

03:35:11.590 --> 03:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:35:13.429 --> 03:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
um which I don't see a good evidence
 
03:35:16.710 --> 03:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
base for in the one um hospital that
 
03:35:19.870 --> 03:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
says that they do it but rarely in
 
03:35:19.880 --> 03:35:21.830 align:start position:0%
says that they do it but rarely in
minors

03:35:21.830 --> 03:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
minors
 
03:35:24.710 --> 03:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
um on the other side of that if we don't
 
03:35:27.550 --> 03:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
pass this bill they acknowledge that
 
03:35:31.429 --> 03:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
it's rare they did not outright say that
 
03:35:33.950 --> 03:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
they don't do it and have not done
 
03:35:36.790 --> 03:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
it I have personally
 
03:35:40.309 --> 03:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
heard um of people children in New
 
03:35:42.750 --> 03:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sure who have received
 
03:35:46.269 --> 03:35:46.279 align:start position:0%
surgeries and meanwhile that can all
 
03:35:49.550 --> 03:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
take place without clinical trial data
 
03:35:52.110 --> 03:35:52.120 align:start position:0%
showing the eff efficacy of these
 
03:35:55.790 --> 03:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
surgeries on miners for the long
 
03:35:58.990 --> 03:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
term and I mean like surgical clinical
 
03:36:03.150 --> 03:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
trials where they compare the surgery to
 
03:36:06.189 --> 03:36:06.199 align:start position:0%
other treatments and therapies and have
 
03:36:09.830 --> 03:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
a control group also and you know there
 
03:36:11.790 --> 03:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
there's no systemic reviews on this
 
03:36:14.229 --> 03:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
there's no meta analyses all I've
 
03:36:16.510 --> 03:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
received so far are very are small
 
03:36:19.349 --> 03:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
studies that look at either surveys um
 
03:36:21.790 --> 03:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
telling about suicidal ideation with
 
03:36:23.990 --> 03:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers or with
 
03:36:27.469 --> 03:36:27.479 align:start position:0%
hormones um and they don't go long term
 
03:36:30.870 --> 03:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
so in the meantime we without evidence
 
03:36:33.830 --> 03:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
to show that this is clinically safe and
 
03:36:35.150 --> 03:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not just talking about suicide
 
03:36:38.550 --> 03:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
adiation wise there are kids who are
 
03:36:41.269 --> 03:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
going to be harmed by this
 
03:36:45.469 --> 03:36:45.479 align:start position:0%
irreversibly if we don't pass this
 
03:36:49.990 --> 03:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:52.510 --> 03:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
Canon I I think if we're looking for
 
03:36:54.309 --> 03:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
that kind of information we should be
 
03:36:56.349 --> 03:36:56.359 align:start position:0%
working with the world professional
 
03:36:57.910 --> 03:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
association from transgender health
 
03:36:59.790 --> 03:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
because those folks are doing this to
 
03:37:03.150 --> 03:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
try and and are tracking this the same
 
03:37:05.030 --> 03:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
type of information you're asking for
 
03:37:07.790 --> 03:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
it's not being done state byst state
 
03:37:11.189 --> 03:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
it's not being done uh uh
 
03:37:13.830 --> 03:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
outside of the medical community um so
 
03:37:16.070 --> 03:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
we're we're talking about things that
 
03:37:18.910 --> 03:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
are already being done at a at a medical
 
03:37:22.389 --> 03:37:22.399 align:start position:0%
level uh and not in not here we we are
 
03:37:24.030 --> 03:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
not MediCal experts we're totally
 
03:37:25.710 --> 03:37:25.720 align:start position:0%
dependent on the medical community to
 
03:37:28.309 --> 03:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
get this information just like just like
 
03:37:30.229 --> 03:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
introducing a new drug and and all this
 
03:37:31.830 --> 03:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
it needs that testing and stuff it
 
03:37:34.550 --> 03:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen by us the state agency
 
03:37:36.670 --> 03:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
it's totally dependent on the industry
 
03:37:40.150 --> 03:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's doing it now having said
 
03:37:42.030 --> 03:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
that I really appreciate what you've
 
03:37:45.990 --> 03:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
been doing here it I it's it's trying
 
03:37:48.030 --> 03:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
it's trying to narrow the focus and make
 
03:37:49.990 --> 03:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not hurting
 
03:37:53.750 --> 03:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
kids that that's that that is what
 
03:37:56.630 --> 03:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
ultimately we need to do I'm what I'm
 
03:37:58.910 --> 03:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
trying to say is here in the legislature
 
03:38:02.229 --> 03:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
is it our job to to do all of the
 
03:38:05.030 --> 03:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
medical review all that analysis is it
 
03:38:07.229 --> 03:38:07.239 align:start position:0%
and to have that and make our decisions
 
03:38:09.269 --> 03:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
made or should we go back to the medical
 
03:38:11.830 --> 03:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
community is it you have a duty to the
 
03:38:15.070 --> 03:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
public to do your job their job is is
 
03:38:19.070 --> 03:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
not to hurt someone it's physician
 
03:38:21.790 --> 03:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
heal people and if they're not doing
 
03:38:24.189 --> 03:38:24.199 align:start position:0%
that they're not doing their job but
 
03:38:26.189 --> 03:38:26.199 align:start position:0%
should we put that into statute as far
 
03:38:28.670 --> 03:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
as all this detail goes and if we do
 
03:38:30.630 --> 03:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
this and we're focused on the
 
03:38:33.469 --> 03:38:33.479 align:start position:0%
transgender Community are we not
 
03:38:35.710 --> 03:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
discriminating against all those other
 
03:38:38.030 --> 03:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
groups I mean this this group can
 
03:38:39.830 --> 03:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
compare to other groups we don't have
 
03:38:42.070 --> 03:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
things in for the MS Community we don't
 
03:38:44.269 --> 03:38:44.279 align:start position:0%
have things for kids with autism there's
 
03:38:46.990 --> 03:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
a whole spectrum of of child care things
 
03:38:48.950 --> 03:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
that need to be addressed this is just
 
03:38:52.070 --> 03:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
one community of people and right now uh
 
03:38:54.910 --> 03:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
this is from my my perspective this is
 
03:38:57.150 --> 03:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
discrimination we've zero in one and
 
03:38:58.670 --> 03:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
we're telling it we're taking it out of
 
03:39:01.110 --> 03:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
the medical community's hands who are
 
03:39:03.030 --> 03:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
involved with all these different things
 
03:39:04.110 --> 03:39:04.120 align:start position:0%
and now we're going to put it in the
 
03:39:06.550 --> 03:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
legislature and it says discrimination
 
03:39:09.269 --> 03:39:09.279 align:start position:0%
all over it because it's just a very
 
03:39:12.590 --> 03:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
small community of kids and people and
 
03:39:15.189 --> 03:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
and uh as far as I'm concerned and and
 
03:39:17.349 --> 03:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
the community is concerned it's really
 
03:39:21.349 --> 03:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
focused and and I understand your focus
 
03:39:23.550 --> 03:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
on in this particular Community but
 
03:39:26.110 --> 03:39:26.120 align:start position:0%
there's also other communities that have
 
03:39:28.630 --> 03:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
have surgical needs and medical needs
 
03:39:30.469 --> 03:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
and therapy needs and we're not
 
03:39:33.189 --> 03:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
addressing any of that maybe in doing
 
03:39:34.830 --> 03:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
this we ought to be addressing all those
 
03:39:37.469 --> 03:39:37.479 align:start position:0%
too so that's that's what bothers me is
 
03:39:39.510 --> 03:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
we just zeroed in on one community of
 
03:39:43.469 --> 03:39:43.479 align:start position:0%
kids um and we if if we do that for one
 
03:39:45.269 --> 03:39:45.279 align:start position:0%
part of the community shouldn't we be
 
03:39:48.830 --> 03:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
doing it for all of we this as far as
 
03:39:50.790 --> 03:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned and as far as many people
 
03:39:53.429 --> 03:39:53.439 align:start position:0%
are concerned this is discrimination and
 
03:39:55.030 --> 03:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
we have laws against that and the
 
03:39:57.389 --> 03:39:57.399 align:start position:0%
transgender Community including kids are
 
03:39:59.469 --> 03:39:59.479 align:start position:0%
called out in the we should not be
 
03:40:01.910 --> 03:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
discriminating in kids and as far as I'm
 
03:40:04.229 --> 03:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
concerned this stuff although it's good
 
03:40:06.750 --> 03:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
information is discrimination this ought
 
03:40:09.590 --> 03:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
to be in the working between families
 
03:40:10.670 --> 03:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
the kids
 
03:40:13.309 --> 03:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
and their medical care providers because
 
03:40:16.349 --> 03:40:16.359 align:start position:0%
it it's not a simple thing uh I know
 
03:40:19.269 --> 03:40:19.279 align:start position:0%
this because I I went through this whole
 
03:40:21.189 --> 03:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
process myself and working with the
 
03:40:23.710 --> 03:40:23.720 align:start position:0%
medical community to get my care and it
 
03:40:26.269 --> 03:40:26.279 align:start position:0%
was not a simple thing it's not I'm
 
03:40:28.830 --> 03:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
gonna I'm going to go get surgery no
 
03:40:31.349 --> 03:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
it's not it's many years of therapy it's
 
03:40:34.309 --> 03:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
many years of assistance it's it's even
 
03:40:36.590 --> 03:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
when I decided to get my think it took a
 
03:40:38.910 --> 03:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
full year and I ended up talking with a
 
03:40:40.349 --> 03:40:40.359 align:start position:0%
lot of people I had to provide
 
03:40:42.429 --> 03:40:42.439 align:start position:0%
statements from my therapist my
 
03:40:47.309 --> 03:40:47.319 align:start position:0%
psychologist my PCP my
 
03:40:49.429 --> 03:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
endocrinologist um and and a couple
 
03:40:54.229 --> 03:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
others to to even get in the door and
 
03:40:56.110 --> 03:40:56.120 align:start position:0%
then then I had to speak with three
 
03:40:57.389 --> 03:40:57.399 align:start position:0%
different surgeons who were going to be
 
03:41:00.030 --> 03:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
part of the surgical procedures it took
 
03:41:03.030 --> 03:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
a year and even then when I went in for
 
03:41:05.830 --> 03:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
my surgeries I got asked about six times
 
03:41:09.030 --> 03:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:12.269 --> 03:41:12.279 align:start position:0%
doing they are experts at what they do
 
03:41:14.469 --> 03:41:14.479 align:start position:0%
but they also are people they really
 
03:41:17.870 --> 03:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
care about their patients and and
 
03:41:20.870 --> 03:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's this putting it into legislation
 
03:41:24.030 --> 03:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
is is taking some of that away from that
 
03:41:26.870 --> 03:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
those people that care for kids we' put
 
03:41:28.990 --> 03:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
it down not only do they have to figure
 
03:41:31.309 --> 03:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
out what is the medical community tell
 
03:41:32.990 --> 03:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
me what's the best thing to do to help
 
03:41:36.269 --> 03:41:36.279 align:start position:0%
this child with with current knowledge
 
03:41:38.229 --> 03:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
and current tools and then they have to
 
03:41:40.630 --> 03:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
go back and say to the state what can I
 
03:41:43.830 --> 03:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
do based on what you put in statute and
 
03:41:46.229 --> 03:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
are are we limiting the care that
 
03:41:50.670 --> 03:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
someone can get by doing this um my
 
03:41:54.269 --> 03:41:54.279 align:start position:0%
question would U is sorry my question
 
03:41:56.830 --> 03:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
regarding the discriminatory law would
 
03:42:00.469 --> 03:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
be questioning if in 1970 we had put in
 
03:42:04.550 --> 03:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
a Prohibition to prohibit the prohibit
 
03:42:07.309 --> 03:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
doctors from failing to provide
 
03:42:10.429 --> 03:42:10.439 align:start position:0%
antibiotics to black men with syphilis
 
03:42:13.030 --> 03:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
if protecting that Minority Community by
 
03:42:15.189 --> 03:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
preventing a medical practice that was
 
03:42:16.870 --> 03:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
happening would have been discriminatory
 
03:42:18.070 --> 03:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
or if it would have been
 
03:42:20.389 --> 03:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
protective I think that's a little far
 
03:42:23.510 --> 03:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
field um and we're we're talking about
 
03:42:26.189 --> 03:42:26.199 align:start position:0%
the whether medical guidelines are the
 
03:42:28.070 --> 03:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
end all be all or if occasionally
 
03:42:29.830 --> 03:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
there's time for the legislation of
 
03:42:31.349 --> 03:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
Representative n I'm sorry I didn't mean
 
03:42:34.510 --> 03:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
to stuff on your toes no um um
 
03:42:34.520 --> 03:42:35.830 align:start position:0%
to stuff on your toes no um um
representative

03:42:35.830 --> 03:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:42:38.950 --> 03:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
Canon we're we're this bill is focused
 
03:42:42.149 --> 03:42:42.159 align:start position:0%
on children and you know we've heard
 
03:42:45.469 --> 03:42:45.479 align:start position:0%
your story and we care for you and all
 
03:42:48.950 --> 03:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
those things but I I want to focus back
 
03:42:53.710 --> 03:42:53.720 align:start position:0%
on um I I think we're at at a point are
 
03:42:56.630 --> 03:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
we not able to vote whether this
 
03:43:00.229 --> 03:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee recommends or not and then
 
03:43:05.070 --> 03:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
we take it to our executive um meeting
 
03:43:08.790 --> 03:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
on Monday and then it goes I as I say to
 
03:43:12.830 --> 03:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
the 400 you know to the full house so um
 
03:43:15.110 --> 03:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
we can we can do a lot of sidebars here
 
03:43:18.590 --> 03:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
but it could be a long day and uh we are
 
03:43:23.429 --> 03:43:23.439 align:start position:0%
in agreement on some minor issues I am a
 
03:43:27.349 --> 03:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
little I will leave it to OS to decide
 
03:43:30.229 --> 03:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
if this language is something that one
 
03:43:33.950 --> 03:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
puts in a bill it seems more of a a a
 
03:43:38.070 --> 03:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
summary of um facts it seems a little
 
03:43:40.389 --> 03:43:40.399 align:start position:0%
out of form to me but I'm not an expert
 
03:43:43.790 --> 03:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
in that so I'm going to leave it to them
 
03:43:46.469 --> 03:43:46.479 align:start position:0%
and leave it to the Judgment of our
 
03:43:49.590 --> 03:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
fellow legislators um about how we
 
03:43:52.269 --> 03:43:52.279 align:start position:0%
proceed from here representative M I
 
03:43:54.630 --> 03:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
just have a just
 
03:43:58.830 --> 03:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
a respectfully I I I hear your story
 
03:44:01.750 --> 03:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
and that and correct me if I'm wrong you
 
03:44:04.590 --> 03:44:04.600 align:start position:0%
you went through you know as an adult
 
03:44:08.429 --> 03:44:08.439 align:start position:0%
that those procedures as an adult um
 
03:44:11.990 --> 03:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
whereas you know I just heard from she
 
03:44:13.670 --> 03:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
stood up in front of group of people
 
03:44:15.950 --> 03:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
last week and yes this is in
 
03:44:18.189 --> 03:44:18.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but that's the thing is
 
03:44:20.670 --> 03:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
like knowing that that could happen here
 
03:44:23.229 --> 03:44:23.239 align:start position:0%
is really you know disturbing to me that
 
03:44:26.870 --> 03:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts she walked in um you
 
03:44:30.389 --> 03:44:30.399 align:start position:0%
know as a minor and within 45 minutes
 
03:44:32.309 --> 03:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
this is a doctor she didn't go to a
 
03:44:35.229 --> 03:44:35.239 align:start position:0%
therapist or anything within 45 minutes
 
03:44:36.590 --> 03:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
was put on
 
03:44:39.429 --> 03:44:39.439 align:start position:0%
testosterone and then soon after walked
 
03:44:42.550 --> 03:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
in you know and then was able to have a
 
03:44:45.349 --> 03:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
double myectomy no therapy at all she'll
 
03:44:47.910 --> 03:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
tell you this she and she was here at at
 
03:44:50.229 --> 03:44:50.239 align:start position:0%
our hearing when we when we first did
 
03:44:53.750 --> 03:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
this and and since then she's in her 20s
 
03:44:55.790 --> 03:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
and all of her reproductive organs have
 
03:45:00.510 --> 03:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
been removed and she is so when you know
 
03:45:04.309 --> 03:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
I we hear that your story we hear that
 
03:45:06.389 --> 03:45:06.399 align:start position:0%
story it but it's it's finding the
 
03:45:09.790 --> 03:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
balance of you know and as
 
03:45:11.309 --> 03:45:11.319 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter upam said we're
 
03:45:12.710 --> 03:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
03:45:15.790 --> 03:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
children and that's our focus and we're
 
03:45:18.229 --> 03:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
talking about genital reassignment
 
03:45:20.389 --> 03:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
surgery only on children that you can't
 
03:45:21.950 --> 03:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
go back on that's the thing we're
 
03:45:23.990 --> 03:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
talking about exactly we're not trying
 
03:45:28.990 --> 03:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
to outlaw therapy right and um uh
 
03:45:32.429 --> 03:45:32.439 align:start position:0%
hormone blockers which you know as
 
03:45:35.630 --> 03:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
uh um children are going through puberty
 
03:45:38.309 --> 03:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
earlier and earlier for we're not sure
 
03:45:41.750 --> 03:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
what reasons and so there's a lot of
 
03:45:44.590 --> 03:45:44.600 align:start position:0%
other reasons besides wanting to change
 
03:45:48.510 --> 03:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
their gender or sex that whatever so
 
03:45:51.630 --> 03:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
um many of the stories that you know
 
03:45:53.269 --> 03:45:53.279 align:start position:0%
people have told are are a little
 
03:45:55.309 --> 03:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
terrifying and frightening but I'd like
 
03:45:58.309 --> 03:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
to you know pull us back to with what we
 
03:46:01.389 --> 03:46:01.399 align:start position:0%
agree on is the yeah and I think this
 
03:46:04.790 --> 03:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
bill now is a testament to this
 
03:46:07.030 --> 03:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and the work that we've
 
03:46:10.110 --> 03:46:10.120 align:start position:0%
done in getting it to the roof
 
03:46:11.790 --> 03:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
you know look at the things that have
 
03:46:14.070 --> 03:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
been removed from it that's a that's a
 
03:46:15.830 --> 03:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
testament that we've been listening to
 
03:46:18.469 --> 03:46:18.479 align:start position:0%
people and we've been making the changes
 
03:46:20.790 --> 03:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
you know and so we have there's a lot of
 
03:46:22.870 --> 03:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
stuff that's been removed from this
 
03:46:25.950 --> 03:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
because we are listening to PE you know
 
03:46:29.349 --> 03:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
all communities um and you and parents
 
03:46:32.030 --> 03:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
and PE you know people in in the
 
03:46:34.389 --> 03:46:34.399 align:start position:0%
different communities so I think the
 
03:46:35.950 --> 03:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
work that we've done in getting this
 
03:46:38.870 --> 03:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
bill to where it's at now is is
 
03:46:38.880 --> 03:46:40.710 align:start position:0%
bill to where it's at now is is
something

03:46:40.710 --> 03:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:46:42.950 --> 03:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
and I do have one other part about the
 
03:46:44.670 --> 03:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
fact that we don't always the doctors
 
03:46:46.550 --> 03:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
aren't always following all of the
 
03:46:49.389 --> 03:46:49.399 align:start position:0%
clinical guidelines in the W path
 
03:46:50.870 --> 03:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
standard of care 8 it says that
 
03:46:52.590 --> 03:46:52.600 align:start position:0%
providers should be prepared to support
 
03:46:55.229 --> 03:46:55.239 align:start position:0%
adolescent who do R transition and it
 
03:46:57.229 --> 03:46:57.239 align:start position:0%
states uh it it cites a study the
 
03:47:00.389 --> 03:47:00.399 align:start position:0%
vanderbush uh 2021 study saying that
 
03:47:02.189 --> 03:47:02.199 align:start position:0%
many of them expressed difficulties
 
03:47:04.309 --> 03:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
finding help during their Dre transition
 
03:47:06.990 --> 03:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
process and it was an isolating there
 
03:47:08.510 --> 03:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
reported their D transition was an
 
03:47:10.070 --> 03:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
isolating experience during which they
 
03:47:11.550 --> 03:47:11.560 align:start position:0%
did not receive either sufficient or
 
03:47:13.790 --> 03:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate support despite best
 
03:47:15.469 --> 03:47:15.479 align:start position:0%
practices and despite the fact that
 
03:47:17.229 --> 03:47:17.239 align:start position:0%
people are working and trying to do
 
03:47:19.830 --> 03:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
their absolute best some doctors are
 
03:47:22.269 --> 03:47:22.279 align:start position:0%
humans too those who set the policies
 
03:47:25.229 --> 03:47:25.239 align:start position:0%
for hospitals are humans too um and
 
03:47:27.710 --> 03:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
that's why I believe that taking these
 
03:47:29.910 --> 03:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
findings from the W path would state
 
03:47:32.510 --> 03:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
that there are not those data on there
 
03:47:34.510 --> 03:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
is not sufficient data yet and they see
 
03:47:35.990 --> 03:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
that they need to give to a narrative
 
03:47:38.149 --> 03:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
review as opposed to a meta analysis
 
03:47:39.510 --> 03:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
because there are not sufficient data
 
03:47:41.670 --> 03:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
data to even provide a meta analysis
 
03:47:43.429 --> 03:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
within the standard of care I think
 
03:47:45.269 --> 03:47:45.279 align:start position:0%
that's why I think that's why it's
 
03:47:47.269 --> 03:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate to act here and quite
 
03:47:49.269 --> 03:47:49.279 align:start position:0%
frankly the reason why there is this
 
03:47:51.429 --> 03:47:51.439 align:start position:0%
information regarding sort of the state
 
03:47:53.750 --> 03:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
of where medicine is now is so that if
 
03:47:55.630 --> 03:47:55.640 align:start position:0%
the standard of care nine comes out and
 
03:47:56.950 --> 03:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of clinical evidence
 
03:48:00.630 --> 03:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
that shows that that what was in place
 
03:48:03.149 --> 03:48:03.159 align:start position:0%
when we put this into law is no longer
 
03:48:05.469 --> 03:48:05.479 align:start position:0%
fact that will be a great reason for a
 
03:48:07.469 --> 03:48:07.479 align:start position:0%
future legislature to reverse course and
 
03:48:09.550 --> 03:48:09.560 align:start position:0%
say actually no now there is high
 
03:48:11.349 --> 03:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
quality data that proves the safety and
 
03:48:14.149 --> 03:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
efficacy of um of gender genital
 
03:48:15.429 --> 03:48:15.439 align:start position:0%
reassignment surgeries with the
 
03:48:17.910 --> 03:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
procedures that are offered to minors if
 
03:48:19.790 --> 03:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
when that data is there there goes that
 
03:48:22.030 --> 03:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
argument um but the data are not there
 
03:48:24.030 --> 03:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
and I believe that protect that that
 
03:48:26.389 --> 03:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
this is the way to protect um I think we
 
03:48:28.870 --> 03:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
may we may have reached the conclusion I
 
03:48:31.110 --> 03:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
don't want to stop anybody from
 
03:48:35.189 --> 03:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:38.349 --> 03:48:38.359 align:start position:0%
motion you probably do you want to
 
03:48:41.830 --> 03:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
representative kushman um I move that we
 
03:48:43.510 --> 03:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
recommend to the full committee that we
 
03:48:46.110 --> 03:48:46.120 align:start position:0%
adopt this amendment
 
03:48:52.110 --> 03:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:54.189 --> 03:48:54.199 align:start position:0%
committee okay and seconded by
 
03:48:54.199 --> 03:48:56.830 align:start position:0%
committee okay and seconded by
representative

03:48:56.830 --> 03:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:58.790 --> 03:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
Missour I think we've had enough
 
03:49:00.670 --> 03:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
discussion so I can call the role would
 
03:49:03.189 --> 03:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
that be correct y okay representative n
 
03:49:06.469 --> 03:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
upam no representative Canon no
 
03:49:08.469 --> 03:49:08.479 align:start position:0%
representative Missour yes
 
03:49:11.070 --> 03:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
representative Kush yes representative
 
03:49:13.269 --> 03:49:13.279 align:start position:0%
Shapiro is not here and representative
 
03:49:16.590 --> 03:49:16.600 align:start position:0%
Lon is yes so that would be uh two to
 
03:49:18.950 --> 03:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
one with one absence to recommend that
 
03:49:20.469 --> 03:49:20.479 align:start position:0%
this language be drafted into an
 
03:49:22.710 --> 03:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
official Amendment for the committee to
 
03:49:25.670 --> 03:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
adopt so if there's not any further
 
03:49:28.229 --> 03:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
discussion oh yes representative missor

to me then so when you I heard you
 
03:49:38.630 --> 03:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
say um I think it was just to move it
 
03:49:40.790 --> 03:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
along just she wasn't ready to make the
 
03:49:42.389 --> 03:49:42.399 align:start position:0%
motion but she wanted somebody to make
 
03:49:44.030 --> 03:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
the motion just because she didn't think
 
03:49:47.070 --> 03:49:47.080 align:start position:0%
we were going to come to a full
 
03:49:51.110 --> 03:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:56.269 --> 03:49:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:56.279 --> 03:50:00.469 align:start position:0%
