everybody out of here by 11:00 there's
 
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
no reason we're not going to do any
 
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
heavy lifting or anything
 
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to rely a lot on the older
 
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
members to correct not to correct but to
 
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
add add into things that they think the
 
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
new members of this committee need to
 
00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
know and that's basically what we're
 
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
going to just doing today um we've we've
 
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
got three bills so far you should I'm
 
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
sorry we got four but they've they've
 
00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
only got three that's been printed out
 
00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
you should have them all um we'll be
 
00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
addressing those in a week or
 
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
two we are going to have to share this
 
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
room with Health and Human
 
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
Services uh so our letter drawers our
 
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
mailboxes I call them uh don't get used
 
00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
to having those in in six months we're
 
00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 align:start position:0%
going to have to completely vacate this
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
building and we're going to go somewhere
 
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
else and we probably won't have drawers
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
we probably won't have an assigned room
 
00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's going to be chaos after that
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
so we're going to try and get everything
 
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
that we possibly can done out of here by
 
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
June uh having said that uh I want to go
 
00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 align:start position:0%

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
please copy in representative cluder so
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
he's aware of that um that takes care of
 
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
absences another thing we're going to
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
ask you to because I know some people
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
are rather personal about this is
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
between now and the next next time we
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
meet we're going to I'm going to ask our
 
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
clerk representative Boyd to get
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
everybody's um working emails if you
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
don't want your email to go to your
 
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
legislative email uh just so that we can
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
get a hold of you in case of some kind
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
of short notice emergency you know we do
 
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
hb25 here which has got a lot of heavy
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
lifting and a lot of short notices to
 
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
get that capital budget done and
 
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
including with that um your emails any
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
any phone numbers so that we can contact
 
00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
you we won't abuse it we won't send it
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
out uh it's it's worked very well over
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
the years for privately working with
 
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:31.990 align:start position:0%
the years for privately working with
this

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
committee uh and has been mentioned a
 
00:20:36.029 --> 00:20:36.039 align:start position:0%
number of times this is probably the
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
most nonpartisan Committee in this
 
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
entire L Office Building um we pride
 
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
ourselves in most of our bills I would
 
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
guess 90% of our bills go on the consent
 
00:20:52.149 --> 00:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
calendar out of the 10% that don't go on
 
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar I would guess 8% of
 
00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
those 10% is because it's got a a fiscal
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
note and it can't go on the consent
 
00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:03.400 align:start position:0%
calendar so we like to work out all our
 
00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
problems the best part about this is we
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
are just committed to this state's
 
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure it's roads it's Bridges
 
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
it's highways it's buildings it's if you
 
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
can build it we supervise it and we
 
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
build it we build it we fix it and um
 
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
our great partner in doing all that is
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
the do and I'm going to ask them to
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:30.640 align:start position:0%

please and I can tell we're mostly of a
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
certain age that we don't have to worry
 
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:00.600 align:start position:0%

any of our uh
 
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
multi multi-year members want to bring
 
00:22:41.269 --> 00:22:41.279 align:start position:0%

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
do representative pulner I just want to
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
say appreciate the the comments I I
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
think the best thing about this
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
committee is that we talk things through
 
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
people don't understand something or
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
disagree we try to work it out
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh that's I think the best way to
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
approach everything I wish every
 
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
committee could do that but we're uh
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
we've got a tremendous history of U
 
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
working together I really appreciate
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%

00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%

Amendment once on on the apostrophes and
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
the and the semicolons on where
 
00:23:31.149 --> 00:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
something should be in a bill we've long
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
since found out that we don't have to do
 
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.789 align:start position:0%
since found out that we don't have to do
that

00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:33.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
anymore but that's the way we work
 
00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
together in this committee

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
here and I spoke to representative
 
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
fidelia and representative Jack over the
 
00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
holiday time we had an opportunity to
 
00:23:57.679 --> 00:23:59.310 align:start position:0%
holiday time we had an opportunity to
travel

00:23:59.310 --> 00:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
travel
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
to South Florida and to Asheville North
 
00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:06.039 align:start position:0%
Carolina I saw the results of tornadoes
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
that hit the Port St Lucy area um after
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
the Hurricanes the
 
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
existing um compromising of trees and
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
traffic signs that are still all bent uh
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
sheet metal and trees and then in
 
00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
Asheville the continued rebuilding of
 
00:24:28.029 --> 00:24:28.039 align:start position:0%
their infrastructure it gave me a huge
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
um perspective on how important do
 
00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure roads Bridges and these
 
00:24:37.149 --> 00:24:37.159 align:start position:0%
were things that could not have been
 
00:24:40.029 --> 00:24:40.039 align:start position:0%
prevented but people were working around
 
00:24:42.909 --> 00:24:42.919 align:start position:0%
the clock to keep things moving and
 
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
you seeing nobody else then at that
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%

1651 permanent positions where a
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
significant sized agency but we'll talk
 
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
about a little bit in the future how
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
that number has come down over the years
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
not not increased we also want to
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
highlight that currently we have 404
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
vacancies or

24% of our Workforce and that's
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
impacting how well we can we can meet
 
00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:23.919 align:start position:0%
our mission of Transportation Excellence

bridges of which
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
23 are on the red list all of our
 
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
bridges are inspected every two years
 
00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:44.679 align:start position:0%
unless they're on the Red List in which
 
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
case they get inspected more
 
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
frequently um some other key facts we
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
have about 4600 centaline miles of of
 
00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
roadway we target Paving 500 C miles per

some others in that in that table from a
funding

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
perspective um in fiscal year 2024 our
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
actual expenditures were $72
 
00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519 align:start position:0%
million we like to to show in the in the
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
chart below that of that
 
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
702 56% of it or almost 400 million of
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
it goes to Municipal Aid and

department advertises and oversees the
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
construction of it 44% of those funds
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
come to our operating which is um
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
maintenance and operations uh Personnel
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
cost winter maintenance um and so
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
forth diving in a little deeper to
 
00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics Rail and transit for

to those 12 federally funded
 
00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:35.240 align:start position:0%
airports um we have 13 airports that do

made up of the executive office I
 
00:34:38.829 --> 00:34:38.839 align:start position:0%
described a little as as we started um
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
we do charge some some of our budgetary
 
00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:46.280 align:start position:0%

the executive office we have a public
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
information person and we work on our
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
management strategy as well in
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
administration we also have finance that
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
helps us with the the budget contract
 
00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
management running our our federal
 
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
program although we get a a significant
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
amount of federal funds those funds come
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
in very specific buckets and we have to
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
manage what those federal funds get
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
spent on we don't have full discretion
 
00:35:34.349 --> 00:35:34.359 align:start position:0%
to put those funds wherever we want we
 
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
have to meet the federal funding formula
 
00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
so we spend some time with that in
 
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
financing in policy in administration we
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
have human resources internal audit our
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
occupational health and safety section
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
um focused on the health and safety of
 
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
our internal dot Employees Federal
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
compliance and hearings and
 
00:36:02.589 --> 00:36:02.599 align:start position:0%
legislation our division of project
 
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:05.800 align:start position:0%
development that's our group that plans
 
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
engineers and supports um the right of
 
00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
way and our construction program that's
 
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
a group that builds our 10-year plan
 
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
that you all will will see we'll talk
 
00:36:20.589 --> 00:36:20.599 align:start position:0%
about that that that schedule coming in
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
a in a minute in fiscal year 2024 our
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
project development section add 84 new
 
00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
construction contracts and provided
 
00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
construction oversight of 85 existing
 
00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:38.839 align:start position:0%
active construction projects those
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
construction projects totaled a combined
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
value of $800
 
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
million also last fiscal year we
 
00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:50.079 align:start position:0%
advertised um
 
00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
$331 Million worth of of new
 
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
projects on the maintenance and
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
operations side um we have a bureau of
 
00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
Highway Maintenance and that's broken up
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
into six districts Statewide we have 86
 
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
different Patrol
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
sections um or I'm sorry 84 separate
 
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
Patrol sections we maintain 4600 ceni
 
00:37:20.349 --> 00:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
miles of roadway this is the the group
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
that does our um winter operations that
 
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
does our our summer work plan that we
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
administer um ourselves that responds to
 
00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
emergencies um tries to keep up with our
 
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
guard rail maintenance drainage
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance Mowing and and everything
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
else I always like to point out 84
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
Patrol sections it sounds like a lot but
 
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
the reason we're successful with our
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance program it's because
 
00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
of our Logistics because we're set up
 
00:37:56.829 --> 00:37:56.839 align:start position:0%
and 84 sections really leaves one
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
section for about every three town
 
00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
cities or towns in the state so it's
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
it's not as much when you think of the
 
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
geographical area that that we cover
 
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
also in our Operations Division we have
 
00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:12.200 align:start position:0%
our Bureau traffic that's responsible
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
for roadway line striping we strive to
 
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
stripe our roads every year the paint
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
that we use um wears off with the snow
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
plows in the winter and the traffic in
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
the summer so we strive to restripe our
 
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
road roads every year they take care of
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
signs um traffic signals and they also
 
00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
manage our speed limits we have a bureau
 
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
of bridge maintenance that maintains our
 
00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.109 align:start position:0%
of bridge maintenance that maintains our
state

00:38:40.109 --> 00:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
Bridges um our Mechanical Services
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
Bureau that takes care of our Fleet our
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
Fleet exceeds uh a th000 units the the
 
00:38:52.589 --> 00:38:52.599 align:start position:0%
value of our Fleet exceeds a hundred
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
million and this is a group that takes
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
care of that and manages that Fleet we
 
00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
have a fuel distribution section that
 
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
maintains 87 fuel sites Statewide that
 
00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
not just the Department transportation
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
uses but communities can use some
 
00:39:12.309 --> 00:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
nonprofits can use as well and that fuel
 
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
management system serves as a strategic
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
Reserve in case ever anything ever were
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
to interrupt the the flow of fuel we
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
could keep our trucks rolling and
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
provide fuel for for state police and
 
00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
others we also have a transportation
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
systems management and operation Bureau
 
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
that manages the traffic on the road
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
through our intelligent transportation
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
system a little bit uh about the the
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
highway fund and how we're funded we
 
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
explain it that the highway fund is not
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
the dot and the do is not the highway
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
fund which basically means all of the
 
00:39:58.109 --> 00:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
money that's generated from
 
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
the what we call the road toll or the
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
fuel tax registrations and so forth that
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't all come to do a portion of that
 
00:40:11.069 --> 00:40:11.079 align:start position:0%
goes to Department of Safety a portion
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
of that goes to the communities and the
 
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
small portion of that goes to some other
 
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
agencies as as
 
00:40:23.069 --> 00:40:23.079 align:start position:0%
well we also use the the highway fund uh
 
00:40:26.109 --> 00:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
federal funds a federal program flows
 
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
through the Highway F fund as as well um
 
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
the state highway fund the non-federal
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
portion is a primary source of our
 
00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:37.670 align:start position:0%
portion is a primary source of our
funding

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:40:40.589 --> 00:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
budget um and in
 
00:40:40.599 --> 00:40:42.430 align:start position:0%
budget um and in
2024

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
2024
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
57.1% of the highway fund was
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
appropriated to do um almost 30% to
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
other agencies and 133% to
 
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:55.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities we also have our Turnpike
 
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
system and we're very fortunate
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to have that that Turnpike
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
system the turnpike system operates as
 
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
an Enterprise fund which means the money
 
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
generated in the turnpike system has to
 
00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
stay in the turnpike system so when we
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
talk about financial challenges it's not
 
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
like we can raise the tolls and spend
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
that money anywhere we want to around
 
00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
the state the the turnpike system
 
00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:26.079 align:start position:0%
self-supported but the money raised
 
00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
there has to stay there and there's some
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
facts and figures uh about the size of
 
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
that system in your
 
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
presentation um finally we get to some
 
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
issues and and challenges that we have
 
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner Cass stated it very
 
00:41:46.829 --> 00:41:46.839 align:start position:0%
well in his budget presentation this
 
00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
year when he said we are accomplishing
 
00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
what we need to um but we're not able to
 
00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
do all the things that we think we
 
00:41:59.230 --> 00:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
should be doing um and a little bit of
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
of the reason why um was one is
 
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
inflation and what I can tell you about
 
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
our construction cost we talk about two
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
things with construction costs we talk
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
about inflation but we also talk about
 
00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
escalation so since we've come come out
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
of the covid-19 pandemic we continue to
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
see rapid
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
escalation of construction costs that
 
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
that are not accounted with in a regular
 
00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
as high as
 
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
3.7% inflation that we try to put put on
 
00:42:41.549 --> 00:42:41.559 align:start position:0%
our projects to keep up with things and
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing now is that also takes
 
00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
on a regional characteristic uh around
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
the state there are parts of the states
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
where bids are coming in very close to
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
to what our estimates are in other parts
 
00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:00.280 align:start position:0%
of the state where the bids may be 40%
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
greater than than what our estimates are
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
and that's largely driven by Workforce
 
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
the contractor's ability to to um hire
 
00:43:14.829 --> 00:43:14.839 align:start position:0%
folks to to keep folks and also duration
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
of projects and more complex projects
 
00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
get more expensive than than we think
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
they they should
 
00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
be um a little bit more um on a
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
vacancies again I mentioned
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
24% we are focused on what we call
 
00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention but we still
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
have a difficult time attracting and
 
00:43:38.839 --> 00:43:40.030 align:start position:0%
have a difficult time attracting and
retaining

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
retaining
 
00:43:43.549 --> 00:43:43.559 align:start position:0%
employees um we Al also have a difficult
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
time with some of our winter maintenance
 
00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
contract rental providers winter
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance we we do uh about half do
 
00:43:57.309 --> 00:43:57.319 align:start position:0%
people in trucks and about half rented
 
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
contractor people in trucks and as time
 
00:44:02.549 --> 00:44:02.559 align:start position:0%
goes on it's getting more and more
 
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
difficult to attract those th that
 
00:44:08.349 --> 00:44:08.359 align:start position:0%
contract rental agreement um with a
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
truck and Driver this is not something a
 
00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
big roadway contractors want to do this
 
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
is something more the the
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
backyard um contractors and there used
 
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
to be a lot of farmers would do with
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
their equipment and people in the winter
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
and they just they're they're not there
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
like they
 
00:44:28.829 --> 00:44:28.839 align:start position:0%
they used to
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
be um so from a productivity perspective
 
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
because of these challenges we do fall
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
short on some of our our targets that
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
we'd like to achieve we're prioritizing
 
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
resources to the most critical areas um
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
but we are reducing some of our
 
00:44:51.069 --> 00:44:51.079 align:start position:0%
preventative maintenance and that
 
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
preventative maintenance is is the best
 
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
way to drive the lowest life cycle cost
 
00:44:59.549 --> 00:44:59.559 align:start position:0%
for our roads and and bridges and all
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
our assets so issues and challenges um
 
00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
we do include a a chart that shows our
 
00:45:10.549 --> 00:45:10.559 align:start position:0%
reduction in in positions over the years
 
00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
so that everybody knows we have worked
 
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
to to become leaner as we've adopted
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
technology better equipment to help us
 
00:45:22.829 --> 00:45:22.839 align:start position:0%
get our jobs done we have already shed
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
the positions that that those
 
00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
efficiencies brought to us we also
 
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
include a line on there that shows
 
00:45:33.069 --> 00:45:33.079 align:start position:0%
vehicle miles traveled so that's the
 
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
total number of of miles that people
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
have traveled on New Hampshire roads and
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
that continues to to climb despite our
 
00:45:44.589 --> 00:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
our fewer
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
people some of our longer term
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
challenges include funding insufficient
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
Highway fund revenues to fund current
 
00:45:56.109 --> 00:45:56.119 align:start position:0%
levels of service lack of matching funds
 
00:45:59.470 --> 00:45:59.480 align:start position:0%
for federally funded projects limited
 
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
State funds for non-federal Aid um
 
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
eligible roads declining toll
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
revenues um or road toll revenues coming
 
00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
from vehicles that have better fuel
 
00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
efficiency and the electric vehicles um
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
and the highway fund as most on this
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
this committee know has had a series of
 
00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:25.839 align:start position:0%
one-time fixes over the years but never
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
any long long-term structural
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
fix little bit on the 10-year plan
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
process that's how we plan our capital
 
00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:38.079 align:start position:0%
projects for the for the future we
 
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
update our 10year plan every two years
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
um we that's a continuous cycle and
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
where we're at with that this April
 
00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:51.160 align:start position:0%
we'll be starting the the public portion
 
00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
of our update of the plan we'll
 
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
incorporate some some recommendations
 
00:46:58.990 --> 00:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
from the Reg planning commissions we'll
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
then work with what we call gaset which
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
is uh the governor and and um executive
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
council's advisory Transportation group
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
um we will get the 10-year plan right
 
00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
for the for the for our executive
 
00:47:17.549 --> 00:47:17.559 align:start position:0%
counselors we will go out last time we
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
had 24 25 public meetings to get
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
feedback on that plan we'll finalize the
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
plan with the executive counselors
 
00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
present it to the governor make any
 
00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
changes that the governor wants and then
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
it will come to the house through your
 
00:47:35.309 --> 00:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
committee and then it will go to the
 
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
Senate and finally back to the the
 
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
governor for
 
00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
Signature hopefully not this spring but
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
the next
 
00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
spring we also want to highlight the New
 
00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Transportation Council this
 
00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
Council was established by New Hampshire
 
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
legislature in
 
00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
2018 it's intended to partner with the
 
00:48:02.109 --> 00:48:02.119 align:start position:0%
do and the the general court and this
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
can be a great place that if you want to
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
have things studied or looked at
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
carefully you could consider referring
 
00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:14.559 align:start position:0%
that to the transportation Council and
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
with that I thank you for your attention
 
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:19.720 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair of your pleasure I'd be
 
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions now but I
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
also do want to continue to keep the
 
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
door open for the future and make sure
 
00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
folks know um we're always here to
 
00:48:32.589 --> 00:48:32.599 align:start position:0%
answer your
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um one thing I
 
00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure everybody understood
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
is although the uh the 10-year plan is
 
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
always always ongoing for
 
00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
doot they'll do all the heavy lifting
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
all the heavy work and they'll pass it
 
00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:51.160 align:start position:0%
over to us next by any not next by any
 
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
the second half of this year correct so
 
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
for our the first half of this year we
 
00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
will be concentrating on the capital
 
00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.510 align:start position:0%
will be concentrating on the capital
budget

00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
hp25 but you're going to keep hearing
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
about the 10-year plan over and over and
 
00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
over again I've already had at least
 
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
three people from various Towns come up
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
to me and ask and you'll you'll be
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
hearing it also ask if they can get this
 
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
on the plan ask if they can move this up
 
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
you know things like that and there's a
 
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
procedure for all of this so just go
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
ahead and ask when you have to uh aside
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
from that uh
 
00:49:28.589 --> 00:49:28.599 align:start position:0%
I have nothing else do we have any
 
00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
questions yes we certainly do
 
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative bone thank you Mr
 
00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
chairman the question I mean we have the
 
00:49:36.789 --> 00:49:36.799 align:start position:0%
same problem in town
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
getting plow operators it used to be
 
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
that was the majority of our plows now
 
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
it's not what do you see is the problem
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
there what do we see is uh is is as is
 
00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:53.960 align:start position:0%
the problem and and you know if I give
 
00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
you an honest answer it's a living wage
 
00:49:59.470 --> 00:49:59.480 align:start position:0%
we need a living wage everything cost of
 
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
everything has has gone up these are are
 
00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
tend to be some of our lower paid paid
 
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
workers um and there's competition for
 
00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
wage representative Jack uh thank you Mr
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
chairman on the long-term funding
 
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
challenges I'd like to highlight the
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
work of the road toll commission uh
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
which is a commission that is charged
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
with develop in a long-term plan to
 
00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
solve the funding challenges and the
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
next meeting of that is scheduled a week
 
00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.510 align:start position:0%
next meeting of that is scheduled a week
from

00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
today that is true do we have any other
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
questions for the dot at this point in
 
00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:43.119 align:start position:0%

have a seat and in every plow truck and
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
we do have incentives to help make sure
 
00:51:35.549 --> 00:51:35.559 align:start position:0%
of that to to help incentivize people
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%

stay with us through the winter so
 
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%

00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
about 140 to 145 winter volunteers who
 
00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
help us out who make up for the 198 or
 
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
so vacancies that that we have um it's
 
00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:19.960 align:start position:0%
important to understand that that's also
 
00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
a 25 247 job we can't fill one shift
 
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
never mind multiple shifts so those
 
00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
people are available when just when we
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
need them to plow snow but for the
 
00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
duration of the storm for our rented
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
equipment we have not not this past year
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%

00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
rented trucks with operator and we also
 
00:52:55.309 --> 00:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
have a system where we pay a 10hour
 
00:52:59.870 --> 00:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
minimum at every two weeks for um 10
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
payments during the winter season that's
 
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure that these these folks have
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
the money to to register Ure and get
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%

00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
actual hours they work and it is an
 
00:53:18.839 --> 00:53:20.710 align:start position:0%
actual hours they work and it is an
hourly

00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none we're just about ready to
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
wrap this up I think uh if there's
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
nothing else further the the do wants to
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
contribute at this time I'd just like to
 
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
ask you to please stay a couple of
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
minutes I got a couple of personal
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
things I've got to talk to you about um
 
00:53:44.349 --> 00:53:44.359 align:start position:0%
I don't know when we're going to
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
schedule our next meeting
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
yet what what I do know is that we will
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
be scheduling almost all of our meetings
 
00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:52.750 align:start position:0%
be scheduling almost all of our meetings
on

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays Wednesdays will definitely be
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
out Wednesdays are Comm committed to uh
 
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
HHS Thursdays uh chairman McDonald and
 
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
myself have agreed that depends on who
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
has the heavy lifting to do that week
 
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
when we have hb25 to start working on
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
we'll be using on some Thursdays uh but
 
00:54:15.789 --> 00:54:15.799 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try and keep most of our
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
normal scheduling to Tuesdays having
 
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
said that next Tuesday is already off
 
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
the calendar as representative Jack said
 
00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:25.240 align:start position:0%
because we've got the road toll
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
commission meeting here and I opt not
 
00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
to have a backtack meeting where we
 
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
would come in at noon and the road to
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
start at 10 o'clock so um just pay
 
00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:39.640 align:start position:0%
attention to your calendars
 
00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:41.549 align:start position:0%

00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
double room commit but that's off the
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
