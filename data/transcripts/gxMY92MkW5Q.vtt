00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
from the hearing with the adjourned
 
00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
resume the adjourned hearing
 
00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1369 relative to covet 19
 
00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 align:start position:0%
health and safety policies at new
 
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire performing arts venues
 
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
substituting for representative wilhelm
 
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
who is prime sponsor is a co-sponsor
 
00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 align:start position:0%
yes um i got a phone call from the prime
 
00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative matt wilhelm
 
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
um as i was driving down that his
 
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
youngest is sick and he's staying home
 
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
with her
 
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
and asked me to pinch it for him i was
 
00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
planning to testify anyway
 
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
um first off i had a little moment of
 
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
dyslexia with the number of what i
 
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
passed around if it still says 1639 that
 
00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 align:start position:0%
is an error i tried to correct it by
 
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
my testimony will be mine with
 
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
some snippets of representative
 
00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
wilhelm's in as well
 
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
so uh what
 
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.630 align:start position:0%
so uh what
uh

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
and there's also an amendment which is
 
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
being passed around at this moment as
 
00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 align:start position:0%
well which i'll come to later on i've
 
00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 align:start position:0%
just gotten an email from him and so i'm
 
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
doing a little bit of multitasking here
 
00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
what 1639 does is it provides the
 
00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
performing arts venues in new hampshire
 
00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 align:start position:0%
have the authority to establish their
 
00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:04.950 align:start position:0%
have the authority to establish their
own

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
coveted health and safety policies it
 
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
does not mandate these policies it
 
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
remains a choice of the business as to
 
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
performing arts venues really operate on
 
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
really thin margins
 
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
so they really cannot afford to
 
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
significantly decrease their capacity to
 
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
be able to maintain social distancing or
 
00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
they just simply can't
 
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
can't function
 
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
so utilization of other mitigation
 
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
strategies such as
 
00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
improved ventilation masking testing
 
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
and or vaccination requirements will
 
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
safely allow them to lessen social
 
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.309 align:start position:0%
safely allow them to lessen social
distancing

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
distancing
 
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
and therefore increase capacity in order
 
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
for them to survive financially
 
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
a november 26 2021 article on lansa
 
00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
demonstrated in a randomized controlled
 
00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:50.470 align:start position:0%
demonstrated in a randomized controlled
trial

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
trial
 
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
the participation in large indoor
 
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.910 align:start position:0%
the participation in large indoor
gatherings

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
gatherings
 
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
without physical distancing
 
00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
did not result in an increase of coveted
 
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
transmission to the attendees
 
00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 align:start position:0%
when a multi-layered risk mitigation
 
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
strategy of ventilation upgrades
 
00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
mandatory medical mask grade wearing
 
00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
medical grade and mask wearing and a
 
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
mandatory pre-admission antigen
 
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
screening was used
 
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
so what hb 1639 does is it will allow
 
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire performing arts venues
 
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
as a business decision
 
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
to implement protocols of masking
 
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
testing and or vaccination requirements
 
00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 align:start position:0%
for patrons in order to improve the
 
00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 align:start position:0%
safety of patrons and employees
 
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
they are businesses and should be
 
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
allowed to implement protocols
 
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
for employee and patron safety
 
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
if desired again this does not mandate
 
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
they must do this it gives them a choice
 
00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
as a business
 
00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.350 align:start position:0%
as a business
also

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 align:start position:0%
these protocols could really be a
 
00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.070 align:start position:0%
these protocols could really be a
marketing

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
marketing
 
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the venue
 
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
a venue may choose to advertise that
 
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
they can that they implement such
 
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.030 align:start position:0%
they can that they implement such
protocols

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
protocols
 
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
to set them apart as a venue which cares
 
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
for the safety of patrons and employees
 
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
and many patrons may feel more
 
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
comfortable attending a performance when
 
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
they know their safety
 
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
is being considered
 
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
remember that about 68 68 percent of new
 
00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents have been vaccinated
 
00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
that means the majority would like to be
 
00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.189 align:start position:0%
that means the majority would like to be
safe

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
safe
 
00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
the venues should be allowed to market
 
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
their commitment to safety
 
00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
to that majority of individuals who have
 
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
demonstrated they care
 
00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
about their safety and this mattered
 
00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 align:start position:0%
certainly i know to me and to some
 
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
friends of mine going over to still
 
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
martin art center in maine who did have
 
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
mask requirements then a vaccine mandate
 
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
that you'd feel more comfortable going
 
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.629 align:start position:0%
that you'd feel more comfortable going
there

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
back when things were a little quieter
 
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
now it also suggests that you would
 
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
review the testimony
 
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
that was sent out back when this bill
 
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
was originally scheduled do remember
 
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
this was scheduled before which is why
 
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
you may have two copies of my testimony
 
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
because i distribute it but i did it
 
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
again today because if you're like many
 
00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
of us it might got lost in the shuffle
 
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
but bill marsh about that time had uh
 
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
emailed his testimony and remember he
 
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
served on the governor's economic
 
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
reopening task force and worked on the
 
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
protocols for performing arts venues so
 
00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 align:start position:0%
he's got a unique view
 
00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
now what uh the prime sponsors
 
00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 align:start position:0%
conveyed to me
 
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh is that after finding this bill there
 
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
was a great deal of concern
 
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
about the language
 
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.870 align:start position:0%
about the language
in

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
lines eight
 
00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:21.270 align:start position:0%
lines eight
through

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.310 align:start position:0%
through
ten

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
ten
 
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
which says that any person acting in
 
00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 align:start position:0%
good faith to administer or enforce
 
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
at performing venues covered 19 health
 
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
and safety policy shall be immune from
 
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
civil liability arising from such
 
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.909 align:start position:0%
civil liability arising from such
conduct

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
the legislative intention of that
 
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
was that a
 
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
employee would not be sued because they
 
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
asked a person to
 
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
demonstrate proof of vaccination before
 
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
being admitted so as to protect them
 
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
not from medical issues or anything else
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
but simply to protect them from
 
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.870 align:start position:0%
but simply to protect them from
being

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
sued for
 
00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
implementing the policy
 
00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
but there was a lot of blowback and
 
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
there's apparently been no cases of any
 
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
that have been brought in this
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
and as a result the sponsor feels that
 
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh the immunity language may have been a
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
little bit too broad
 
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
might be able to be used as a general
 
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
liability shield that had been expressed
 
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
to him as after filing the bill
 
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.909 align:start position:0%
to him as after filing the bill
and

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.189 align:start position:0%
and
therefore

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:21.990 align:start position:0%
therefore
um

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
if they for example if a promoter i'm
 
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
gonna i'm reading from his email on my
 
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
apologies because i did not get a chance
 
00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 align:start position:0%
to process this if a concert promoter
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
asserted that its policy was that they
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
don't require masks they jam people into
 
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
a venue unsafely and act negligent
 
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
negligent in theirs
 
00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 align:start position:0%
negligently and there are infections
 
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
might somebody try to use that language
 
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
as a shield well that doesn't make any
 
00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
sense either
 
00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
so the bottom line is that he has
 
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
given an amendment which
 
00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 align:start position:0%
i did not have hands on until just this
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
a little while ago it's been passed
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
around which is a replace all for
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
section one and what it does is it just
 
00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.510 align:start position:0%
section one and what it does is it just
removes

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
removes
 
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
the language of lines 8 through 10 about
 
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
the liability he's perfectly happy with
 
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.670 align:start position:0%
the liability he's perfectly happy with
that

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
lastly is he had a conversation with
 
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
abby rogers of dhhs
 
00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:13.759 align:start position:0%
and dhhs feels that this probably should
 
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
not be placed in statute 141c16
 
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
because it's that it shouldn't be in the
 
00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
communicable disease statute but instead
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
in some
 
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
statutory reference in commerce but we
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
all know in this committee we've dealt
 
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
with multiple
 
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh changes that need to be made for
 
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
statutory low f statutory home and so we
 
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
can certainly deal with that but we'd
 
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
have to figure out where it would belong
 
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
so with that i'd be glad to take any
 
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:43.749 align:start position:0%
so with that i'd be glad to take any
questions

00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
would you need to
 
00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:47.110 align:start position:0%
would you need to
uh

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
bring an amendment to us to change the
 
00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:52.879 align:start position:0%
statutory reference before we
 
00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
exact okay yes apparently this was uh
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
this conversation had occurred
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
relatively recently and we do not yet
 
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.309 align:start position:0%
relatively recently and we do not yet
know

00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
so although we do have this amendment if
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
we are going to change the location and
 
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
i do not know if dhhs plans to testify
 
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
for clarity um but any maybe they could
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
if they wish to do so but in any case we
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
would then want to draft a new amendment
 
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
to be able to take care of that
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh to answer your question
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
representative canaric the honorable
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%

pink card and looks like he's about
 
00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
ready to use it so yes and uh since
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%

yes
 
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
if if you if if the testimony goes that
 
00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:37.430 align:start position:0%
if if you if if the testimony goes that
way

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
could you prepare that amendment to
 
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.080 align:start position:0%

and uh
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's as everyone in this room knows
 
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
the palace was then closed
 
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
after that for about 15 months it cost
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
us about 7.5 million dollars um
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
we laid off about 50 artists
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
of all sorts of types and
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
so um i had spoken representative
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
wilhelm who's my representative now
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
a bunch of us in the theater business
 
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
across new hampshire
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
there are 14
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
historic uh performing arts centers in
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and there are about 50
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
performing arts centers all sorts of uh
 
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
from 100 seats up to
 
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.910 align:start position:0%
from 100 seats up to
uh

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
up to snhu arena which had 10 000 seats
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
so about 60 total ones every one is
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
different and uh they're all run
 
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
differently and i think today you're
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
going to hear from two operators one in
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
uh two in concord one in claremont and
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
they will all tell you different stories
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
but the point of it is
 
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
that every
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
every act that comes into the palace
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
that we hire uh
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
for example wednesday night we have
 
00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
the the famous um uh
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps the most famous person in new
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
hampshire seth meyers
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
is coming to the palace theater
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
wednesday night we are sold out and he
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
has said to me
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
well i'm proud to come i'm proud to
 
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.310 align:start position:0%
well i'm proud to come i'm proud to
perform

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
perform
 
00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
but i would like everybody in the venue
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
to have a mask
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
so i say well i'd love to have you come
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
and i will ask everyone to be there the
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
challenge as you all know is how do you
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
enforce it i do not want to be a police
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
officer so i go up to people and say can
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
you please put your mask on and they say
 
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
go to hell ramsay and i say thank you
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
very much and if they're obnoxious i'll
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
call the police
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
but it's it's really been very difficult
 
00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
but it's almost illogical to think that
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
we as a society want performing arts
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
centers in our state and
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
and not allow them to run the venues how
 
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
they have to run them
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
and economically it makes a tremendous
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
difference the palace theater generates
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
about 10 million dollars a year in
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
economic activity downtown it's real
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
money that goes to to salaries to
 
00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:09.430 align:start position:0%
money that goes to to salaries to
restaurants

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
to lawyers
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
there are 10 restaurants within one
 
00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
block of the palace theater
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
it's a tremendous economic activity we
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
need our performing arts centers to
 
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
operate the capital center for the arts
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's a wonderful institution we need it
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
in concord and the new one in nashua
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
is going to change downtown nashua
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
immediately and we need to let them run
 
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
how they should run so i could go on for
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
hours i will not
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%

00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
and then my follow-up would have been is
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
there a ticket for less than 24.99
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%

00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
committee good morning i'm john williams
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
the legislative director for the
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
department of health human services and
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
here today on behalf of miss abby rogers
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to provide you with
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
the thought in terms of statutory
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
placement the
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
currently it is housed under 141c our
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be to to
 
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
create and establish a new chapter a
 
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.189 align:start position:0%
create and establish a new chapter a
chapter

00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
359 dash uppercase t to follow current
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
existing um chapter
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
359 dash
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
r rt or rs ss rather just have to do the
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
alphabet a little more carefully on a
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
monday morning
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
and our suggestion is because that falls
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
under the titles that deal with commerce
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh clearly performing arts centers do a
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
wonderful job but they should not be
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
regulated by the department of health
 
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
and services and our suggestion would be
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
to placing it under the commerce statute
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
in a more cleaner
 
00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
place if this bill were to go forward
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
that completes our commentary on the
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
bill and thank you for your time thank
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%

bill

00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
i am pleased to hear representative
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
come forward with an amendment that
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
would remove
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
the provision for
 
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
immunity from liability of course that
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
was one of my concerns
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
any time an employer who imposes a
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
mandate on employees must be held
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
accountable and liable for any and all
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
harm that results from their mandate
 
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
they don't get to cause an injury or
 
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
death to others without consequence
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
and so there should be liability and
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
there there would be and
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not there is a provision in
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
law to mandate these vaccines we have
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
some seen some employers
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
excuse me take it upon themselves to
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
mandate coveted shots in indeed um they
 
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
are not protected from immunity they
 
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
have no immunity from liability under
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
the prep act um and they have no
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
immunity from liability under the 1986
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
national childhood vaccine injury act um
 
00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:05.039 align:start position:0%
when they impose vaccine mandates of
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
their own volition they do assume
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
liability for that and i urge any
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
employees that are injured by such
 
00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:11.750 align:start position:0%
employees that are injured by such
employ

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
employ
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh mandates to please file their workers
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
compensation claim and know that they
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
would have civil liability
 
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
these vaccines are not without risk and
 
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.750 align:start position:0%
these vaccines are not without risk and
harm

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
harm
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
to look up in the
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
vaccine safety database
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
used by the cdc in the fda we see that
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
there have been reported over 23 000
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
deaths following coveted shots or 124
 
00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations of
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
116 000 urgent care
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
the list goes goes on and on so we do
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
know that people can be injured by these
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
shots i do know that this bill provides
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
no provision for any exemptions for
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
medical reasons religious reasons or
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
personal reasons
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
in addition there is no and there could
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
be you know people such as you know
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
women that are are pregnant um that
 
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
don't wish to be vaccinated wish to
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
protect their their unborn baby from
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
harm from vaccines so there's a whole
 
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons why someone might
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
wish to certain exemption this bill
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
makes no provision for that
 
00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.750 align:start position:0%
makes no provision for that
um

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
and in that way it is discriminatory
 
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
against those who um would choose to
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
protect themselves from vaccines for
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
whatever reason and the bill also does
 
00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
not contain any provision for natural
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
immunity against coven 19 despite the
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
overwhelming evidence of natural
 
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
immunity being equal to or better than
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
vaccination so makes no provision for
 
00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:43.669 align:start position:0%
vaccination so makes no provision for
that

00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:44.630 align:start position:0%
that
and

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
i will note that it recently came up in
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
the news that um you know when you look
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
at workplace mandates it was an indiana
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
life insurance company
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
that reported that deaths are up some 40
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
amongst working people ages 18 to 64.
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
and they noted that these are not
 
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.070 align:start position:0%
and they noted that these are not
covades

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
covades
 
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
disabilities are also up in the short
 
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
term and now long term
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
so we need to be aware that these
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
vaccines are not not without risk and i
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
urge you to please recommend this bill
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
as inexpedient to legislate
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman also thank you for
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
how is
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
requirement it doesn't say you have to
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
be vaccinated it just says you have to
 
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
have either a test you have to have a
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
mask or other things to do to protect
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
the performers
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
how is this different than an employer
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
saying if you don't have a shirt i don't
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
have shoes on you can't come into my
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
establishment how is that different oh
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
that's really easy
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
a shirt and shoes
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
is something that um you could put on
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
and take off and it has no
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
no abs no adverse effect
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
to um wearing a shirt or shoes you know
 
00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
i don't see that there's any sort of
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
shirt and shoes um data safety program
 
00:20:08.789 --> 00:20:08.799 align:start position:0%
to to monitor the adverse effects and
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
the deaths of wearing shirts and shoes
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines are quite different
 
00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
we do know that vaccines do sicken
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you very
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
much ms condon for taking my question
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
the rights
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
just as
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
you argue for the rights of those who
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
do you not concede
 
00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.590 align:start position:0%
do you not concede
that

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
there are other people in this state who
 
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
do not agree with you
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
and just as
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
you should be able to choose not to get
 
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.630 align:start position:0%
you should be able to choose not to get
vaccinated

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
other people might need
 
00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:05.919 align:start position:0%
might want to choose
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
to patronize events
 
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
just as you feel unsafe
 
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
with a vaccination
 
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't those who have a different
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
choice made in their lives
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
have the choice
 
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.750 align:start position:0%
have the choice
to

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
choose to patronize an establishment
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
that has established policies that they
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and i do
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
recognize that there is a difference of
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
opinions on this issue very much so
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
recognize that
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
but i follow the science
 
00:21:49.039 --> 00:21:50.070 align:start position:0%
but i follow the science
and

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
the science shows that covid vaccines
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
do carry risks they carry risk of
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
illness disability and death
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
the science also shows that these
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
coveted shots were never designed to
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
prevent infection or prevent spread to
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
the patrons sitting next to you at the
 
00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.350 align:start position:0%
the patrons sitting next to you at the
theater

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
theater
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
they were designed from the get-go and i
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
do attend the advisory committee on
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
immunization practice meetings those are
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
live webinars anybody can watch those
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
and it was discussed from the from the
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
get-go and the manufacturers volunteered
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
themselves and you will find it on the
 
00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.149 align:start position:0%
themselves and you will find it on the
manufacturer's

00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturer's
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
fact sheet that they provide with these
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
ua shots is that these vaccines are not
 
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
designed to prevent infection they're
 
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
designed to reduce symptoms similar to
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
someone who might take say nyquil for a
 
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.190 align:start position:0%
someone who might take say nyquil for a
cold

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
cold
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
someone taking a shot to reduce their
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
illness symptoms in no way impacts the
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
patrons sitting next to them at the
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
theater thank you very much for your
 
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
question and the opportunity to address
 
00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.310 align:start position:0%
question and the opportunity to address
it

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
i have a question i'm a sometime
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
performing artist
 
00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.630 align:start position:0%
performing artist
and

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
if i chose
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
to give an organ recital again
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
that would be my choice
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
if peop and if i set policies as to
 
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
the people coming to my organ recital or
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
if the facility for which i'm giving an
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
organ recital chose to do it the sad
 
00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:24.070 align:start position:0%
organ recital chose to do it the sad
truth

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
truth
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
is going to an organ recital is not a
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
necessity of life
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
but there are places that are
 
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.710 align:start position:0%
but there are places that are
and

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
i think this conversation in my opinion
 
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
would belong in those places that are
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
necessities of life
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
if you want to go to an organ recital
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
because of the terms the church or
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
concert hall are setting that's on you
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
if you don't want to go that's on you
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
and i've had to wrestle with this
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
because there's a possibility of me
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
again giving a recital and would i be
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
comfortable doing that or not it is
 
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
sadly not a necessity of life so my
 
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
is the testimony against this bill
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
better directed towards only those
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and and i
 
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
agree that performing arts venues are
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
not a necessity of life and um it
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
strikes my heart the same way it does
 
00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:29.919 align:start position:0%
you so because i am a music fan as well
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
so um but you know those who wish to um
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
and feel they need to
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
and believe it it would keep them safe
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
that there's no requirement that they
 
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
attend those performances so i do agree
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
with you um on that point so you
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
your question is
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
if i can understand it correctly is that
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
you you would seek to impose a vaccine
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
requirement on
 
00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.669 align:start position:0%
requirement on
other

00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
facilities that are a requirement
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
to be there that is not my intent okay
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
my intent is simply to carve out
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
non-necessities of life
 
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
and therefore is it not
 
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
the right
 
00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
for the people
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
performing for the performing
 
00:25:21.669 --> 00:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
venue people and for the attenders to
 
00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
decide which they want to do
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
well i do believe in choice and if
 
00:25:28.149 --> 00:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
you're if you're asking if i believe
 
00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
people should be able to decide for
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
themselves yes i guess i'm still unclear
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
on your question
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
what you would be carving out
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what an essential business
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
is i mean i can assure you that
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
everybody employed at the the palace
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
theater um believes that their job is
 
00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
essential to them it pays their their
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
bills it puts a roof over their head it
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
puts food on their table and provides
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
for their children so i think they would
 
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
see that their job is essential
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's kind of
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to boil it down would you
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
have a problem with this bill
 
00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.070 align:start position:0%
have a problem with this bill
if

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirements were struck
 
00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.390 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirements were struck
because

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
that would still allow requiring the
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
mask requiring tests but
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
yes i shouldn't give my opinion i want
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
and that was a good point about it's
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
pretty essential to the people who work
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
there and certainly
 
00:26:41.909 --> 00:26:41.919 align:start position:0%
i'm guessing that they would not want to
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
put restrictions on that would reduce
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
their audience
 
00:26:46.799 --> 00:26:47.750 align:start position:0%
their audience
right

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.870 align:start position:0%
right
um

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
so your question is is you know is is
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
this a bill i would still object to if
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
they they took out on the provision
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
of vaccines and and you know allowed
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
employers to impose any other
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
requirements i suppose mask distancing
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't know what they you know
 
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
hand washing
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
you know hand washing is a good thing
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to object to that one um
 
00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:14.799 align:start position:0%
you know whatever that they'll say they
 
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
might impose um
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know again and i think it was um mr
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
ramsey who spoke to this um there is no
 
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism here i still think
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
it puts businesses in the same position
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
and i don't object to that if a business
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
would prefer that people wear masks and
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
socially distance i don't object to
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
those signs that say we recommend we
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
would like you to
 
00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
um that's that's a polite request and i
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
i don't object to those
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
but um i think you know to
 
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
put it into law i i think still puts
 
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
these business owners and and patrons
 
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
and employees still in an awkward
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
very much thank you chair recognizes
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chair thank you
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
committee members um
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
i um
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
on the good news is i feel our public
 
00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:26.549 align:start position:0%
on the good news is i feel our public
arts

00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
arts
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
public performing places is an essential
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility if we look at what's
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
happened to our society just with
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
regards to depression and things like
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
that music fills the soul
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
music makes you want to go wake up the
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
next day so i would argue that our
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
public our performing arts centers are
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
essential they're essential to our
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
health mental health and well-being um
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
that being said um
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
i understand the intent of this bill and
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
i respect it
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
however the bottom line is this bill is
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
a further form of discrimination against
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
the citizens of the un the unvaccinated
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
versus the vaccinated discrimination is
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
discrimination regardless
 
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
i am
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated because i am vaccine
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
injured i cannot take the vaccine at
 
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
this time so i may not be able to go
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
someplace and it's happened it's
 
00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
happened more than once
 
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
so that's discrimination um with regards
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
to testing i have tested four times
 
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
because of the job that i had
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
every time within a six-month period i
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
tested positive for covert 19. these
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
tests are not accurate so the fact that
 
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
you put a testing requirement in here
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
i will never be able i may never be able
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
to go to a performing arts venue again
 
00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.750 align:start position:0%
to go to a performing arts venue again
um

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh you spoke you asked questions with
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
regards to
 
00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.029 align:start position:0%
regards to
um

00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
seth meyers coming to the palace the
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
good news is there's still 27 seats
 
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.149 align:start position:0%
good news is there's still 27 seats
available

00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
the bad news is they don't come anywhere
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
near 30 under 30 dollars
 
00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.269 align:start position:0%
near 30 under 30 dollars
um

00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
and that being said there are a number
 
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
of people who
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
have now been told that seth meyers is
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
requesting a mask
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
to be at his performance to be at his
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
performance you must wear a mask there
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
are now over um on his website there are
 
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.789 align:start position:0%
are now over um on his website there are
now

00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:25.799 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
152 complaints saying they want their
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
money they want to be refunded because
 
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:32.799 align:start position:0%
they're not going to they're not going
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
to they choose not to spend their money
 
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
on an artist that is going to put those
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
kind of implementations on them so that
 
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
is a perfect example right there it's
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
freedom of choice
 
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
i was one of those persons that spent
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
125 dollars for a ticket to see seth
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
meyers wednesday night
 
00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
i chose i will choose to not go
 
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
even if i can't sell my ticket
 
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
and that's what freedom of choice is
 
00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.630 align:start position:0%
and that's what freedom of choice is
about

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
now the only other thing is i do agree
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
that private businesses should be able
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
to make their own private decisions for
 
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
what's best for their
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
business and for what's best for their
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
um for their establishment however
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
if they receive any kind of public
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
funding whatsoever
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
they should not be able to put in
 
00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:25.830 align:start position:0%
they should not be able to put in
special

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
special
 
00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.789 align:start position:0%
special
so

00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
i am not a hundred percent opposed to
 
00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.149 align:start position:0%
i am not a hundred percent opposed to
this

00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
other than the vaccine issue um
 
00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:33.830 align:start position:0%
other than the vaccine issue um
but

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
if they i will choose not to
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
um attend any performance that requires
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
masking social or not social disc
 
00:31:45.909 --> 00:31:45.919 align:start position:0%
probably not even masking i will choose
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
not to attend any event that requires
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
vaccines or vaccine passports or vaccine
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
testing because i know ultimately i will
 
00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:56.950 align:start position:0%
testing because i know ultimately i will
fail

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
fail
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if you folks are like
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
me but i don't like to fail so i will
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
just choose not to participate
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
would you choose to take away seth
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
meyer's right to choose
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely not
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
and seth meyers like i said my issue
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
is the fact that he's not taking public
 
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
money to perform he can choose
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you but the palace theater if
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
they're taking public funding they
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
should not be able to put a policy in
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
place that's all i'm saying thank you
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%

00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
from the capital center for the arts i
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman pearson and
 
00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
my name is salvatore prizio from the
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
capital center for the arts i have been
 
00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:55.039 align:start position:0%
a citizen of new hampshire now for
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
nine weeks so
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
yes and this is the first time i'm
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
speaking in front of a committee so
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
forgive me for any faux pas that i do
 
00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.350 align:start position:0%
forgive me for any faux pas that i do
here

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
um i do have some prepared remarks um
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
but one of the things i do want to say
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
at the outset is i want everybody to
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
consider this from a macro standpoint as
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
opposed to the micro standpoint of just
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
what we're dealing with in this room
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
on a day-to-day basis my colleagues and
 
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
i deal with agents that are in
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
california new york nashville tennessee
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
i mean all over the country
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
they have artists of varying degrees of
 
00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
restrictions and safety protocols that
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
they put in place on us to a certain
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
extent now all of us at our performing
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
arts centers try to do the best that we
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
can do to protect the people that come
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
into our spaces but sometimes it is an
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
outside force that is asking us to put
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
restrictions in place
 
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
if we are not allowed to
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
put any of the restrictions in place
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
that the artists are having
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
ask us to do
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
essentially what you would have happen
 
00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
is an entertainment i don't want to call
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
it a boycott but
 
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
you would have a lot of artists avoiding
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire because we
 
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
aren't allowed to put in place some of
 
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
the safety protocols they're asking us
 
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
do we agree with all of them it depends
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
it depends on your performing arts
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
center it depends on the rates of
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
infection in your area
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
it's the reason why
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
we want to have the ability
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
of ourselves to make the decisions look
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
none of us in the performing arts
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
business want to be in the medical field
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
i didn't do this i didn't become a i
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
didn't get my md degree
 
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
or anything like that to
 
00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
you know sit up here and and have
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
conversations about medical practices
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
but this is the reality of the position
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
that we're in and i can tell you
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
like again i've been on the job here
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
eight weeks
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
our entire january got wiped out because
 
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
of covid all right so zero dollars in
 
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
earned revenue over the capital center
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
for the arts so i have to deal with
 
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
those realities on a day-to-day basis
 
00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.589 align:start position:0%
those realities on a day-to-day basis
so

00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
i'm having constant conversations with
 
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
representatives in our membership
 
00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.430 align:start position:0%
representatives in our membership
committee

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
and the more safety protocols we put in
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
place the more people are feeling safe
 
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
to come out
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
if there's things that i can do in a
 
00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
responsible manner
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
as much as possible to make people feel
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
safe in their spaces i'm going to do it
 
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
as long as it's legally viable
 
00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.270 align:start position:0%
as long as it's legally viable
um

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
i also wanted to say uh we so like i
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
said we've lost 40 of that uh i should
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
say our ticket sales have been off 40
 
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
so in the midst of a pandemic we're
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
trying to get back to doing the business
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
of what we do best which is entertaining
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
the people of the capital here
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
and to that end we performing arts
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
centers like the capital center for the
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
arts were knocked to their knees and
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
we're desperately trying to get back on
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
our feet so if there's any tools that we
 
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
can use at our disposal to allow us to
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
get back up on our feet we're struggling
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
so hard to do so and
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
we just want the rights
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
and the ability to put some of these
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
safety protocols in place
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
do we want them there forever absolutely
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
not who wants to go to a comedy show
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
with a mask on your face it's not ideal
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
but we're trying to do things we're
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
trying to fit square pegs and round
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
holes at the moment to get us through so
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
we can get to a place where we can all
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
take our masks off again and feel safe
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
i respect the rights of others and their
 
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
decisions that they want to make but i'm
 
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
trying to do what's best for the the
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
crowds that come into our space
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
um uh what i was gonna say uh
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
so after that and when
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
if we have those abilities it allows us
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
to kind of assess on a show-by-show
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
basis per the artist's request for the
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
safety of everybody that we have
 
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
involved i'm thank you in advance for
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
voting ought to pass on hb 1369 and
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing the arts businesses in the
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
granite state the ability to protect
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
their artists employees and audiences as
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
the way they see fit i'm happy to answer
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
i'll ask the same question that was
 
00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.829 align:start position:0%
i'll ask the same question that was
asked

00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
asked
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
before and that is would you support
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
this bill if
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
we removed the vaccine requirement
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
the problem with removing the vaccine
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
requirement is any artist that comes
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
into our space that has a vaccine
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
requirement attached to it now all of a
 
00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
sudden we lose that artist we lose them
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
to to massachusetts we're going to lose
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
them to maine
 
00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.030 align:start position:0%
them to maine
vermont

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
you know all these other places i mean
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
look at the end of the day it's a
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
competitive market and we need to do
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
what we can do to be competitive within
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
that market
 
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.829 align:start position:0%
that market
follow-up

00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
taking these questions
 
00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.150 align:start position:0%
taking these questions
so

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.510 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
i guess on a business sense do you agree
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
that this is
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
you're going after 68 of the market
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
since 32 percent of the people won't
 
00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:51.349 align:start position:0%
since 32 percent of the people won't
come

00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
i would say this i would say uh
 
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
within the you're saying you're looking
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
at that 68 and 32
 
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
as the entire total population
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
if i have to look at it as the people
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
who regularly attend
 
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
my performing arts center
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
those numbers are probably much bigger
 
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
than a 68 32 split
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
not to say that i would ever eliminate
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
the 32 percent
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
i just and you also have to keep in mind
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
too this is on a show by show basis over
 
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
at the the capitol center for the arts
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
we do have a mask mandate in place for
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
all of our shows right now
 
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
but something like you said like a
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate again on a show-by-show
 
00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.150 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate again on a show-by-show
basis

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
basis
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh there are shows that don't require a
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate and those people who
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
refuse to who do not want to get the
 
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine are more than welcome to come to
 
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
those shows
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you that helps yep
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you for
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question are you going to
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
advertise or have you already advertised
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
the artist's requirements
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
for every single show we have listed on
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
our website it has what that shows
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
requirements are
 
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
we always put that out in advance
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
um and the the patron is aware of that
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
in advance of purchasing their ticket
 
00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.069 align:start position:0%
in advance of purchasing their ticket
follow-up

00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh would you possibly just figure that
 
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
as the policy goes
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
you will make decisions based on your
 
00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:21.109 align:start position:0%
you will make decisions based on your
audience

00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry can you clarify the question
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
there how can i say it uh
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
you're you're a business as well as
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
being an artist you have to be a
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
businessman and figure out how you're
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
going to pay for everything absolutely
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm going to
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
guess and you can this is a question
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
yeah of course
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
will you
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
be flexible with your requirements as
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
you see how the audience responds if you
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
see a drop
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
in you know your breakeven number of
 
00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.230 align:start position:0%
in you know your breakeven number of
attendees

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
attendees
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
then i'm going to guess that you well of
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
course i mean any reassess your
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
requirements of course over time listen
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
as this pandemic you know subsides
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
hopefully someday um obviously we'll go
 
00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
back in and review our our policies on
 
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
things and and when i got here it was a
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
mask optional and then we started
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
getting into the omicron variant and i i
 
00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
modified it to be uh mask required
 
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
as the numbers drop and we get to a
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
place where we're safe for gatherings
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
again it'll go back to mask optional
 
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
again you know so it's like we have to
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
be we have to have the ability to adapt
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
to these things as we proceed
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry thanks for taking my question
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
of course thank you
 
00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.390 align:start position:0%
of course thank you
um

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.470 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
if you're able to
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
not mandate but require
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
a mask
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
for whatever performance they say seth
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
meyers comes in and says hey you've got
 
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
to be i want people vaccinated
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
can't you at this point just as well as
 
00:40:59.119 --> 00:41:00.150 align:start position:0%
can't you at this point just as well as
as

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
requiring masks for the performance
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
can't you just require at this point
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
vaccines and then the audience is you
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
know i i don't know
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm a little confused about
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
that all right um so i think what you're
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
saying i think what you're saying is
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
should we just have a vaccine required
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
for every single show that we do no okay
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
so just uh just for your specific show
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
so so the example is seth myers comes in
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
says not only do i want masks but i want
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
people to be vaccinated so now you put
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
that on your site you say okay this
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
these are the requirements for this
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
particular show can you do that now
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
that's what we do that's what we do now
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
then i don't okay
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you for that for
 
00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
where did you come here from
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh schenectady new york
 
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
so you're used to snow oh yeah yeah okay
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
we actually have more sunny days here
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
than upstate new york so
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%

i founded hatbox theater here in concord
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
in 2016 a little cooperative theater
 
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
venue and
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
as a result of the pandemic i had to
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
leave my full-time performance career of
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
30 years
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
and take
 
00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
a position as the executive director of
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
the claremont opera house a
 
00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:03.510 align:start position:0%
the claremont opera house a
not-for-profit

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh venue that is in a municipal uh owned
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
building in claremont and
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
i've had the great opportunity over the
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
years to perform in over a thousand
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
venues throughout the northeast and i've
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
never seen anything like this um it's a
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
huge struggle for not only the venues
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
but the artists
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
and their families and the people who
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
work in the venues
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
that help to bring performances to
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
the their communities
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
over the last 22 months we've seen
 
00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
significant declines in revenue and even
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
in operation at all some of our venues
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
were closed for seven months or more and
 
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
some of us have still operating with 70
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
to 90 percent earned revenue loss
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
the ability to make
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
prudent safety choices as businesses is
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
vital to our continued survival
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
um one of the biggest things is the
 
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
ability to be able to get people to come
 
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
out to a venue and while i am a firm
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
believer of supporting the individual's
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
right to choose
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
that choice is often
 
00:44:14.319 --> 00:44:15.670 align:start position:0%
that choice is often
influenced

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
influenced
 
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
by the conditions on the ground whether
 
00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:18.950 align:start position:0%
by the conditions on the ground whether
it's

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
the transmission rates at the time or
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's the safety procedures that are in
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
whatever location they wish to go if
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
they wish to go to the grocery store
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
they may choose to go to a grocery store
 
00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:29.910 align:start position:0%
they may choose to go to a grocery store
that

00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
that requires masks as opposed to
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
encourages mass or that
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
god forbid one that doesn't have any
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
mask policy whatsoever and i think it's
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
important for the individuals to be able
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
to choose and they do that with their
 
00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.230 align:start position:0%
to choose and they do that with their
feet

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
feet
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh and i think that's important to note
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
that's why this is such an important
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
aspect of running performing arts venues
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
and while
 
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the argument or discussion
 
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
about whether the performing arts are a
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
necessity i'm not really going to get
 
00:44:59.589 --> 00:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
into that because better points have
 
00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
been raised
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
at this point but one thing that a lot
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
of people do not realize and this is why
 
00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
we need your help
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
is that the public do not understand
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
the business of running a performing
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
arts venue most people think of a
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
business that they go and attend as
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
something like the grocery store where
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
they walk in they spend 15 minutes
 
00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:23.839 align:start position:0%
loading their cart or 47 as my wife does
 
00:45:23.839 --> 00:45:24.630 align:start position:0%
loading their cart or 47 as my wife does
um

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
loading their cart and then they leave
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
it's a transactional experience where
 
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
people come in they do their business
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
and they leave performing arts venues
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
all we do and in our letter here is to
 
00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
we share
 
00:45:36.319 --> 00:45:37.750 align:start position:0%
we share
story

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
story
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
sorry through experience and we do that
 
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
by sharing the same room and the same
 
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
space for a duration of time that
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
exceeds that
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
of most normal transactions that people
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
conduct business
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
um in their day-to-day lives
 
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.510 align:start position:0%
um in their day-to-day lives
so

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
we have been impacted far greater in
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
lots of ways than many
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
other commercial organizations whether
 
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
you're not for profit or for a profit
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
organization we've had significant
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
impact and
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
as has been said we were among the first
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
to close and we're going to be the last
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
to reopen we are open but a lot of
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
people think that we're open just like
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
we were before because the grocery store
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
is open like they were before
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
the liquor store you can go and get your
 
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
liquor without a problem nothing has
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
appeared to change but the
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
type of experience
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
when people come to experience the
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
performing arts and have that cathartic
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
experience to learn something to feel
 
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
something and let's face it to
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
be exposed to the ex free exchange of
 
00:46:40.319 --> 00:46:41.670 align:start position:0%
be exposed to the ex free exchange of
ideas

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
ideas
 
00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
we don't have the town square anymore
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
that people walk into and they exchange
 
00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
their ideas
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
the performing arts are one way for
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
people to be exposed to things that may
 
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
change their lives and the lives of
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
their families so at any rate i think i
 
00:46:59.589 --> 00:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
would uh ask that you vote ought to pass
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1369 uh i truly appreciate
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
your interest and uh
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
we'll be happy to answer questions any
 
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
questions that may arise representative
 
00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.069 align:start position:0%
questions that may arise representative
kelsey

00:47:12.069 --> 00:47:12.079 align:start position:0%
kelsey
 
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify um we you you can
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
already require require all of these
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
measures correct
 
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
currently we base our decisions on what
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
happens on the ground in front of us the
 
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
biggest challenge as i alluded to is
 
00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
that we need governmental support in
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
suggesting that this is an important and
 
00:47:37.829 --> 00:47:37.839 align:start position:0%
necessity function of our business if
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
you say it is not
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
by not passing this you're in essence
 
00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
telling our potential customers that we
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
don't have the right to make these
 
00:47:46.079 --> 00:47:47.349 align:start position:0%
don't have the right to make these
choices

00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
choices
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
follow-up okay so basically you want you
 
00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
want this in statute as an enforcement
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism then
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate the
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
support that we have the capability of
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
doing this enforcement as we experienced
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
in the last 22 months has been a sticky
 
00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:06.950 align:start position:0%
in the last 22 months has been a sticky
wicket

00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
wicket
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
during when we had regulations that were
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
supposed to be enforced by the
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
government they were not and individual
 
00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:14.559 align:start position:0%
businesses were left
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
on their own to attempt to
 
00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.670 align:start position:0%
on their own to attempt to
[Music]

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:19.030 align:start position:0%
[Music]
enforce

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
regulations that were being given
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
through emergency orders and things of
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
that nature and there was mixed
 
00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.589 align:start position:0%
that nature and there was mixed
messaging

00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
messaging
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
to the community about what we're
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
allowed to do and what we were not
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to do which resulted in
 
00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:32.230 align:start position:0%
allowed to do which resulted in
confrontation

00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
confrontation
 
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
people who chose to come out to a
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
concert and use that as their
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
independent opportunity to create a
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
scene when that was not the purpose of
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
the event it was but because there was
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
no clear
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
support from the government saying that
 
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
this is well within the rights of their
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
businesses please let them conduct their
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
businesses i think that it's important i
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
would clarify that the language that's
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
in the bill however does give some
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
people the understanding that these
 
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
requirements all of these requirements
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
will be applied and i think the language
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
could be adjusted to include such safety
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
protocols as and that would leave it up
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
to the business it would not be a state
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
mandate of all or nothing i think that's
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
a very important distinction that may
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
help us wage some concerns of the public
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of enforcement
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative king
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm still hung up on the whole
 
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
vaccine thing
 
00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
being in this bill
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh how would you
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
how would you police that number one
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
and number two
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
what if somebody has natural immunity
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
which we have heard earlier before is
 
00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.030 align:start position:0%
which we have heard earlier before is
sufficient

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you i appreciate the question uh
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
and i'd actually like to respond to one
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
of your early questions as well
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of how we implement it now
 
00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.950 align:start position:0%
in terms of how we implement it now
the

00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:05.589 --> 00:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
our patrons are given different options
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
so if they choose not to be vaccinated
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
one of the options is they can show a
 
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
test that they're not communicable when
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
they arrive and there are a number of
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
different options that are provided so
 
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
it gives freedom of choice and it gives
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
a mechanism to ensure public confidence
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
to attend any particular event so i
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
would advocate for as many options as we
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
can provide the public to give them the
 
00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
confidence to make that choice to
 
00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
purchase their tickets
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
and then to follow up earlier
 
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
on your question as far as the vaccines
 
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
go again there are lots of studies that
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
will give you lots of different
 
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
perspectives on all of these we are
 
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
in in some ways living an experiment and
 
00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
the numbers are bearing out the benefits
 
00:50:49.359 --> 00:50:50.150 align:start position:0%
the numbers are bearing out the benefits
and

00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
some of the challenges associated with
 
00:50:53.829 --> 00:50:53.839 align:start position:0%
it but
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
as my colleague stated this is a macro
 
00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
level concern for a business and not one
 
00:51:01.109 --> 00:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
that we are interested in taking a stand
 
00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
on or
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
becoming a a source of contention when
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
all we're trying to do is conduct our
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
business representative gay
 
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
did you have your hand up
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
i thought so
 
00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
i'm impressed
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question have
 
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
y'all ever attempted to put together cdc
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
guidelines and inform
 
00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:26.470 align:start position:0%
guidelines and inform
your

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
performers because some of these
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
requests are totally refuted by
 
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
cdc conclusions well i appreciate that
 
00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:36.390 align:start position:0%
cdc conclusions well i appreciate that
opportunity

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh to answer that yes in fact we do
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
share on a regular basis what current
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
cdc requirements or recommendations are
 
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
with our audiences with our employees
 
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
and with the outside contracted
 
00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
entertainment that come in the
 
00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.309 align:start position:0%
entertainment that come in the
performers

00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
performers
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
that being said it's it's a difference
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
between what individual
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
responses are in terms of whether they
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
are vaccinated and what is comfortable
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
for a group
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
to be able to make a decision to come
 
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
together and then
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
generate the appropriate amount of
 
00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
financial activity that justifies that
 
00:52:11.119 --> 00:52:12.069 align:start position:0%
financial activity that justifies that
business

00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
so you know it is not our role to
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
educate every performer
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
although in the last 22 months i've
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
worked very hard being involved behind
 
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
the scenes advocating for how best to
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
approach these safety concerns
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
associated with operating the business
 
00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:28.470 align:start position:0%
associated with operating the business
but

00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
the volume of material that's out there
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
that can be used to refute or to support
 
00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
it may it does not position us
 
00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.630 align:start position:0%
it may it does not position us
as

00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
administrators performing arts venues to
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
be the experts in the field so we do our
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
best to be responsive to uh both the
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
artists and to the audiences in front of
 
00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.069 align:start position:0%
artists and to the audiences in front of
us

00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
i hope that answers your question
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
you do realize that
 
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
there's strong opinions on both sides
 
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
and if you want to get this bill through
 
00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:02.559 align:start position:0%
it's probably
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
probably going to have to
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
undergo a compromise
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
oh i i respectfully appreciate that i
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
think compromise is is very important
 
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
that's what we do every day in our
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
business every day it's a compromise
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
about whether we're going to contract
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
with this particular performer whether
 
00:53:20.309 --> 00:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
bring an individual in who has strong
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
opinions in a personal area the
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
performing arts are a lightning rod for
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
um people who choose to
 
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.030 align:start position:0%
um people who choose to
refute

00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
refute
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
individual opinions or beliefs and so
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
anything we program in our space can be
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
interpreted as a political message when
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
in the reality is we're just trying to
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
conduct business and bring the public
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
something of that they'd like something
 
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
that they might need and something they
 
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
might not even know they want and so we
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
pri try to create a diverse program that
 
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
supports that
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative kelsey

00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
that the last few years has put
 
00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
poignancy to the phrase struggling
 
00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:15.430 align:start position:0%
poignancy to the phrase struggling
artist

00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440 align:start position:0%

right

00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%

the technology part of my reason for
 
00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
this while i'm not representing them i
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
just want to validate some things that
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
were said to make it clear that artists
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
are a huge driver in in this
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
conversation what artists require
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
i give an example dave matthews band
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
requires vaccines or testing for all of
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
their concerts
 
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
i cover saratoga performing arts center
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
and we had 23 000 people show up for a
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
concert there last summer for dave
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
matthews band all of which was able to
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
manage this this requirement of either
 
00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
vaccination or testing and the concert
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
promoter had a process in place for
 
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
validating that including doing testing
 
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
on site for uh real-time testing or the
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
instant testing they have
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
um but i will say the the venue the
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
artists do drive a lot of this and for
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire the reason is belknap four
 
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
i'm here is we have the bank of new
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire pavilion up in guildford
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
that venue up there
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
um drives
 
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
oh yeah i think last year we had 38
 
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
concerts probably close to almost a half
 
00:55:59.190 --> 00:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
a million people show up to do concerts
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
throughout that venue um give a take i
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
can't remember the exact number um
 
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
actually we had 52 concerts 30 almost a
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
half a million people um and again
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
almost i would say 80 of those concerts
 
00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
had some sort of requirement for testing
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
over for or for um
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
uh vaccine requirement either or
 
00:56:16.799 --> 00:56:17.750 align:start position:0%
uh vaccine requirement either or
um

00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
so it is it is an important aspect
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
especially for artists right the artists
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
are concerned i had an enhanced you know
 
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
when i do my job i was under before we
 
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
had any accommodations or requirements
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
or mandates one of the mandates i had is
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
i go backstage i have to be tested every
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
single day whether i'm vaccinated or not
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
every single person got tested if you
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
went backstage because if you look at
 
00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
dave matthews band
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
their average knights about a half a
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
million dollars in revenue for them
 
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
never mind what the venue itself makes
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
but the what the artist makes so me
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
going backstage sick and getting that
 
00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:49.839 align:start position:0%
artist sick
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
would have a multi-million dollar
 
00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
rolling effect as they have to
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
quarantine for 14 days if someone got
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
sick on their tour so there are some
 
00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
legitimate reasons for doing some of
 
00:57:00.079 --> 00:57:01.030 align:start position:0%
legitimate reasons for doing some of
this

00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
but i will say the one reason i really
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
came up was in this conversation about
 
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
mandates and requirements is the
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
contractual obligation with the patron
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
and so we had a situation i served on
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
the governor's reopening task force i
 
00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
actually wrote the
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
guidance for the performing arts center
 
00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
and worked with andrew and a couple of
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
other people
 
00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:20.799 align:start position:0%
to come up with a good set of draft
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
guidelines for opening in the middle of
 
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
this pandemic that would work for them
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
so they could actually start getting
 
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
some revenue coming in rather than zero
 
00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
revenue coming but the one thing we
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
found out this last summer was we had
 
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
some people put in vaccination
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
requirements after ticket sales and then
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
was refusing to
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
refund money and that's a major problem
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
that needs to be addressed if this bill
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
if you choose to move forward on this
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
bill those kind of contractual
 
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
obligations between the patron who
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
bought the ticket
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
thinking there was no vaccine
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
requirement no mask requirement and then
 
00:57:54.309 --> 00:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
later comes out they set one needs to
 
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
have some sort of remedy for um getting
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
their money back because they're not
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
going to attend
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
and that was the main reason i wanted to
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
speak was that contractual obligation
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
between the patron
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
and the and the venue itself to make
 
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
sure that if a rule like this is put in
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
place that it's clear that venues have
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
an obligation to refund money if they
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
change the terms and conditions that the
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
ticket was sold under
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you um if
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
would you see that be being
 
00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:25.270 align:start position:0%
would you see that be being
what

00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
we need to do to amend the bill or while
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
you're up do you see anything else
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
in it um in looking at the bill again i
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
i don't i'm not sure there's an
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
a necessity for this bill because
 
00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:38.799 align:start position:0%
businesses can already do everything
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
that's in this bill right are
 
00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:42.559 align:start position:0%
these the theater companies already do i
 
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:43.839 align:start position:0%
know andrew what he does i know bank of
 
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire already does um they're
 
00:58:47.349 --> 00:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
almost everything in here they're
 
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
already doing i think andrew's point to
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement is probably they want to
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
point to the big bad government says we
 
00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
got to do this because the big bad
 
00:58:55.589 --> 00:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
government said so and that's part of
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
this is there looking for a scapegoat um
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
that's just my personal opinion um and
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
you're not speaking for fish and game on
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
that i'm not speaking for fish and game
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
on that not at all sir
 
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
anyway uh so that
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
that's what i do think is going on i
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
think part of this is that they want
 
00:59:14.069 --> 00:59:14.079 align:start position:0%
somebody to point to to say we have this
 
00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
policy and here's why it's government
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
said kind of thing
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
my opinion my second question which is
 
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
unrelated i know in the 19th century the
 
00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:23.990 align:start position:0%
unrelated i know in the 19th century the
chautauqua

00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
chautauqua
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
facility in upstate new york had an
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
outdoor but very well covered pipe organ
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
any of the facilities that you manage
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
have uh the need for a classically
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
trained pipe organist
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
who would do it for far less than the
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
band you referenced i can reach out to
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
dave matthews being see if they have an
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
odd chance for you as zach brown band
 
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
both of which i'm friends with and see
 
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
if they can do something for you but i'm
 
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
thinking not the lightest shade of pale
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
demands a hammond organ
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions for the
 
00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:55.990 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions for the
representative

00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative guy
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
actually i would like some replace
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking
 
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps even if everybody
 
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
okay this is one of those statements
 
01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
with question mark at the end perhaps if
 
01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
currently all the activities that are
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
being asked to may be made formally
 
01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:26.710 align:start position:0%
being asked to may be made formally
legal

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
even if we didn't need all that
 
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
your point sounds very very reasonable
 
01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.470 align:start position:0%
your point sounds very very reasonable
that

01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
patrons do need the protection that if
 
01:00:37.599 --> 01:00:38.870 align:start position:0%
patrons do need the protection that if
the

01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
if the requirements are sprung on them
 
01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
after they bought the tickets that they
 
01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.549 align:start position:0%
after they bought the tickets that they
deserve

01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
deserve
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
getting the money back
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
and and this is really
 
01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
sort of related to
 
01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:54.799 align:start position:0%
the issue of people donating money to
 
01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
the truckers in canada and then finding
 
01:00:56.559 --> 01:00:57.589 align:start position:0%
the truckers in canada and then finding
out

01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:00:58.710 --> 01:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
they're not going to get it back and
 
01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:00.799 align:start position:0%
it's not going to the truckers so i mean
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
this finance oh you didn't know about
 
01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
that okay sorry ignore that it wasn't
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
part of this
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
so it does sound like there is a
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
requirement for a bill that would
 
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
protect people
 
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't it
 
01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
so i think i think
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i got the question mark at the end
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
okay so again
 
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
i do think that you pass a bill like
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
this there should be an additional
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
requirement on the the venues are
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
looking for some protections and the
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
additional requirements should be that
 
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
they they value the patient's contract
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
that if it's a new
 
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:34.950 align:start position:0%
that if it's a new
um

01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
requirement that sprung on the patron
 
01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
after they purchased a ticket then that
 
01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
would should void the contract purchase
 
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
of the ticket and you get your ticket
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
money back
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
i did
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
if we did put this policy and say the
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
bill does move forward
 
01:02:07.109 --> 01:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
and it's basically patrons who are
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
surprised by policy can say oh i didn't
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
i just don't see that that
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
that might be a can of worms
 
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
you know i agree it's ripe for abuse you
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
know someone who just can't make it that
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
night decides that it's the reason is
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
they after the ticket was purchased they
 
01:02:30.069 --> 01:02:30.079 align:start position:0%
put a mask mandate and they don't want
 
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
to do it so it could open a giant can of
 
01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
worms i agree
 
01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
i will say again we found out this
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
summer through one of the local venues
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire that refused to
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
give money back we had to get the
 
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office involved to
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
get them to square it away with the with
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
the venue ultimately end up opening a
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
two-week window for reimbursement
 
01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
for people to get their money back but
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
it was a it was a big heavy load so if
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to open something like this
 
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
to government then you need to open all
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
of it and clean it all up and and deal
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
with this fact of the patron
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
venue relationship when contract terms
 
01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.309 align:start position:0%
venue relationship when contract terms
change

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
representative would you agree with me
 
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
that it should not be worded oh i didn't
 
01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:05.829 align:start position:0%
that it should not be worded oh i didn't
know

01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
when it is posted on any site from which
 
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
you buy tickets
 
01:03:17.349 --> 01:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
and going forward
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise anybody could claim ignorance
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
but if you can prove the date
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
this is when we put it on you are
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
without excuse if you later choose not
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
to go for whatever reason would you
 
01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.470 align:start position:0%
to go for whatever reason would you
believe

01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
buyer beware is always good
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
policy so you know what you're buying
 
01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
know what you're getting into
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh anyone else representative weber did
 
01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
great minds that'll think alike we do
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
and with that i would like to close the
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
hearing on house bill 1639 and open an
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
exact session on the same bill 1639
 
01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of discussing only and
 
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
not voting what we just heard
 
01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:05.039 align:start position:0%
to see
 
01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
if we can come to
 
01:04:08.319 --> 01:04:11.029 align:start position:0%
if we can come to
1369

01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
1369
 
01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
what i meant
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i do there's a lot of dyslexia
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
going around
 
01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:18.870 align:start position:0%
going around
uh

01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
representative knurk
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh so
 
01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
i was the reason i got out of my chair
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
was to run back to representative lane
 
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
because he makes a very good point i've
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
already prepared an amendment which
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
would change the statutory reference
 
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
based upon the amendment which was
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
distributed from representative wilhelm
 
01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
and i was coming up with wording but i
 
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
want to know if this was acceptable be
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
not burden ols with multiple requests
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
for amendments that we don't we keep
 
01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.029 align:start position:0%
for amendments that we don't we keep
changing

01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
changing
 
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
that at the end of the current amendment
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
line 10
 
01:04:52.799 --> 01:04:54.549 align:start position:0%
line 10
says

01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
instead of a period at the end of the
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
word investments it would say provided
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
that refunds for tickets shall be
 
01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:01.839 align:start position:0%
offered if such policies are changed
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
after the ticket is purchased
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
and given the question it was just asked
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
we could probably add something like
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
and the patient has
 
01:05:09.359 --> 01:05:11.349 align:start position:0%
and the patient has
patient

01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
patient
 
01:05:11.359 --> 01:05:12.230 align:start position:0%
patient
sorry

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
other hat uh there is therapeutic value
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
to music i still keep falling back into
 
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
old habits and the patron uh same letter
 
01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
uh the patron uh
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:25.750 align:start position:0%
has been
informed

01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
informed
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
of the policies prior to
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
purchase i'm trying to figure out that
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
wordsmithing the usual thing
 
01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
you know when you make a reservation it
 
01:05:35.589 --> 01:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
says i understand the policies uh the
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
terms and agreement of
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
the airline flight or the hotel
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
reservation regarding cancellation
 
01:05:42.069 --> 01:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
policy and you check a box since most of
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
these sales are online that'd be very
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
easy for them to put in you've checked
 
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
it and it's therefore clarified that you
 
01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
are aware of the policies but if they
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
change them you get a refund
 
01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
would the committee feel that's
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate and help me with the wording
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
and i'll get this submitted
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
microphone please
 
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
my apologies thank you um
 
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
i was going to say provided that refunds
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
for tickets be provided if policies
 
01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:13.640 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
covid19 including mask requirements
 
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine and clients testing requirements
 
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
are a combination thereof using the same
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
language that is on lines six and seven
 
01:06:24.319 --> 01:06:26.069 align:start position:0%
language that is on lines six and seven
change

01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
question of that do we need to still add
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
some mechanism in which we document that
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
the person was informed at the time of
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
purchase because again they could say
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
well i wasn't aware of that but if you
 
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
have a checkoff off
 
01:06:47.109 --> 01:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
then i
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
provided that refunds for tickets be
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
provided if policies posted at the time
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
for the audience um during an exec
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
session we do not take further testimony
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
but we can ask with the permission of
 
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
the chair different ones to answer a
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
specific question so my question to mr
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
bernard is
 
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
are you comfortable with this because it
 
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
i think the contract with the patron is
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
a very important one and i
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
do not believe that most venues would
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
have any concerns
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
as long as it is specific to this topic
 
01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
the concerns of illness the concerns of
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
people who just don't feel like showing
 
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
up and then use this as an excuse
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
this has been a very real problem uh so
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
but i i know most of the venues in the
 
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
state very specifically
 
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
elaborate what their policies are ahead
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
of time with that intent representative
 
01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:58.870 align:start position:0%
of time with that intent representative
folsom

01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
folsom
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.270 align:start position:0%
mr chair and thank you for taking my
question

01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh don't go away i have a question for
 
01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:07.029 align:start position:0%
uh don't go away i have a question for
you

01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:08:07.039 --> 01:08:08.829 align:start position:0%
you
sorry

01:08:08.829 --> 01:08:08.839 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
um what percentage of the ticket sales
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
are online
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
nowadays 100 of the ticket sales are
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
available so if there was a box that
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
they had to check off saying i
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
are the requirements for this
 
01:08:24.319 --> 01:08:26.470 align:start position:0%
are the requirements for this
performance

01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
performance
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
two of the venues i'm associated with do
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
exactly that
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
they already check a box that state that
 
01:08:37.110 --> 01:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
i will wear a mask that does not
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
however reflect
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
their reaction when they arrive
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
they're often people who purchase a
 
01:08:46.149 --> 01:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
ticket and forget they check the box
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
um or some that perhaps a person
 
01:08:51.829 --> 01:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
purchased the tickets and gifted them to
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
others that is one of the particular
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
challenges that why that is why when
 
01:08:57.669 --> 01:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
we're doing ticketing we're trying very
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
hard to include the policy on the ticket
 
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
so that people have access to that
 
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.349 align:start position:0%
so that people have access to that
information

01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
would there also be a
 
01:09:05.679 --> 01:09:06.630 align:start position:0%
would there also be a
form

01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
form
 
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
available at the box office should box
 
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
offices suddenly reappear and someone
 
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
comes and buys the ticket there that
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
here's the form read it check it sign it
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
again most venues that i'm aware of in
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire currently have some sort
 
01:09:23.669 --> 01:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
of notice posted prior to the purchase
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
and there's also practice of the
 
01:09:26.789 --> 01:09:26.799 align:start position:0%
individuals who are selling the ticket
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
to remind people of the policies prior
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
to accepting payment representative
 
01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:34.229 align:start position:0%
to accepting payment representative
weber

01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
weber
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
the sentence here is getting very very
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
long so
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
if perhaps we left the period after
 
01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:42.390 align:start position:0%
if perhaps we left the period after
final

01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
final
 
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
financial investments
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
and we started a whole new sentence
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
then we could say if policies posted
 
01:09:53.829 --> 01:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
relative if policies
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
sorry that's got to go in another place
 
01:09:58.870 --> 01:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
if policies relative to covert 19 with
 
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
posted at the time of purchase change
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
after the purchase is completed the
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
venue shall refund the ticket price if
 
01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:12.709 align:start position:0%
venue shall refund the ticket price if
the

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
i said if the if the patron requests
 
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
i'm looking for nodding is that
 
01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
you have to ask me uh representative
 
01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:33.189 align:start position:0%
you have to ask me uh representative
soloway

01:10:33.189 --> 01:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
soloway
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
um i would just point out uh to this
 
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
committee that we're doing an awful lot
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
of legislating
 
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
including the term
 
01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
covid 19
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
in statute and i would simply like to
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
point out that within the foreseeable
 
01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:53.590 align:start position:0%
point out that within the foreseeable
future

01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
profit 19 is more than likely to
 
01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
disappear as our most immediate threat
 
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
and perhaps we ought to substitute
 
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
verbiage such as
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
infectious or communicable disease
 
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
rather than covid19 so that we don't
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
have to go back a few years from now and
 
01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
repeal all the statutes that we've
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
passed with regard to covid19
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
i was thinking the same thank you for
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
articulating it that would mean that
 
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
line three of the bill would need to
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
change uh but while we're up you know
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
let's do that representative weber is is
 
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
the phrase that you would like if paul
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
infectious or communicable disease
 
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
policies relating to and we change it in
 
01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
two places at that point thank you
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
let's speak to that issue anybody have a
 
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
point representative folsom
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
think out loud
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
okay i'll try and think out loud with
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
this one he heard me groan i mean think
 
01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:52.830 align:start position:0%
this one he heard me groan i mean think
out

01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
i i would have
 
01:12:04.709 --> 01:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
it would have to be
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
i would want it to be tied to
 
01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
emergency orders had been put in place
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
regarding some
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
disease because
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
the flu is
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
can be rampant and communicable
 
01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.750 align:start position:0%
can be rampant and communicable
um

01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:26.550 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
you know that and an infectious so
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know i i think that's a little bit
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
broad for me
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
um i would propose to the committee that
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
we go back to looking at line six on the
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
amendment proposed by representative
 
01:12:47.199 --> 01:12:48.950 align:start position:0%
amendment proposed by representative
wilhelm

01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
wilhelm
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
and two things one is we would strike
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
the rsa 141 and substitute that for the
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation from department health
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:02.550 align:start position:0%
 
59t

01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
59t
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay and then the other side of the coin
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
would be on line six
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
to be consistent with what
 
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative soloway is presenting
 
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
which i think is logical
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
is that at the end of the sentence where
 
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
it says in response to
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
to be a canonical disease pandemic
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
which is going back to declared by the
 
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
emergency powers the governor so it does
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
follow representative folsom's argument
 
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
about it has to be something declared by
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
the governor as a true emergency and
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
therefore it doesn't apply strictly to
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
covet but it applies to all the pandemic
 
01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
that the governor so declare
 
01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
i'm very concerned about tying it into
 
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
the emergency declaration because
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
when the governor declares an emergency
 
01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
the governor can then declare whatever
 
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
policies the governor thinks fit
 
01:13:52.390 --> 01:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
this is not about what the governor does
 
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
this is about what private businesses do
 
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
and i think that private businesses
 
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
ought to have the authorization
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
to set policies
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
that provide them with the maximum
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
amount of revenue
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
and whatever else they as a business
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
value in the world in terms of artistic
 
01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.470 align:start position:0%
value in the world in terms of artistic
satisfaction

01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
satisfaction
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
service to the public
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
and that should not be tied to a state
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
of emergency
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the business ought
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
to set out their policies and their
 
01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:31.910 align:start position:0%
to set out their policies and their
requirements

01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
very clearly
 
01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
and you decide if you want to buy your
 
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
ticket or not
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
and if you change they're going to give
 
01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
your money back
 
01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:44.310 align:start position:0%
your money back
but

01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have to do with a state of
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
emergency that just has to do with fair
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
business practices
 
01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative kelsey
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
do we not already allow private
 
01:14:59.430 --> 01:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
businesses to do what private businesses
 
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
want to do
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
i mean i guess i'm just stuck on why why
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
put this in statute when private
 
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
businesses are already allowed to
 
01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:09.510 align:start position:0%
businesses are already allowed to
implement

01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
implement
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
all of these things i've gone to
 
01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.310 align:start position:0%
all of these things i've gone to
concerts

01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
concerts
 
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
you know in the last two years and i
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
have worn a mask and i have satisfied
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
the other requirements the multi-layer
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
mitigation i that was my choice you know
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
as a patron to do that and i respected
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
the private business that they wanted me
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
to do that so i guess i'm just trying to
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
figure out why we have to put this in
 
01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
statute when we already allow private
 
01:15:35.669 --> 01:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
businesses to do what private businesses
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
want to do may i suggest that's not
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily the case and we will have
 
01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
legislation before us that we'll further
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
go in the opposite direction
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
representative uh yes one thing is i
 
01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
would actually avoid use of the word
 
01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
pandemic and other things like this the
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
point is
 
01:15:59.830 --> 01:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
it has to be nimble public health
 
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
response should be flexible and it's
 
01:16:04.149 --> 01:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
difficult to have it in statute because
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
it's hard to anticipate none of us would
 
01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
have anticipated what went on the last
 
01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
two years
 
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
a pandemic means around the world
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
you could have a localized epidemic of
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
some kind of disorder for example
 
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
measles uh something else where
 
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
a venue would want to do something
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
because they'd like to be able to stay
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
open so i don't think we should have any
 
01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.430 align:start position:0%
open so i don't think we should have any
specific

01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
comments about pandemics or diseases it
 
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
could just be flexible in terms of
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases
 
01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
and leaving it communicable uh i think
 
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
rather than infectious and communicable
 
01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
because anything
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
so i would lean toward that with the
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
other language you're talking about
 
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
thank you the reason we need the statute
 
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
is because as mr ramsey the honorable mr
 
01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:54.229 align:start position:0%
is because as mr ramsey the honorable mr
ramsey

01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
ramsey
 
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh testified
 
01:16:58.630 --> 01:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
right now if somebody shows up despite
 
01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
his policies
 
01:17:03.510 --> 01:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
but do not comport with his policies
 
01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
there's nothing he can do about it
 
01:17:08.709 --> 01:17:08.719 align:start position:0%
if we pass something like this
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
the patron shows up will not comply with
 
01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
the policies and at least the owners the
 
01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
managers of the venue can say here's
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
your 125 dollars back
 
01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
hit the road jack as opposed to
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
coming in and violating the
 
01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.910 align:start position:0%
coming in and violating the
venue's

01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
venue's
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
contract with every single other person
 
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
who's in the place
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
i think that's a really great balance
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
but that's just me
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:40.550 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
um

01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
one of the other things that i had about
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
the bill was um
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
yes i think the private businesses have
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
the right to to
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
set their policies um and then we have
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
the right to say whether we want to go
 
01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
there or not
 
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
we've already done a couple bills where
 
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
we said
 
01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
we were trying to carve out
 
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
migraines or we were trying to carve out
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
a specific disease
 
01:18:11.669 --> 01:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
and it almost seems like we're carving
 
01:18:11.679 --> 01:18:12.470 align:start position:0%
and it almost seems like we're carving
out

01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
is should we
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
you know are we going to then have a
 
01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:21.750 align:start position:0%
you know are we going to then have a
bill

01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
next session
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
carving out
 
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
some other
 
01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
kinds of venues or or things
 
01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:31.189 align:start position:0%
kinds of venues or or things
so

01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:31.199 --> 01:18:32.790 align:start position:0%
so
i

01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
i i'm not sure i'm just sharing my
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
thoughts i'm not
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
my response to that representative would
 
01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:41.189 align:start position:0%
my response to that representative would
be

01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
that taking out the word covet 19
 
01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
is similar to our not going along with
 
01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.709 align:start position:0%
is similar to our not going along with
migraines

01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
migraines
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's moving in that direction
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh weber i think had hand
 
01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:58.470 align:start position:0%
representative uh weber i think had hand
up

01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
i was just going to say that
 
01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
historically there is nothing we can do
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
that will stop people bringing in new
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
bills that do things that are odd
 
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
or that we think are inappropriate or
 
01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
that we think get us farther down a
 
01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
slippery slope and the remedy for that
 
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
is moving itl and passing it
 
01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
i i i want to explain to our guests that
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
my asking questions are not because i
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
don't think this is a good thing for you
 
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to do
 
01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
i am just trying to parse out any
 
01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.750 align:start position:0%
i am just trying to parse out any
possible

01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
ramifications of the bill it's not that
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
i'm putting up a big red flag or
 
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
something this seems to be to me
 
01:19:46.630 --> 01:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
i'll take a couple more then we've got
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
to move on but this is to help what will
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
be an amendment writing
 
01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
two summer threesome just two more
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative merchant and then king
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
um the other side of the equation too is
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
that i think there's value to this
 
01:20:04.719 --> 01:20:05.590 align:start position:0%
that i think there's value to this
because

01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
if you have an artist who wants to come
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire
 
01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
being able to go to a policy or law
 
01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
saying the theater does have the
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
authority to do this would be helpful
 
01:20:16.629 --> 01:20:16.639 align:start position:0%
for them to secure the artist because
 
01:20:18.149 --> 01:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
if we don't have an artist we don't have
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
a performance regardless of what you can
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
think about the vaccine status so we're
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
trying to make the artists feel more
 
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable there is in fact something
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
on the books to allow the
 
01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:29.270 align:start position:0%
on the books to allow the
theater

01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
theater
 
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
to have a policy like this i think would
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
be helpful for the artist to be here
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:38.639 align:start position:0%
just for the record i'm having i'm
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
struggling with a lot of different
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
things here
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
one is that we don't
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
even though we have some bills that are
 
01:20:46.629 --> 01:20:46.639 align:start position:0%
coming through
 
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.510 align:start position:0%
 
not

01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
not allow
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
people to mandate
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
um we don't and so we're i think we're
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
talking about this prematurely or at
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
least it seems that way to me
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
the other thing is as far as
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases uh you know
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of communicable diseases
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
that really don't need
 
01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
um and my heartburn really is going to
 
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
land on the vaccine itself
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's all it as time goes on it's
 
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
proving that it's not what it was
 
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
advertised to be
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
there's no returning once it's in your
 
01:21:24.719 --> 01:21:25.750 align:start position:0%
there's no returning once it's in your
body

01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
body
 
01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:27.189 align:start position:0%
body
and

01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
i just have a hard time
 
01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:29.990 align:start position:0%
i just have a hard time
uh

01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
with that i i would go to a concert or
 
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
something if i had to wear a mask
 
01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:36.390 align:start position:0%
something if i had to wear a mask
but

01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:38.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to vaccinate
 
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
which is your choice
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
all right i'd like to name a an
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
amendment committee of two or three
 
01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
people to work on everything uh somebody
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
from either side of the both sides of
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
the playground if possible
 
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
um who do we have over here
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
representative canark anybody over
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
there's somebody else
 
01:22:08.229 --> 01:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
all right representative acton
 
01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
has the benefit of not being here in the
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
room when it was all discussed so you
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%

i'm not sure when we'll be done
 
01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
it may be we have a couple of weeks off
 
01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
before crossover
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%

the medical people of which

training along the way in ethics

the speaker's office asked me as it

often does
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
to recommend

from

01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%

01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
i looked around
 
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
i've gotten to know most of the house
 
01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:32.629 align:start position:0%
i've gotten to know most of the house
members

01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
and i recommended that
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
a republican
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
who in his master of divinity training
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
to be a protestant pastor
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
studied ethics
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
i also find a democrat
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
who has a master's degree in ethics
 
01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
and recommended them both and they were
 
01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
duly appointed
 
01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:57.270 align:start position:0%
duly appointed
as

01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:01.189 align:start position:0%
as
the

01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:04.639 align:start position:0%
section of the law that defines what
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
this ethical ethics oversight committee
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
does says
 
01:27:11.350 --> 01:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
it's a two-way direction
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
the committee may speak to the
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
department either in the department's
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
anticipation of doing something saying
 
01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:19.510 align:start position:0%
anticipation of doing something saying
something

01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
or after it's done so
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
may initiate
 
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
by asking whoever is in the chair of the
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
ethical committee
 
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
would you take a look at this to see if
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's what this does it puts it in the
 
01:27:43.110 --> 01:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
what i am told is the right place
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
and over the weekend i sent everybody
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
three pages of single-spaced
 
01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
analysis i part i ask your forgiveness
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
for the brevity of it
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
it spells out the different places in
 
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
the law we see numbers rsa this and that
 
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
so in that
 
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
testimony written testimony i gave you
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
over the weekend
 
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
it spells it all out and i've printed
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
hard copy which i'll pass out to help
 
01:28:10.639 --> 01:28:11.590 align:start position:0%
hard copy which i'll pass out to help
you

01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
further if you wish so madam chair
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's basically this it's a
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
little housekeeper thing
 
01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'll take questions
 
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:28:31.189 --> 01:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
i i hope a series is okay but i'll ask
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
after each one
 
01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:34.629 align:start position:0%
after each one
um

01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
my first question is
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
because the words in front of us rather
 
01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
than all of the intent behind it
 
01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:48.639 align:start position:0%
says subject to legislative oversight
 
01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
how do we know that this is limited only
 
01:28:51.199 --> 01:28:52.629 align:start position:0%
how do we know that this is limited only
to

01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
oversight for ethical issues rather than
 
01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:57.030 align:start position:0%
oversight for ethical issues rather than
for

01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
whatever the whim of whatever
 
01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
legislature is in power at the time when
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
it comes into
 
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
when it is needed
 
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
and i would be amenable to
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
an amendment that would insert the word
 
01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
ethics so that paragraph five or six
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
shall be subject to legislative
 
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
ethical oversight or oversight in the
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
matter of ethics i'd be very amenable to
 
01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:25.910 align:start position:0%
matter of ethics i'd be very amenable to
that

01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
and a follow-up madam chair
 
01:29:35.110 --> 01:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up thank you thank you
 
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my follow-up
 
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
my follow-up is is it a matter of
 
01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:42.149 align:start position:0%
my follow-up is is it a matter of
concern

01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
that if i look on the general court
 
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
website this is a committee that was
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
established in 2008
 
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
that currently appears to have never had
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
any meetings whatsoever
 
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
and it has currently only two named
 
01:29:58.870 --> 01:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
representatives both being from the
 
01:29:58.880 --> 01:29:59.830 align:start position:0%
representatives both being from the
house

01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
for which we thank you
 
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
but is it not
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
really worrying and troublesome to
 
01:30:10.709 --> 01:30:10.719 align:start position:0%
delegate that much authority to a
 
01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
committee that has no track record and
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
apparently only two members
 
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
i would say it has the authority to
 
01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:19.590 align:start position:0%
i would say it has the authority to
speak

01:30:19.590 --> 01:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
speak
 
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
it is advisory
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
and secondly one of the
 
01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:25.590 align:start position:0%
and secondly one of the
many

01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
committees i now chair
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
hadn't met for quite a while
 
01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
until somebody said why isn't it
 
01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
and they wangled me in not as a
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
legislator but as a private citizen
 
01:30:40.629 --> 01:30:40.639 align:start position:0%
under one category so i would say okay
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to meet so start making the
 
01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
appointments i think this is an
 
01:30:46.229 --> 01:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
important matter
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
we know in history of times when
 
01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
scientists or technical people
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
said here's how you do it and the voices
 
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
of ethics were not heard
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
and so i think this is very important
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
with this i would be happy to raise the
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
human cry that this gets named
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up
 
01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
one final follow-up um
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
would you be
 
01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
open to
 
01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
further amendment i i know it says that
 
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
the ethics oversight advisory committee
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
so that sounds like the committee's
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
meant to be advisory but it says
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
an emergency order shall be subject to
 
01:31:31.510 --> 01:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight which kind of
 
01:31:33.669 --> 01:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
means to me that the legislature gets to
 
01:31:33.679 --> 01:31:34.470 align:start position:0%
means to me that the legislature gets to
say

01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh i'm not gonna do that and and i
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
think we need if what we are
 
01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
would you agree that if the intent is to
 
01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
make this an advisory opinion
 
01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
we need to make it clearer that the
 
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
opinion of this committee is merely
 
01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:53.510 align:start position:0%
opinion of this committee is merely
advisory

01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
advisory
 
01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
in which case
 
01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
some of us
 
01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:58.390 align:start position:0%
some of us
who

01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
had real concerns about the language
 
01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
when we read it the first time might
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
have far less concerns
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
knowing that this was a review
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
simply of the ethical issues involved
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
and in an advisory capacity which is not
 
01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
at all how i read it to begin with
 
01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
i would hope that as we work on this you
 
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um and thank you
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question honorable
 
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
dr cannon
 
01:32:37.110 --> 01:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative pearson representative
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
will do fine thank you
 
01:32:41.669 --> 01:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
you forgot air force major but that's
 
01:32:41.679 --> 01:32:43.030 align:start position:0%
you forgot air force major but that's
okay

01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
it occurs to me that we have
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
a department of health and human
 
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
services oversight committee
 
01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
which i believe is amply chaired thank
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
you we're dealing here with
 
01:32:59.030 --> 01:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
a suggested
 
01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.870 align:start position:0%
a suggested
ethics

01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
ethics
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
committee function
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
but also there are structural
 
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
imperatives that go along with this
 
01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
would we not be better off
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
dealing with the ethical issues under
 
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
the umbrella of the department of health
 
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
and human services oversight committee
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
i would not uh for the reason
 
01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:23.750 align:start position:0%
i would not uh for the reason
that

01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:26.550 --> 01:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh probably other than you and me i
 
01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
can't think of anyone else
 
01:33:30.629 --> 01:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
on oversight who has had training in
 
01:33:30.639 --> 01:33:31.750 align:start position:0%
on oversight who has had training in
ethics

01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
ethics
 
01:33:34.229 --> 01:33:34.239 align:start position:0%
and while not everyone to be appointed
 
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
to the ethical
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
advisory committee will have many of
 
01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
them will have
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
secondly i think that while
 
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
oversight has a very general purpose
 
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
this says that ethics is so important
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
that we want to have a special group
 
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
even if it lies dormant
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
for periods of time when it's not
 
01:33:57.030 --> 01:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily needed although it is needed
 
01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:59.910 align:start position:0%
necessarily needed although it is needed
now

01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh i i really
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
approve of such
 
01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
a few words holding so much information
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's a miracle
 
01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
but i would really appreciate
 
01:34:17.669 --> 01:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
having you expound
 
01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
the nuts and bolts of how to do this
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
whose authority how binding is the
 
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
opinion of the uh because i mean
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
it says advisory committee
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
it says shall uh it says ethics
 
01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:35.030 align:start position:0%
it says shall uh it says ethics
oversight

01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
exactly what kind of authority does the
 
01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
maybe just two members of the ethics
 
01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:43.990 align:start position:0%
maybe just two members of the ethics
committee

01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
have how much authority because it says
 
01:34:48.629 --> 01:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
shall be subject to legislative
 
01:34:48.639 --> 01:34:49.750 align:start position:0%
shall be subject to legislative
oversight

01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
i would say the authority is moral
 
01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:53.189 align:start position:0%
i would say the authority is moral
persuasion

01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
persuasion
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:55.270 align:start position:0%
in that
with

01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:56.149 align:start position:0%
with
um

01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
at least two people
 
01:34:58.560 --> 01:34:59.350 align:start position:0%
at least two people
with

01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
training and ethics and the medical
 
01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:02.950 align:start position:0%
training and ethics and the medical
people

01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
having studied ethics
 
01:35:07.109 --> 01:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
i don't think it would
 
01:35:09.990 --> 01:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
anything that this group would say
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
would not be considered lightly it would
 
01:35:17.189 --> 01:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
have in itself some authority one would
 
01:35:17.199 --> 01:35:18.070 align:start position:0%
have in itself some authority one would
hope

01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
hope
 
01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
then that the
 
01:35:22.390 --> 01:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
would recognize that as a parallel
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
very much in my own person
 
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
at the relatively early stages of the
 
01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:33.350 align:start position:0%
at the relatively early stages of the
pandemic

01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
i spoke to one of the
 
01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
section heads of dhhs on behalf of
 
01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:41.590 align:start position:0%
section heads of dhhs on behalf of
churches

01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
churches
 
01:35:44.790 --> 01:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
and being a legislator also running a
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
medical center
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
and being clergy i hit the trifecta
 
01:35:51.510 --> 01:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
so that what i said
 
01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:52.390 align:start position:0%
so that what i said
was

01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
i hope because it was well
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
considered was accepted
 
01:35:58.560 --> 01:35:59.910 align:start position:0%
considered was accepted
so

01:35:59.910 --> 01:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:03.189 --> 01:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
i think the moral suasion of this ethics
 
01:36:03.199 --> 01:36:04.470 align:start position:0%
i think the moral suasion of this ethics
advisory

01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:04.480 align:start position:0%

committee
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
would carry the day and should it not
 
01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
we always have oversight
 
01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:13.189 align:start position:0%
we always have oversight

01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%

follow-up

01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not negan negating anything you're
 
01:36:19.590 --> 01:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
saying i'm just trying to understand
 
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
exactly who do you advise the
 
01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:22.870 align:start position:0%
exactly who do you advise the
legislature

01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:23.750 align:start position:0%
legislature
the

01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
emergency order the commissioner of
 
01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:28.159 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
okay could we put that in there
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
oh it's in there somewhere already
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
oh all right rsa as it exists
 
01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
there is hereby established an ethics
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
oversight advisory committee to offer
 
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
advice to the commissioner
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
relative to the ethical issues that may
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
be identified in the course of planning
 
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
for etc etc
 
01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
and it speaks of communicable diseases
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
because covet 19 won't be the last of
 
01:36:55.199 --> 01:36:57.350 align:start position:0%
because covet 19 won't be the last of
them

01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
so it's it's in there this this
 
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
it's not in there because this is being
 
01:37:04.830 --> 01:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
added to something that's already
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
there okay
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative canark
 
01:37:12.310 --> 01:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um there are
 
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
sort of two questions that are the same
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
because the concern about limiting it to
 
01:37:19.199 --> 01:37:21.350 align:start position:0%
because the concern about limiting it to
um

01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
limiting it not being anything and
 
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
everything that they'd want to rule on
 
01:37:26.709 --> 01:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
that i would presume is already there
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
since it says pursuant to rsa 141 c 27 2
 
01:37:30.719 --> 01:37:32.149 align:start position:0%
since it says pursuant to rsa 141 c 27 2
b

01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
b
 
01:37:34.470 --> 01:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
would not you agree that since this has
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
to do with ethical issues in the course
 
01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
of responding to and planning to
 
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
outbreak communicable disease
 
01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
that it already is limited
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
and also since that is precisely what c
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
rsa 141 c 27
 
01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:49.510 align:start position:0%

reads

01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
reads
 
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
why do we need this bill at all because
 
01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's already there that we have this
 
01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
committee to give advice
 
01:37:56.239 --> 01:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
committee to give advice
so

01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:56.590 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:56.590 --> 01:37:58.149 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
how is this
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
actually changing anything
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
more obvious
 
01:38:11.119 --> 01:38:13.750 align:start position:0%
more obvious
um

01:38:13.750 --> 01:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
i wish
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
i could find my notes when i was
 
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
approached by important people telling
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
me do this
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
i agree and as we
 
01:38:30.149 --> 01:38:30.159 align:start position:0%
periodically hear in various bills such
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
as the last one
 
01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of this stuff's already there
 
01:38:36.629 --> 01:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
but sometimes it's nice to put it in a
 
01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
couple of places
 
01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:40.470 align:start position:0%
couple of places
follow-up

01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
follow-up well the last one wasn't in
 
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
law it was in practice this already
 
01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
exists in law
 
01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
because 127 741 c272b
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
already states that this is established
 
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
and this is what its job is is to offer
 
01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:55.830 align:start position:0%
and this is what its job is is to offer
advice

01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
advice
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
so unless it's altering that i'm just
 
01:39:00.149 --> 01:39:00.159 align:start position:0%
still not quite sure why we would need
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
to reinforce it
 
01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
i wish you could remember why i was
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
asked to do it because i don't
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative merchant thank you madam
 
01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:13.830 align:start position:0%
representative merchant thank you madam
chair

01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr chairman for taking the
 
01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:17.270 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr chairman for taking the
question

01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
when i look back at the rsa which is
 
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
referred to on the committee
 
01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
this talks about a legislative oversight
 
01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:27.830 align:start position:0%
this talks about a legislative oversight
committee

01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
i was under the assumption the
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee was
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
comprised of legislators
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
what this has in this bill it converts
 
01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
back to rsa 141c to
 
01:39:43.109 --> 01:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
if you look at the list of members
 
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
there's 15
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
of the 15 there's only three legislators
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
on that advisory committee that is
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
correct so therefore is this really a
 
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
legislative committee or is this really
 
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
kind of an oversight committee because i
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
think legislator
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
or legislative committee is sort of a
 
01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:02.310 align:start position:0%
or legislative committee is sort of a
misnomer

01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:03.669 --> 01:40:03.679 align:start position:0%
i'd defer to somebody who's been in the
 
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
house longer to me it's a semantic issue
 
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
i know there are some committees that
 
01:40:13.590 --> 01:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
don't have legislators appointed to them
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
but the legislature nevertheless
 
01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
established that committee and i hear
 
01:40:19.350 --> 01:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
them referred to as a legislative
 
01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
committee even though there's no legit
 
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
that's probably incorrect speaking
 
01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:25.669 align:start position:0%
that's probably incorrect speaking
this

01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
ethics advisory committee
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
as you rightly point out has two reps
 
01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
people would it be helpful madam chair
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
if if the written copy of what i emailed
 
01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
was handed out now because it has
 
01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
things that are spelled out that would
 
01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
benefit those who aren't researching
 
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
them on their computers yes i think
 
01:41:03.109 --> 01:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:03.119 --> 01:41:04.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to keep a list and uh get
 
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
people recognized as i see the hands
 
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully that's an all right situation
 
01:41:11.109 --> 01:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
can i just give a point of information
 
01:41:16.390 --> 01:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
just just a point of information just to
 
01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:19.109 align:start position:0%
just just a point of information just to
clarify

01:41:19.109 --> 01:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:21.679 align:start position:0%
actually uh what will be coming out if
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's the same as the email
 
01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh discussed
 
01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:27.679 align:start position:0%
what is stated in 141 c272b that's
 
01:41:32.149 --> 01:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
actually what's stated in 141 c 27 1. so
 
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
just so we have the proper statutory
 
01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:42.470 align:start position:0%
just so we have the proper statutory
reference

01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
and that is in the bottom of the first
 
01:41:44.159 --> 01:41:47.189 align:start position:0%
and that is in the bottom of the first
page

01:41:47.189 --> 01:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
you're saying that it has not just the
 
01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
2b but also no what it is what's what's
 
01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
quoted there in italics is actually 141
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
c 27 roman numeral 1.
 
01:41:58.709 --> 01:41:58.719 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
01:41:59.830 --> 01:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying is it's confusing it
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
says 127 c27 2b reads and then it says
 
01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:04.310 align:start position:0%
says 127 c27 2b reads and then it says
one

01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's actually
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
what you mean i think
 
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
chairman was that 127 141 c 27
 
01:42:13.590 --> 01:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
1 reads
 
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
of the first page this uh let's make
 
01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
sure that it doesn't become a discussion
 
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
but yes this um the point was raised at
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the first page the
 
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
reference is apparently to rsa 141-c
 
01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:30.470 align:start position:0%
reference is apparently to rsa 141-c
27-1

01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
27-1
 
01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
because there's the roman numeral one
 
01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
there in that language yes and that's
 
01:42:34.159 --> 01:42:34.870 align:start position:0%
there in that language yes and that's
what

01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
the chair has actually put in but he has
 
01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
above it the introduction before there's
 
01:42:41.109 --> 01:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
something called for the colon 2b it's
 
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
actually one
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
because 2b is
 
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
2b is reading review at least annually
 
01:42:47.669 --> 01:42:47.679 align:start position:0%
reported investigations blah blah blah
 
01:42:49.189 --> 01:42:49.199 align:start position:0%
that's just a minor error but i want to
 
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
make sure we all knew so we're talking
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
the same language okay and
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
may i approach the let me show them
 
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
is this 2b here or is this one up there
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
this you're quoting one
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
okay all right sorry thank you thank you
 
01:43:17.430 --> 01:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's called the ethics oversight
 
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
sorry i think i'm uh being a little too
 
01:43:28.149 --> 01:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
mis permissive here this is sounding
 
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
more like an executive session so i'll
 
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
bring it back
 
01:43:32.709 --> 01:43:32.719 align:start position:0%
i'm letting him know where his area is
 
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
so we can we can make progress i
 
01:43:35.910 --> 01:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate that there were other voices
 
01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
that were starting to come up as well so
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
i wanted to pull the reins back in there
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm going to recognize i have a
 
01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
list here of people as their names came
 
01:43:45.990 --> 01:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
up i was going to ask one question as
 
01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.109 align:start position:0%
up i was going to ask one question as
chair

01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question i've
 
01:43:52.390 --> 01:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
heard the term with great response great
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
with great power comes great
 
01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility while i recognize you
 
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
don't remember the specific people who
 
01:43:59.830 --> 01:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
asked you to do this were they perhaps
 
01:44:01.750 --> 01:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
some who realize just
 
01:44:03.990 --> 01:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
how broad the powers could be in other
 
01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
hands that might not be quite as
 
01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:07.350 align:start position:0%
hands that might not be quite as
restrained

01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
restrained
 
01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
the people who
 
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
the people who asked me to do this said
 
01:44:15.189 --> 01:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
it is very important we have people who
 
01:44:15.199 --> 01:44:16.390 align:start position:0%
it is very important we have people who
respond

01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
respond
 
01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
thinking ethically
 
01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
and that this advice is given
 
01:44:24.310 --> 01:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
not just as a bunch of people who are
 
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
chuffed off at something but people who
 
01:44:29.590 --> 01:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
have been trained to think ethically
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
about questions
 
01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:39.990 --> 01:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
do you believe that the list of people
 
01:44:42.550 --> 01:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
trained to think ethically about
 
01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:44.470 align:start position:0%

01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
are we delegating the right decision to
 
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
the right group of people
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
and my further question is
 
01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
aren't you really
 
01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:46.550 align:start position:0%
aren't you really
um

01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:49.189 --> 01:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
sorry that you started this discussion
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
by saying this is a simple housekeeping
 
01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:53.270 align:start position:0%
by saying this is a simple housekeeping
bill

01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
to the first question which is always
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
the kiss of death
 
01:45:58.470 --> 01:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
to the first question no to the second
 
01:45:58.480 --> 01:45:59.830 align:start position:0%
to the first question no to the second
question

01:45:59.830 --> 01:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:01.830 align:start position:0%
question
absolutely

01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
i do not believe
 
01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:05.030 align:start position:0%
i do not believe
necessarily

01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:46:07.669 --> 01:46:07.679 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to dare to say i do not
 
01:46:10.149 --> 01:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
believe in fact
 
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
everyone mentioned there hasn't any idea
 
01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
what ethics is
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying they're unethical people
 
01:46:17.910 --> 01:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
that's not what i'm saying exactly the
 
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
scientific or the academic study of
 
01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:22.229 align:start position:0%
scientific or the academic study of
ethics

01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
ethics
 
01:46:24.830 --> 01:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh is not probably
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
something they have ever had
 
01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:31.430 align:start position:0%
something they have ever had
and

01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:33.109 --> 01:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
you know the question of how do you do
 
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
it versus should you do it i should have
 
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
asked of myself
 
01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
because i probably should have rewritten
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
what this ethics advisory group is about
 
01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
not that these are aren't fine people
 
01:46:48.149 --> 01:46:48.159 align:start position:0%
but their opinions their stakeholder
 
01:46:48.159 --> 01:46:50.229 align:start position:0%
but their opinions their stakeholder
subgroups

01:46:50.229 --> 01:46:50.239 align:start position:0%
subgroups
 
01:46:50.239 --> 01:46:52.310 align:start position:0%
subgroups
opinions

01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
opinions
 
01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
can be heard in other venues than
 
01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gay
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm chair
 
01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:06.870 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm chair
um

01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
as i look at what's different between
 
01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679 align:start position:0%
the current law and what is proposed
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
what's missing in the current law of
 
01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
what you've just really defined thank
 
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
you so much
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
the emergency order
 
01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
and the advisory of the ethics of
 
01:47:24.550 --> 01:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
i mean if that's the ethics oversight
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
advisory committee the people that
 
01:47:28.639 --> 01:47:29.590 align:start position:0%
advisory committee the people that
madame

01:47:29.590 --> 01:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
madame
 
01:47:33.189 --> 01:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
weber representative weber just read
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
those certainly seem to be you know
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
important people for input on dealing
 
01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
with but they don't really
 
01:47:42.229 --> 01:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
satisfy the requirements of being an
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
expert at ethics
 
01:47:46.790 --> 01:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
so somehow it seemed like it would be
 
01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
nice if you could rewrite this so that
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
once again
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
you have an ethics
 
01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
this is not ethics oversight committee
 
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
i'm saying
 
01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call a committee of
 
01:48:00.870 --> 01:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
two right now and possibly more but
 
01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:03.679 align:start position:0%
people skilled in the study of ethics
 
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
somehow to be more advisory to this
 
01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:07.590 align:start position:0%
somehow to be more advisory to this
group

01:48:07.590 --> 01:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
because that list of people just isn't
 
01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:11.350 align:start position:0%
because that list of people just isn't
really

01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
an ethics advisory committee
 
01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
so i want to see the
 
01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
ethics advisory
 
01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
to supersede and advise the the people
 
01:48:24.550 --> 01:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
in that long list of people it's not my
 
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
place when i sit on this end of the room
 
01:48:28.390 --> 01:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
to ask any one of you questions but let
 
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
me make the statement
 
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
should the question be asked of me
 
01:48:37.750 --> 01:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh would i be well advised to rewrite
 
01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:38.709 align:start position:0%
uh would i be well advised to rewrite
the

01:48:38.709 --> 01:48:38.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
particip the list of participants to
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
make sure that an ethics advisory
 
01:48:44.239 --> 01:48:45.350 align:start position:0%
make sure that an ethics advisory
committee

01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:48:49.030 --> 01:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
is a committee of people trained
 
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
in ethics
 
01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
given the fact that these other
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
wonderful groups of people
 
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to have their voices
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
heard in other ways
 
01:49:03.990 --> 01:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
well this is not a housekeeping building
 
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
one follow-up
 
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
because the emergency order is what's in
 
01:49:11.109 --> 01:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
your bill and it's nowhere near what's
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
already in the law
 
01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
i didn't find that anywhere
 
01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
so i would want that combined with the
 
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
pleasure of the chair i'd be much i'd be
 
01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
very happy to stop talking which is
 
01:49:24.629 --> 01:49:24.639 align:start position:0%
again a miracle
 
01:49:24.639 --> 01:49:25.830 align:start position:0%
again a miracle
um

01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
with the understanding that i will go
 
01:49:31.910 --> 01:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
off and rewrite an amendment and be well
 
01:49:34.149 --> 01:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
advised by anyone who wishes to speak to
 
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
me and many of you have already well
 
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
spoken to me may i withdraw
 
01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:47.830 align:start position:0%
spoken to me may i withdraw
yes

01:49:47.830 --> 01:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
oh sorry and uh now the chair
 
01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
recognizes russian chester from bedford
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:02.149 --> 01:50:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chair thank you
 
01:50:04.229 --> 01:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
just a quick aside
 
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
some of those individuals that you
 
01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
identified like the disabilities write
 
01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:11.510 align:start position:0%
identified like the disabilities write
center

01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
center
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
they have quite a bit of experience with
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
regards to ethics i wasn't able to write
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
all of the folks down
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is the reason why
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
this bill exists for we the people is
 
01:50:25.189 --> 01:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
because in the most recent round of
 
01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
executive orders
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
this exists
 
01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
but it's not as there's no teeth to it
 
01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
so although we the people brought it
 
01:50:37.830 --> 01:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
forward and said this is not okay
 
01:50:40.629 --> 01:50:40.639 align:start position:0%
that this executive order is you're
 
01:50:42.629 --> 01:50:42.639 align:start position:0%
doing this you need to we need to file
 
01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
an ethics complaint or we need to have
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
the ethics committee bring it forward
 
01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
because we truly believe
 
01:50:52.950 --> 01:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
that our that the executive order
 
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
violated ethics
 
01:50:58.550 --> 01:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
bottom line and so that's why we asked
 
01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
for it and basically we were told well
 
01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
we don't have to do it so we're not
 
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
that's why this bill needs to pass
 
01:51:08.629 --> 01:51:08.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:12.149 --> 01:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
and seeing no no further speakers i will
 
01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
okay daddy back in the chair thank you
 
01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
so much and thank you for chairing that
 
01:51:27.910 --> 01:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you for ripping my bill to
 
01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
shreds so that a new one can emerge in a
 
01:51:32.070 --> 01:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
much better way
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you folks all right don't run away
 
01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:41.990 align:start position:0%
thank you folks all right don't run away
um

01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
the honorable lady and i have spoken
 
01:51:46.149 --> 01:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
over the weekend as to
 
01:51:49.109 --> 01:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
some bills that are not urgent
 
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
but uh they will be in about three or
 
01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
four weeks that we could profitably
 
01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:00.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:52:00.629 --> 01:52:00.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:52:02.709 --> 01:52:02.719 align:start position:0%
that's good that's fine
 
01:52:02.719 --> 01:52:05.510 align:start position:0%

with the agreement of
 
01:52:57.750 --> 01:52:57.760 align:start position:0%

do not commit e
 
01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:11.510 align:start position:0%
do not commit e
okay

01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:18.709 --> 01:53:18.719 align:start position:0%
i spoke with representative fenton
 
01:53:18.719 --> 01:53:19.669 align:start position:0%
i spoke with representative fenton
and

01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:19.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:21.990 --> 01:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
we discussed the fact that if this bill
 
01:53:24.070 --> 01:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
were to pass
 
01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
and work its way through the system
 
01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:29.679 align:start position:0%
and then be signed
 
01:53:31.189 --> 01:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
by the governor
 
01:53:32.470 --> 01:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
into law
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
and then the committee would take a few
 
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
months to get together and
 
01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
start thinking about what would be good
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
ideas and now we're into september next
 
01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
year or this year
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be a good idea instead
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
that this wonderful
 
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:56.390 align:start position:0%
 
he

01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
he
 
01:53:58.229 --> 01:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
grabs some people
 
01:54:00.070 --> 01:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
grabs a few reps who are interested in
 
01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:01.030 align:start position:0%
grabs a few reps who are interested in
this

01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
grabs daycare people grabs parents grabs
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
people who are involved and think this
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
is an important issue
 
01:54:11.589 --> 01:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
and come up with an ad hoc group
 
01:54:15.189 --> 01:54:15.199 align:start position:0%
we do this sometimes with the deaf um
 
01:54:16.709 --> 01:54:16.719 align:start position:0%
deaf and hard of hearing community of
 
01:54:19.189 --> 01:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
the states of the state
 
01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
and that representative fenton would
 
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
pull together this ad hoc group
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
and then come up with some specifics
 
01:54:28.629 --> 01:54:28.639 align:start position:0%
that could turn into an lsr and we would
 
01:54:30.390 --> 01:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
have a bill in fact this might get it
 
01:54:33.669 --> 01:54:33.679 align:start position:0%
done even faster and it would involve
 
01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
us not having to name
 
01:54:39.270 --> 01:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:41.589 --> 01:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
and as three members of the senate good
 
01:54:41.599 --> 01:54:43.830 align:start position:0%
and as three members of the senate good
luck

01:54:43.830 --> 01:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
luck
 
01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
not that they're hard working but
 
01:54:47.189 --> 01:54:47.199 align:start position:0%
because they are
 
01:54:47.199 --> 01:54:48.629 align:start position:0%
because they are
and

01:54:48.629 --> 01:54:48.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:51.589 --> 01:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
i know in trying to fulfill the
 
01:54:54.790 --> 01:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
speaker's office's request
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
to find a couple of people who could
 
01:54:58.550 --> 01:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
serve on this or on that
 
01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
those who
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
are able and are willing are not all of
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
the reps
 
01:55:07.270 --> 01:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
and many of the reps who you would
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
really want are already serving on three
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
or four committees and will not serve on
 
01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
another one i cannot blame them
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
and so representative fenton thought
 
01:55:16.830 --> 01:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
that this would be a good
 
01:55:20.070 --> 01:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
idea and he
 
01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
thought that emotion from us
 
01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:24.310 align:start position:0%
thought that emotion from us
to

01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:25.589 align:start position:0%
to
itl

01:55:25.589 --> 01:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
itl
 
01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
because it would not speak negatively to
 
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
any just any questions yes
 
01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative acton
 
01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
i can second that because when we did
 
01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
our our study committee in 2019 there's
 
01:55:47.119 --> 01:55:48.229 align:start position:0%
our our study committee in 2019 there's
a

01:55:48.229 --> 01:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
very committed and vocal group of of
 
01:55:50.639 --> 01:55:52.310 align:start position:0%
very committed and vocal group of of
take

01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719 align:start position:0%
child daycare owners who are just
 
01:55:56.229 --> 01:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
waiting to be heard
 
01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
and so i can give him a list of people
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
to call and he can pull together an ad
 
01:56:01.990 --> 01:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
hoc committee in about an hour of phone
 
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
calls he can have it all nailed and
 
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
these people will come they'll meet they
 
01:56:07.510 --> 01:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
can do zooms
 
01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
and he can have a very productive time i
 
01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:15.189 --> 01:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative snow
 
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
that has been working for some time it's
 
01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
called the children's caucus
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
and i don't know that they focused on
 
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
this issue in particular but they might
 
01:56:28.390 --> 01:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
also have
 
01:56:29.830 --> 01:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
given some thought
 
01:56:32.229 --> 01:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
to how you accomplish this same goal
 
01:56:34.149 --> 01:56:34.159 align:start position:0%
and i know that uh
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative uh cornell
 
01:56:38.629 --> 01:56:38.639 align:start position:0%
was the chair and she's recently stepped
 
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
down and i'm trying to remember who took
 
01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:43.430 align:start position:0%
down and i'm trying to remember who took
over

01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:56:47.189 --> 01:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:47.199 --> 01:56:48.950 align:start position:0%
 
levesque

01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
levesque
 
01:56:50.709 --> 01:56:50.719 align:start position:0%
okay yes that's correct
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
so maybe at least we ought to
 
01:56:54.310 --> 01:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
give her a chat to see if there's a role
 
01:56:56.790 --> 01:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
that that caucus could play and maybe
 
01:56:58.070 --> 01:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
they've already gathered some of that
 
01:56:59.430 --> 01:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
same information
 
01:57:01.030 --> 01:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
i'll certainly pass all of these good
 
01:57:05.270 --> 01:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
ideas along to representative fenton
 
01:57:30.070 --> 01:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
when he and i discussed this uh this was
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh something he articulated i didn't
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
suggest it to him he knew it already so
 
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%

02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
and did did you in fact discuss this
 
02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:58.629 --> 02:01:58.639 align:start position:0%
should have no
 
02:01:58.639 --> 02:02:00.470 align:start position:0%
should have no
anyway

02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:12.629 align:start position:0%
anyway
no

02:02:12.629 --> 02:02:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:12.639 --> 02:02:15.350 align:start position:0%
 
18th

02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
we have two amendments on it one is by
 
02:02:21.189 --> 02:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
representative wrong which is amendment
 
02:02:21.199 --> 02:02:27.109 align:start position:0%
representative wrong which is amendment
2022-0133-h

02:02:27.109 --> 02:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:28.950 --> 02:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
we also have an amendment from
 
02:02:31.589 --> 02:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
representative veglier
 
02:02:31.599 --> 02:02:33.030 align:start position:0%
representative veglier
representative

02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:02:36.790 --> 02:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
amendment is 2022-0014h
 
02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
and for the life of me i cannot see how
 
02:02:40.629 --> 02:02:40.639 align:start position:0%
the amendment is different from what the
 
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
bill is and i've read it three times so
 
02:02:44.629 --> 02:02:44.639 align:start position:0%
if any of you can see that i'd
 
02:02:46.470 --> 02:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
02:02:48.709 --> 02:02:48.719 align:start position:0%
there's just a comma
 
02:02:51.910 --> 02:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh on line 16 following cylinder there's
 
02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
a comma
 
02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:54.229 align:start position:0%
a comma
oh

02:02:54.229 --> 02:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:02:56.310 --> 02:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
and that separates so it's not cylinder
 
02:03:02.310 --> 02:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's why we're a committee
 
02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:07.910 align:start position:0%
that's why we're a committee
okay

02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
it's the hand surgeon sticking out
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
so representative kanark if you would
 
02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
keep those in your person and not pass
 
02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
them out lest we get confused
 
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:43.510 --> 02:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
it is on the bill page 1 line 14
 
02:03:47.189 --> 02:03:47.199 align:start position:0%
the first word is cylinder
 
02:03:50.870 --> 02:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:55.430 --> 02:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:57.109 --> 02:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody's got a chance to
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
take a look at this the wrong amount it
 
02:04:02.069 --> 02:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
actually happens twice
 
02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
mr chair may i
 
02:04:07.189 --> 02:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
i who's mr cheering me me you i did not
 
02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
realize this was supposed to be done i
 
02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
had worked with the ophthalmologists i
 
02:04:13.350 --> 02:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
sent them an email last week saying
 
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
that i had to concentrate on the early
 
02:04:18.069 --> 02:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
bills and i would get back to them
 
02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679 align:start position:0%
this week to go over their concerns
 
02:04:20.950 --> 02:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
because they've emailed me with some
 
02:04:22.870 --> 02:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
concerns about the language including in
 
02:04:24.149 --> 02:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:04:26.310 --> 02:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
is there any way we could recess the
 
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
executive session on this particular
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
bill and go back to it yeah i brought
 
02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
this forward because i have a note that
 
02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:32.950 align:start position:0%
this forward because i have a note that
said

02:04:32.950 --> 02:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:04:35.350 --> 02:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
it was the hope that the democratic
 
02:04:38.069 --> 02:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
caucus would look at this this morning
 
02:04:38.079 --> 02:04:38.790 align:start position:0%
caucus would look at this this morning
but

02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
your nods are telling me you didn't
 
02:04:42.310 --> 02:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
which is perfectly fine
 
02:04:45.189 --> 02:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
so yeah um without objection i would
 
02:04:48.069 --> 02:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
like to recess this then so that we can
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
come back with that additional
 
02:04:52.629 --> 02:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
information representative weber i'm i'm
 
02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
very sorry i i think i was misunderstood
 
02:05:00.149 --> 02:05:00.159 align:start position:0%
or i was not at all clear which is
 
02:05:01.910 --> 02:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
perfectly possible given to my day
 
02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:04.069 align:start position:0%
perfectly possible given to my day
yesterday

02:05:04.069 --> 02:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
we did in fact have a caucus last night
 
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
but we discussed the early bills that
 
02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:10.470 align:start position:0%
but we discussed the early bills that
were

02:05:10.470 --> 02:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:05:13.270 --> 02:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
set for hearing tomorrow and we did have
 
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
some conversation about bills that
 
02:05:18.629 --> 02:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
might be ready to go this was not one of
 
02:05:22.390 --> 02:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
them representative weber since you were
 
02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
only one half of that conversation with
 
02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:26.149 align:start position:0%
only one half of that conversation with
me

02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:05:28.390 --> 02:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh it is quite possible that you uh were
 
02:05:30.390 --> 02:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
misunderstood by this half of that
 
02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:31.830 align:start position:0%
misunderstood by this half of that
conversation

02:05:31.830 --> 02:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:34.400 align:start position:0%

02:05:39.030 --> 02:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
very brief exec session having uh dealt
 
02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
with the problem of the comma

ugh

02:07:26.229 --> 02:07:26.239 align:start position:0%

i open a
 
02:07:55.750 --> 02:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
what's this an exec session executive

02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
certain health care workers chair
 
02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative kenner to
 
02:08:08.790 --> 02:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
speak to your amendment which we just
 
02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:15.750 --> 02:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair um
 
02:08:18.790 --> 02:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
yes basically there was some concern in
 
02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:19.910 align:start position:0%
yes basically there was some concern in
this

02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:08:21.589 --> 02:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
when i asked a question during the
 
02:08:21.599 --> 02:08:22.470 align:start position:0%
when i asked a question during the
hearing

02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:08:24.069 --> 02:08:24.079 align:start position:0%
if you go back to the bill for just a
 
02:08:24.079 --> 02:08:25.189 align:start position:0%
if you go back to the bill for just a
moment

02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
moment
 
02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
on page 1 line 13 it says that
 
02:08:31.990 --> 02:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
the individual shall
 
02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
submit a public criminal history record
 
02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:36.709 align:start position:0%
submit a public criminal history record
period

02:08:36.709 --> 02:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
which means i would give you my criminal
 
02:08:39.589 --> 02:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
history record what i'm going to be
 
02:08:40.950 --> 02:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
applying and i thought that was odd and
 
02:08:42.870 --> 02:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
i asked the question about how do we
 
02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
confirm authenticity of that that
 
02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
actually evolved into a discussion of
 
02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
who does the credentialing which we
 
02:08:51.589 --> 02:08:51.599 align:start position:0%
learned was done by outside agencies
 
02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's other than just the state police
 
02:08:55.589 --> 02:08:55.599 align:start position:0%
because the current statute has it only
 
02:08:57.750 --> 02:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
going to state police
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
so what we end up doing is number one
 
02:09:02.390 --> 02:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
if you look at the wording on the
 
02:09:05.189 --> 02:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
amendment on line
 
02:09:05.199 --> 02:09:06.790 align:start position:0%
amendment on line
five

02:09:06.790 --> 02:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
five
 
02:09:09.910 --> 02:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
it it goes back in not that the
 
02:09:11.589 --> 02:09:11.599 align:start position:0%
person shall give their record which
 
02:09:13.109 --> 02:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
would mean their criminal background
 
02:09:17.990 --> 02:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:19.669 --> 02:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
which authorizes the release of their
 
02:09:21.109 --> 02:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
public criminal history record to the
 
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
facility so they're now again giving
 
02:09:25.589 --> 02:09:25.599 align:start position:0%
authorization not providing the actual
 
02:09:28.310 --> 02:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
record that's point number one the
 
02:09:30.790 --> 02:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
reason that the word form was still
 
02:09:33.350 --> 02:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
deleted which is on line five
 
02:09:35.189 --> 02:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
is because that form is referring to the
 
02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
state police form and there are a number
 
02:09:37.910 --> 02:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
of different forms this gives the
 
02:09:39.510 --> 02:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
facility the choice to use their own
 
02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:40.790 align:start position:0%
facility the choice to use their own
form

02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
form
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
the second concern was in the original
 
02:09:46.629 --> 02:09:46.639 align:start position:0%
bill on line 29 on page one when it said
 
02:09:49.589 --> 02:09:49.599 align:start position:0%
the direct supervision yeah and in a
 
02:09:51.589 --> 02:09:51.599 align:start position:0%
organizational flowchart you may be a
 
02:09:53.910 --> 02:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
direct report to a direct to your
 
02:09:56.229 --> 02:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
supervisor but you may never ever see
 
02:09:58.950 --> 02:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
them uh and this was something we wanted
 
02:10:01.109 --> 02:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
a little bit closer supervision we had
 
02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
debated the word visual but that would
 
02:10:04.550 --> 02:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
really be untenable
 
02:10:07.189 --> 02:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
nurses often work alone if you ask the
 
02:10:09.030 --> 02:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
lna to go run around and take the vital
 
02:10:10.950 --> 02:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
signs of all the people somebody has to
 
02:10:12.629 --> 02:10:12.639 align:start position:0%
tag along with them directly into every
 
02:10:14.629 --> 02:10:14.639 align:start position:0%
room and that would be that would just
 
02:10:16.709 --> 02:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
not be workable so we changed it to
 
02:10:19.350 --> 02:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
direct on site supervision so that that
 
02:10:22.229 --> 02:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
person knows that at all times somebody
 
02:10:23.750 --> 02:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
could pop in and see what they're
 
02:10:25.990 --> 02:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
currently doing and we also have to
 
02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:27.109 align:start position:0%
currently doing and we also have to
remember

02:10:27.109 --> 02:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
remember
 
02:10:30.229 --> 02:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
that this is a person who will have also
 
02:10:32.149 --> 02:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
just within the prior 12 months already
 
02:10:34.390 --> 02:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
passed a criminal history a background
 
02:10:36.149 --> 02:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
history check so it's not a totally
 
02:10:38.550 --> 02:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
unknown individual 12 months ago they
 
02:10:40.709 --> 02:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
were already vetted and passed they are
 
02:10:42.550 --> 02:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
now working conditionally with a
 
02:10:44.709 --> 02:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
conditional license for 90 days while
 
02:10:46.950 --> 02:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
waiting for their new
 
02:10:49.109 --> 02:10:49.119 align:start position:0%
criminal history uh background check to
 
02:10:51.270 --> 02:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
go through and it just means that this
 
02:10:52.550 --> 02:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
has to be somebody on site that
 
02:10:55.030 --> 02:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
supervises them not visually but not
 
02:10:56.470 --> 02:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
just a direct report
 
02:11:00.390 --> 02:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:02.310 --> 02:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
any questions of the representative on
 
02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:05.030 align:start position:0%
any questions of the representative on
this

02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
or any statements this is an exact
 
02:11:08.830 --> 02:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
session you can make a
 
02:11:12.310 --> 02:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
statement yeah i was i was one of those
 
02:11:14.709 --> 02:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
who was quite concerned about
 
02:11:16.470 --> 02:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
direct supervision
 
02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
not just being a name on a flow chart so
 
02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for this
 
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
representative um snow
 
02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:25.669 align:start position:0%
representative um snow
about

02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:11:27.510 --> 02:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
this applies to anybody that has any
 
02:11:30.550 --> 02:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
direct contact with a client
 
02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
and what about contracted employees
 
02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
where i live
 
02:11:36.310 --> 02:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
we have somebody from catholic medical
 
02:11:39.109 --> 02:11:39.119 align:start position:0%
center comes in once a week draw blood
 
02:11:41.830 --> 02:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's never the same person
 
02:11:43.750 --> 02:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
does that mean each person that may be
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
asked to come
 
02:11:47.669 --> 02:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
we also have servers in the dining room
 
02:11:49.589 --> 02:11:49.599 align:start position:0%
who have a lot of direct contact
 
02:11:51.589 --> 02:11:51.599 align:start position:0%
with patients they tend to change
 
02:11:53.589 --> 02:11:53.599 align:start position:0%
frequently but the kind of conversation
 
02:11:54.629 --> 02:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
they have
 
02:11:56.629 --> 02:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
is not anything that would ever involve
 
02:11:57.830 --> 02:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
any real
 
02:11:59.750 --> 02:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
clinical or legal
 
02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
problems that i could think of so how
 
02:12:03.910 --> 02:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
far do you want to go with this
 
02:12:05.430 --> 02:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
it seems to me
 
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
you could suddenly be gathering criminal
 
02:12:09.669 --> 02:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
investigations on a whole lot of people
 
02:12:09.679 --> 02:12:11.669 align:start position:0%
investigations on a whole lot of people
people

02:12:11.669 --> 02:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:12:14.470 --> 02:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
we have landscapers who come in and you
 
02:12:16.470 --> 02:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
know they're kind of a rough human group
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
but a lot of the clients where
 
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
other residents where i live
 
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
will go out and ask them questions about
 
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
what what they're planting and how
 
02:12:26.790 --> 02:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
they're doing it
 
02:12:28.390 --> 02:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
what's the best kind of fertilizer to
 
02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
use for this kind of plant
 
02:12:32.950 --> 02:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
do they have to have that
 
02:12:35.350 --> 02:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
submit to that or they have to say
 
02:12:36.870 --> 02:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
no i'm not going to
 
02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
talk to you because i haven't
 
02:12:40.390 --> 02:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
done it i mean i think it's very
 
02:12:42.629 --> 02:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
confusing i think in language i think we
 
02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
need to refine the language
 
02:12:47.669 --> 02:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
any direct contact
 
02:12:51.109 --> 02:12:51.119 align:start position:0%
and try to refine it a little bit more
 
02:12:53.830 --> 02:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
how would you understand then lines 11
 
02:12:55.589 --> 02:12:55.599 align:start position:0%
and following of the bill
 
02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
for the durations of licensure or
 
02:12:57.679 --> 02:12:59.189 align:start position:0%
for the durations of licensure or
certification

02:12:59.189 --> 02:12:59.199 align:start position:0%

then we go into the criminal record

thing so it already seems to be a

thing so it already seems to be a

02:13:36.629 --> 02:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
it seems to define
 
02:13:38.229 --> 02:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
the scope
 
02:13:41.430 --> 02:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
and i too just wanted to emphasize that
 
02:13:47.589 --> 02:13:47.599 align:start position:0%
those words are already in statute
 
02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're modifying we're
 
02:13:51.750 --> 02:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
only modifying what
 
02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
the application process rather than who
 
02:13:57.750 --> 02:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
it covers it's all they're all already
 
02:13:59.189 --> 02:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
covered we're trying to make it easier
 
02:14:03.910 --> 02:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:05.589 --> 02:14:05.599 align:start position:0%
yeah i know i know i don't need to be
 
02:14:07.510 --> 02:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
reminded i do not need to be reminded
 
02:14:10.310 --> 02:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gay
 
02:14:12.390 --> 02:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:14:15.030 --> 02:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
we need to remind everybody that this
 
02:14:18.310 --> 02:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
bill is just to help uh nursing homes
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
and similar com similar uh facilities
 
02:14:24.629 --> 02:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
that are desperate to get employees and
 
02:14:27.510 --> 02:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
because it takes a while to get a
 
02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
criminal background check
 
02:14:32.629 --> 02:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
this just says that they can
 
02:14:34.629 --> 02:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
they don't have to have the
 
02:14:37.030 --> 02:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
they can they can employ people right
 
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
away as long as they have the
 
02:14:41.350 --> 02:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
authorization to request the criminal
 
02:14:43.109 --> 02:14:43.119 align:start position:0%
background check
 
02:14:45.990 --> 02:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
and like like representative weber
 
02:14:48.069 --> 02:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
saying we're not changing any of the
 
02:14:48.079 --> 02:14:49.669 align:start position:0%
saying we're not changing any of the
requirements

02:14:49.669 --> 02:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:14:52.069 --> 02:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
any of the people it's i think the bill
 
02:14:55.189 --> 02:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
really says you know that the license
 
02:14:57.430 --> 02:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
you're talking about people who have who
 
02:14:59.270 --> 02:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
just the people who have to be licensed
 
02:15:00.709 --> 02:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that means the person
 
02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
who's cutting the grass
 
02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:03.830 align:start position:0%
who's cutting the grass
uh

02:15:03.830 --> 02:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:15:05.830 --> 02:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
oh you think it's more more extensive
 
02:15:07.350 --> 02:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
point of information can i clarify this
 
02:15:08.870 --> 02:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
because i
 
02:15:11.030 --> 02:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
02:15:13.430 --> 02:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
no the original statute applies to
 
02:15:16.390 --> 02:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
anybody who comes in contact
 
02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:22.709 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:15:22.709 --> 02:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:15:22.719 --> 02:15:23.830 align:start position:0%
yes
representative

02:15:23.830 --> 02:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:15:26.550 --> 02:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
yes the issue is this when we're talking
 
02:15:28.149 --> 02:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
this is what was really confusing and
 
02:15:30.069 --> 02:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
came up and i spoke with uh paula
 
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
manahan about this just last night
 
02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
this is discussing institutional
 
02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:35.589 align:start position:0%
this is discussing institutional
licensure

02:15:35.589 --> 02:15:35.599 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
02:15:37.990 --> 02:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
this is not licensure of the individual
 
02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:39.030 align:start position:0%
this is not licensure of the individual
person

02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:15:42.069 --> 02:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
it's that the applicant for a license to
 
02:15:44.310 --> 02:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
to operate a facility
 
02:15:47.189 --> 02:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
has to have in place a screening for
 
02:15:49.109 --> 02:15:49.119 align:start position:0%
employment that involves a background
 
02:15:51.589 --> 02:15:51.599 align:start position:0%
check that's what this is about so we
 
02:15:53.430 --> 02:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
were talking about licensing of
 
02:15:55.350 --> 02:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
facilities that's what's being done and
 
02:15:57.350 --> 02:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
again as you've stated it's just to
 
02:15:59.189 --> 02:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
streamline the process so they don't
 
02:16:00.470 --> 02:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
have to go through the state police they
 
02:16:02.149 --> 02:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
can go through other means that's all
 
02:16:03.510 --> 02:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative snow has that been
 
02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:04.870 align:start position:0%
representative snow has that been
helpful

02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
02:16:15.350 --> 02:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:17.910 --> 02:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative canark no
 
02:16:20.550 --> 02:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
section one does section two is for
 
02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
duration of licensure or certification
 
02:16:24.310 --> 02:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
that means of the facility every
 
02:16:26.390 --> 02:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
individual selected for employment with
 
02:16:28.790 --> 02:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
the facility any facility or entity
 
02:16:30.310 --> 02:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
required to be licensed that means again
 
02:16:32.950 --> 02:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
the licensed entity uh shall have a
 
02:16:34.230 --> 02:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
criminal background check so it's not
 
02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
just the operators it means anybody who
 
02:16:38.070 --> 02:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
works there any individual selected for
 
02:16:40.950 --> 02:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
employment it's all employees but this
 
02:16:43.110 --> 02:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
is and there's a phrase i'm not going to
 
02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
use because the poor guy who did the
 
02:16:46.870 --> 02:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
last bill
 
02:16:49.589 --> 02:16:49.599 align:start position:0%
regrets it very much that he used it but
 
02:16:52.309 --> 02:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
were we not in that position of regret
 
02:16:54.549 --> 02:16:54.559 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what this bill is
 
02:16:57.830 --> 02:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
i mean it does not redefine categories
 
02:16:59.589 --> 02:16:59.599 align:start position:0%
of persons or anything like that
 
02:17:00.950 --> 02:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
actually it's it's more than just a
 
02:17:02.870 --> 02:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill what it's allowing is
 
02:17:05.030 --> 02:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's allowing them to use it's allowing
 
02:17:07.030 --> 02:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
them to to not have to use the state
 
02:17:09.429 --> 02:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
police it's to streamline the process so
 
02:17:11.429 --> 02:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
it does fundamentally change
 
02:17:13.270 --> 02:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
the process but we're not changing who
 
02:17:14.950 --> 02:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
and everything else is represented
 
02:17:16.309 --> 02:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
wherever pointed out that's all in
 
02:17:17.990 --> 02:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
statute already we're only changing
 
02:17:20.389 --> 02:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
what's struck through or what's bold
 
02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
you okay with that representative
 
02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:26.469 align:start position:0%
you okay with that representative
snowden's

02:17:26.469 --> 02:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:28.150 --> 02:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
push push the button the button makes it
 
02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:29.190 align:start position:0%
push push the button the button makes it
go

02:17:29.190 --> 02:17:29.200 align:start position:0%

yeah well you're good you're good leave
 
02:17:34.629 --> 02:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
it alone don't don't
 
02:17:36.709 --> 02:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
normally touch the only one in this room
 
02:17:38.230 --> 02:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
that has trouble with these microphones
 
02:17:40.950 --> 02:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
because we all have of our own troubles
 
02:17:42.629 --> 02:17:42.639 align:start position:0%
yes we do well i'm glad mine is
 
02:17:47.270 --> 02:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:48.309 --> 02:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
does this
 
02:17:50.870 --> 02:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
how do people feel this also covers a
 
02:17:52.870 --> 02:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
lot of these contracted licensed
 
02:17:55.190 --> 02:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
employees lab assistants
 
02:17:55.200 --> 02:17:56.389 align:start position:0%
employees lab assistants
uh

02:17:56.389 --> 02:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:17:58.950 --> 02:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
both elliott and cmc send
 
02:18:01.110 --> 02:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
different lab assistants in each time
 
02:18:02.070 --> 02:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
they come
 
02:18:04.629 --> 02:18:04.639 align:start position:0%
dna sends people in to perform certain
 
02:18:07.270 --> 02:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
duties within the facility
 
02:18:08.870 --> 02:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
do they have to get a criminal
 
02:18:10.629 --> 02:18:10.639 align:start position:0%
background check on everyone that the
 
02:18:12.549 --> 02:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
hospital is going to send or not
 
02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
the point is off the point
 
02:18:15.270 --> 02:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:18:17.750 --> 02:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's not the point of what we want
 
02:18:21.589 --> 02:18:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:21.599 --> 02:18:29.589 align:start position:0%
 
what

02:18:29.589 --> 02:18:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:18:36.469 --> 02:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:39.589 --> 02:18:39.599 align:start position:0%
representative folsom to clarify
 
02:18:41.270 --> 02:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
02:18:44.790 --> 02:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
when they hire a contractor to fill
 
02:18:46.309 --> 02:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
those positions
 
02:18:48.549 --> 02:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
it's usually that company you're
 
02:18:50.070 --> 02:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
contracting with that has done the
 
02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:58.790 --> 02:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:19:00.870 --> 02:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
and a question came up during the
 
02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:03.110 align:start position:0%
and a question came up during the
testimony

02:19:03.110 --> 02:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:19:04.870 --> 02:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
when we talk about going through the
 
02:19:06.549 --> 02:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
division of state police
 
02:19:08.629 --> 02:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
they do it
 
02:19:10.549 --> 02:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
comparison pick with the federal level
 
02:19:12.150 --> 02:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes with the fingerprinting and so
 
02:19:13.270 --> 02:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
forth to be sure that what's coming
 
02:19:15.509 --> 02:19:15.519 align:start position:0%
across the federal is matching up with
 
02:19:17.509 --> 02:19:17.519 align:start position:0%
what's on the state level
 
02:19:19.190 --> 02:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
my concern here the way this is written
 
02:19:20.629 --> 02:19:20.639 align:start position:0%
i don't oppose the way it's written per
 
02:19:20.639 --> 02:19:21.429 align:start position:0%
i don't oppose the way it's written per
se

02:19:21.429 --> 02:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
se
 
02:19:25.429 --> 02:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:27.030 --> 02:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
where you can go to get a public
 
02:19:28.790 --> 02:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
criminal back i don't know if about this
 
02:19:30.790 --> 02:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
and saying could anyone give a public
 
02:19:33.190 --> 02:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
criminal history background or because
 
02:19:34.389 --> 02:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
at least with state police you know
 
02:19:36.629 --> 02:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
you're going to a state agency
 
02:19:38.549 --> 02:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
that's acting as a clearinghouse to
 
02:19:40.469 --> 02:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
ensure that the public is getting a
 
02:19:42.070 --> 02:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
criminal background check
 
02:19:42.950 --> 02:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
when we
 
02:19:44.629 --> 02:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
delete the state police because of the
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
backlog we hear about
 
02:19:48.070 --> 02:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
my concern is that we don't have
 
02:19:49.830 --> 02:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
something as a clearinghouse at a
 
02:19:51.990 --> 02:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
federal estate agency to be acting in
 
02:19:54.309 --> 02:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
that capacity
 
02:19:56.790 --> 02:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
representative canark i'll try to answer
 
02:19:58.469 --> 02:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
them i'm frantically looking for some
 
02:20:00.630 --> 02:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
notes for my discussion with uh paula
 
02:20:02.469 --> 02:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
manahan last night i'm not able to find
 
02:20:04.950 --> 02:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
them right now but uh basically for
 
02:20:06.870 --> 02:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
example if you are going to be a
 
02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
licensed provider you still go through
 
02:20:10.230 --> 02:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
that check as a separate thing that is
 
02:20:12.230 --> 02:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
your own check that you're going through
 
02:20:14.230 --> 02:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
um like when you apply for a medical
 
02:20:15.670 --> 02:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
license and so on
 
02:20:17.349 --> 02:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
02:20:17.359 --> 02:20:18.150 align:start position:0%
this uh
the

02:20:18.150 --> 02:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:20:19.590 --> 02:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand that the
 
02:20:19.600 --> 02:20:20.710 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand that the
apparently

02:20:20.710 --> 02:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:21.670 align:start position:0%
apparently
lieutenant

02:20:21.670 --> 02:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
lieutenant
 
02:20:21.680 --> 02:20:22.870 align:start position:0%
lieutenant
sorry

02:20:22.870 --> 02:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:20:24.550 --> 02:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
from state police musli
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh was actually new to that position and
 
02:20:29.030 --> 02:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
he was confusing uh those couple of
 
02:20:30.550 --> 02:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
different things this is an employment
 
02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:31.349 align:start position:0%
different things this is an employment
check

02:20:31.349 --> 02:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
check
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
what actually would happen is
 
02:20:33.359 --> 02:20:34.710 align:start position:0%
what actually would happen is
the

02:20:34.710 --> 02:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:20:36.070 --> 02:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
remember this has to do with licensure
 
02:20:39.190 --> 02:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
so the licensing for the facility could
 
02:20:40.710 --> 02:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
set those standards of who they would
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
accept for
 
02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh doing the background check that would
 
02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
be something they would do in rules
 
02:20:47.270 --> 02:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
remember we don't have to write every
 
02:20:50.309 --> 02:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
little detail in legislation rules will
 
02:20:51.750 --> 02:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
then implement it and part of that
 
02:20:53.910 --> 02:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
implementation would be they'd say here
 
02:20:55.190 --> 02:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
are the uh
 
02:20:57.830 --> 02:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
the authorized background check
 
02:21:00.710 --> 02:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
people that you facility can use to do
 
02:21:02.230 --> 02:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
your background checks but we do not
 
02:21:04.230 --> 02:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
need to clarify that here that was
 
02:21:05.750 --> 02:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
clarified that we do need to make sure
 
02:21:07.750 --> 02:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's adequate that would be their job
 
02:21:09.190 --> 02:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
and they have agreed to do that
 
02:21:11.590 --> 02:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
02:21:13.349 --> 02:21:13.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:21:15.270 --> 02:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
um and the actual bill
 
02:21:18.790 --> 02:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
line 25 starting line 25
 
02:21:21.030 --> 02:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
agrees profoundly
 
02:21:23.190 --> 02:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
with the purpose of the bill which is it
 
02:21:25.270 --> 02:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
establishes the provisions for temporary
 
02:21:25.280 --> 02:21:26.389 align:start position:0%
establishes the provisions for temporary
employment

02:21:26.389 --> 02:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
employment
 
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
not meaning forever temporary in a
 
02:21:31.590 --> 02:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
residential care facility
 
02:21:33.510 --> 02:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
or as a licensed nursing
 
02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:34.790 align:start position:0%
or as a licensed nursing
assistant

02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
02:21:37.990 --> 02:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
by people waiting for the result of a
 
02:21:39.910 --> 02:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
criminal history background check the
 
02:21:42.870 --> 02:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
problem was you need to hire people very
 
02:21:46.070 --> 02:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
quickly now because the need is so great
 
02:21:48.790 --> 02:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
so i think excuse me
 
02:21:50.230 --> 02:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sure all the issues that we're
 
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
discussing and the terms are important
 
02:21:55.590 --> 02:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
but the purpose of this bill is to mean
 
02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
they can employ people while they are
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
waiting for whatever background check
 
02:22:01.830 --> 02:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
they have employed so all the person has
 
02:22:05.590 --> 02:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
to do the old form the old rsa says they
 
02:22:07.750 --> 02:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
have to give their their criminal
 
02:22:09.910 --> 02:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
background check they have to prove it
 
02:22:12.230 --> 02:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
and this says they can just give
 
02:22:14.550 --> 02:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
authorization for it they can start
 
02:22:17.590 --> 02:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
working and then online
 
02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
starting with 25 it gives the employer
 
02:22:23.429 --> 02:22:23.439 align:start position:0%
uh up to 90 days
 
02:22:25.349 --> 02:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
hoping that rape that criminal
 
02:22:27.670 --> 02:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
background check comes but it allows
 
02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
them to employ people before they get
 
02:22:32.550 --> 02:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
the background check
 
02:22:34.950 --> 02:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
and that's why there's all this careful
 
02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
addition in the amendment on line 17
 
02:22:40.389 --> 02:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
of how they're being watched to make
 
02:22:42.309 --> 02:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
sure that they are
 
02:22:45.030 --> 02:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
it's safe to have them there
 
02:22:47.110 --> 02:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
so as we've been discussing it seemed
 
02:22:48.550 --> 02:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
like we were getting away from the
 
02:22:50.469 --> 02:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill
 
02:22:52.870 --> 02:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
02:22:54.469 --> 02:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:22:58.230 --> 02:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
and also in regards to the
 
02:23:00.150 --> 02:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
entity that can provide the criminal
 
02:23:02.550 --> 02:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
background check i do support the fact
 
02:23:04.389 --> 02:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
that it's probably best in rules but i
 
02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
would like to have something it would
 
02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:07.990 align:start position:0%
would like to have something it would
say

02:23:07.990 --> 02:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
organization as approved by the
 
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
department of human services that way
 
02:23:13.110 --> 02:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
there we're sure that some state agency
 
02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
is approving the identity that which
 
02:23:15.510 --> 02:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
they can
 
02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
contract with to provide the information
 
02:23:19.510 --> 02:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
is we're basically got the state police
 
02:23:20.870 --> 02:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
at this point in time
 
02:23:23.110 --> 02:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
which is a state agency and we're not
 
02:23:24.710 --> 02:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
putting something back in to say it has
 
02:23:27.510 --> 02:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
to be go through another agency somehow
 
02:23:29.910 --> 02:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
to be allowed to approve and say okay
 
02:23:31.590 --> 02:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
these companies have been approved by us
 
02:23:33.349 --> 02:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
you can do it that's all so you have
 
02:23:35.349 --> 02:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
some sort of oversight to be sure that
 
02:23:37.590 --> 02:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
what does come back in fact is coming
 
02:23:39.270 --> 02:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
from an organization that has been
 
02:23:41.590 --> 02:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the state to be sure that
 
02:23:43.030 --> 02:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
that point in time what's coming back is
 
02:23:45.990 --> 02:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
in fact what the state's looking for
 
02:23:48.469 --> 02:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
anybody wish to speak to that question
 
02:23:50.070 --> 02:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
then well uh
 
02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
yeah may i respond to that
 
02:23:53.590 --> 02:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
yes just simply
 
02:23:56.150 --> 02:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
this was agreed upon by including dorian
 
02:23:57.270 --> 02:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
shockley who's in charge of the
 
02:23:58.950 --> 02:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
licensing so i think this is what their
 
02:24:01.030 --> 02:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
intention would be she was here for the
 
02:24:03.510 --> 02:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
testimony and worked with the
 
02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
state police on the uh amendment
 
02:24:09.030 --> 02:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
with minahan uh to make sure that that
 
02:24:10.309 --> 02:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
was all there
 
02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
i do not know if we need to go to that
 
02:24:15.270 --> 02:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
level of information that there are
 
02:24:16.870 --> 02:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
people with more seniority than i that
 
02:24:18.389 --> 02:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
could answer that question
 
02:24:22.710 --> 02:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:24:26.710 --> 02:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
yes if we already have some we already
 
02:24:29.110 --> 02:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
have an other rsa
 
02:24:31.670 --> 02:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
who is permitted to
 
02:24:33.830 --> 02:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
grant that who to do the background
 
02:24:36.309 --> 02:24:36.319 align:start position:0%
check we don't have to address it well i
 
02:24:37.990 --> 02:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
mean we're used to using the state
 
02:24:40.469 --> 02:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
police but does anybody else's anybody
 
02:24:44.630 --> 02:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
else already authorized to do that
 
02:24:46.070 --> 02:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
to do the criminal you may answer that
 
02:24:46.080 --> 02:24:47.670 align:start position:0%
to do the criminal you may answer that
representative

02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:24:49.590 --> 02:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
i would assume that they have not
 
02:24:50.950 --> 02:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
because currently it's for the
 
02:24:52.870 --> 02:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
department of safety so new rules would
 
02:24:55.990 --> 02:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
have to be promulgated by the licensure
 
02:24:58.630 --> 02:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
department licensure that would be they
 
02:25:00.870 --> 02:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
would describe how the process would now
 
02:25:02.469 --> 02:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
work that would be done at the rules
 
02:25:02.479 --> 02:25:03.510 align:start position:0%
work that would be done at the rules
level

02:25:03.510 --> 02:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
because they would not have a rule of
 
02:25:06.870 --> 02:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
who else could do it when other places
 
02:25:09.190 --> 02:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
were not currently allowed to do it
 
02:25:12.150 --> 02:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative gay yes uh
 
02:25:14.550 --> 02:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
because of the 90 days now being granted
 
02:25:17.030 --> 02:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
while you're waiting for that does that
 
02:25:20.070 --> 02:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
really mean they don't want to use the
 
02:25:24.150 --> 02:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
they don't use the state police anymore
 
02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:25.349 align:start position:0%
they don't use the state police anymore
representative

02:25:25.349 --> 02:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:25:26.790 --> 02:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
many of them still will use the state
 
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
police the issue is they wanted the
 
02:25:30.389 --> 02:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
flexibility to use other credentialing
 
02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
agents agencies as well that was the
 
02:25:34.230 --> 02:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
point of this as you stated earlier it's
 
02:25:35.830 --> 02:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
to give them more flexibility in how
 
02:25:37.910 --> 02:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
this process is done that is correct and
 
02:25:40.550 --> 02:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
flexibility is best served by rule not
 
02:25:42.870 --> 02:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
by stats by law right yes representative
 
02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:44.870 align:start position:0%

shapiro
 
02:25:47.670 --> 02:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
if i remember correctly which i may not
 
02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:48.550 align:start position:0%
if i remember correctly which i may not
um

02:25:48.550 --> 02:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:50.950 --> 02:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about businesses
 
02:25:54.230 --> 02:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
doing background checks i think it's on
 
02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:59.910 --> 02:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
we were talking about vendors who would
 
02:26:02.230 --> 02:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
then get the background checks done not
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
not businesses or vendors that did the
 
02:26:06.469 --> 02:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
background checks but evidently there
 
02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
are vendors that people can contract
 
02:26:11.030 --> 02:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
with to actually get
 
02:26:12.150 --> 02:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
and i thought they were federal
 
02:26:13.590 --> 02:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
02:26:13.600 --> 02:26:15.750 align:start position:0%
background checks
done

02:26:15.750 --> 02:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:26:17.670 --> 02:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
so it's not it's not necessarily the
 
02:26:19.349 --> 02:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
businesses or vendors that are doing the
 
02:26:21.110 --> 02:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
background checks they are just
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
organizing it
 
02:26:24.870 --> 02:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
that is correct it is uh and i find i
 
02:26:26.309 --> 02:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
found the notes from a discussion last
 
02:26:26.319 --> 02:26:27.110 align:start position:0%
found the notes from a discussion last
night

02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
night
 
02:26:29.830 --> 02:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh it it is it's it is it's basically
 
02:26:31.990 --> 02:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
sets as a condition of employment
 
02:26:33.670 --> 02:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
that they have to do the background
 
02:26:36.550 --> 02:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
check but they the you you're right it's
 
02:26:38.630 --> 02:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
not that the
 
02:26:40.630 --> 02:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
nursing facil nursing home would
 
02:26:42.630 --> 02:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
actually do the background check they
 
02:26:44.469 --> 02:26:44.479 align:start position:0%
would work with a vendor who does a
 
02:26:46.870 --> 02:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
background check and as i say in rules
 
02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
those new rules will need to be
 
02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
promulgated by the licensing authorities
 
02:26:53.030 --> 02:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
anyway as to how that this process would
 
02:26:55.270 --> 02:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
work and they would probably then state
 
02:26:55.280 --> 02:26:56.710 align:start position:0%
work and they would probably then state
which

02:26:56.710 --> 02:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:26:58.230 --> 02:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
vendors could do that
 
02:27:00.389 --> 02:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
 
02:27:04.070 --> 02:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
chairman in my previous life on uh in
 
02:27:05.910 --> 02:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
the financial world i had to be
 
02:27:07.750 --> 02:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
background checked many many times for
 
02:27:09.990 --> 02:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
the sec for finra for all of them my
 
02:27:11.910 --> 02:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
hands were almost always black
 
02:27:13.990 --> 02:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
from the fingerprintings but those were
 
02:27:15.990 --> 02:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
all conducted with private businesses
 
02:27:17.910 --> 02:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
that had all of the clearances in
 
02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
downtown boston the financial district
 
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
we basically went into a vault to do it
 
02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
when i was up here working from
 
02:27:25.830 --> 02:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we'd get the fingerprints
 
02:27:27.750 --> 02:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
done at the local police and then sent
 
02:27:29.990 --> 02:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
in so there already is a good framework
 
02:27:31.990 --> 02:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
for these background checks um i'd argue
 
02:27:33.349 --> 02:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
that these patients are more more
 
02:27:34.950 --> 02:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
vulnerable than money but without the
 
02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
money they also can't stay
 
02:27:39.349 --> 02:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
and keep their their freedom so
 
02:27:41.510 --> 02:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
um i do think that rules would be the
 
02:27:43.110 --> 02:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
best way to do this because it's already
 
02:27:44.469 --> 02:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
done in other industries
 
02:27:46.469 --> 02:27:46.479 align:start position:0%
and they're pro there already probably
 
02:27:48.309 --> 02:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
are some in the state that can step into
 
02:27:50.230 --> 02:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
this role as well
 
02:27:55.030 --> 02:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:57.590 --> 02:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
not to beat a dead horse but i'm just
 
02:28:01.750 --> 02:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
going to flog the poor nag one more time
 
02:28:04.070 --> 02:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
and say all we're doing
 
02:28:07.270 --> 02:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
is changing the choice of form
 
02:28:09.990 --> 02:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
and making it a little more
 
02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:11.110 align:start position:0%
and making it a little more
broad

02:28:11.110 --> 02:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
broad
 
02:28:14.309 --> 02:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
there are no rules to go along with it
 
02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
yet because
 
02:28:19.270 --> 02:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
up till now there was only one way of
 
02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
getting the background check which was
 
02:28:23.670 --> 02:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
one of the barriers to getting people
 
02:28:25.510 --> 02:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
employed and working
 
02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:27.670 align:start position:0%
employed and working
so

02:28:27.670 --> 02:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:28:31.750 --> 02:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
i i'm fervently hoping that this very
 
02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
small change to the bill as it came to
 
02:28:35.760 --> 02:28:37.510 align:start position:0%
small change to the bill as it came to
us

02:28:37.510 --> 02:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:28:39.750 --> 02:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
would be approved
 
02:28:39.760 --> 02:28:40.389 align:start position:0%
would be approved
and

02:28:40.389 --> 02:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:28:43.830 --> 02:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
we could then move on to deal with the
 
02:28:45.270 --> 02:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
bill itself
 
02:28:46.630 --> 02:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to suggest that
 
02:28:49.349 --> 02:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
representative knurk makes a motion on
 
02:28:51.670 --> 02:28:51.680 align:start position:0%

02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:55.990 align:start position:0%

02:29:01.190 --> 02:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative kenner i would be happy
 
02:29:03.510 --> 02:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
to do so i move uh
 
02:29:06.070 --> 02:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
amendment 202 to 0
 
02:29:10.469 --> 02:29:10.479 align:start position:0%

and i'm here today to introduce house
 
03:32:12.150 --> 03:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
bill 1633
 
03:32:14.309 --> 03:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
relative to requiring covet 19
 
03:32:16.790 --> 03:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
vaccination for school attendance
 
03:32:18.790 --> 03:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
i have emailed you all a copy of my
 
03:32:21.510 --> 03:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
testimony as well as an ama document
 
03:32:23.670 --> 03:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
showing how covid19 has become a
 
03:32:26.550 --> 03:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
childhood disease i have one hard copy
 
03:32:28.469 --> 03:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
for the clerk which i will pass up when
 
03:32:30.389 --> 03:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
i'm finished
 
03:32:32.309 --> 03:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
recently a similar bill was filed in
 
03:32:34.630 --> 03:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
california they titled it the keep
 
03:32:37.030 --> 03:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
schools open and safe act
 
03:32:40.070 --> 03:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
that really summarizes the intent here
 
03:32:42.309 --> 03:32:42.319 align:start position:0%
we know vaccination is our best tool for
 
03:32:44.630 --> 03:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
reducing the transmission of covid19 in
 
03:32:46.150 --> 03:32:46.160 align:start position:0%
our schools
 
03:32:48.150 --> 03:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
we know our kids really suffered for the
 
03:32:50.630 --> 03:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
last two years from remote learning
 
03:32:52.550 --> 03:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
both their education and their mental
 
03:32:52.560 --> 03:32:53.990 align:start position:0%
both their education and their mental
health

03:32:53.990 --> 03:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
health
 
03:32:55.590 --> 03:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
we know that they are suffering this
 
03:32:59.030 --> 03:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
year as massive absenteeism among both
 
03:33:01.190 --> 03:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
students and staff is again disrupting
 
03:33:03.030 --> 03:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
their education
 
03:33:05.269 --> 03:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
we know unvaccinated children with covid
 
03:33:07.590 --> 03:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
have been filling pediatric icus across
 
03:33:09.349 --> 03:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
the country
 
03:33:11.110 --> 03:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
covet has caused long-lasting
 
03:33:13.110 --> 03:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
multi-system inflammatory syndrome in
 
03:33:14.710 --> 03:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
other children
 
03:33:16.710 --> 03:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
we know historically we have never
 
03:33:19.030 --> 03:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
controlled any viral disease disrupting
 
03:33:21.910 --> 03:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
our schools without a vaccine mandate
 
03:33:24.150 --> 03:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
the first six diseases for vaccination
 
03:33:27.910 --> 03:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
is required under rsa 141 c20a are
 
03:33:30.550 --> 03:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
specific examples diphtheria mumps
 
03:33:32.630 --> 03:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
pertussis poliomyelitis rubella and
 
03:33:35.030 --> 03:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
rubiola historically all were known to
 
03:33:36.790 --> 03:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
spread in our schools
 
03:33:38.950 --> 03:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
and while the omicron spike is winning
 
03:33:40.950 --> 03:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
we know that the even more contagious
 
03:33:43.349 --> 03:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
ba2 variant is already present in half
 
03:33:45.269 --> 03:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
of u.s states
 
03:33:47.510 --> 03:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is really important to keep
 
03:33:50.550 --> 03:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
our schools open and safe
 
03:33:52.710 --> 03:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
this bill is co-sponsored by every
 
03:33:55.269 --> 03:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
physician in the legislature
 
03:33:57.670 --> 03:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
originally i plan to file it just from
 
03:33:59.910 --> 03:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
the physicians as i had hoped we could
 
03:34:02.389 --> 03:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
pass this in a non-partisan manner but
 
03:34:04.070 --> 03:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seem to be possible right
 
03:34:06.229 --> 03:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
now let's look at the details of the
 
03:34:06.239 --> 03:34:07.429 align:start position:0%
now let's look at the details of the
bill

03:34:07.429 --> 03:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:34:09.349 --> 03:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
section 1 expands the definition of
 
03:34:11.269 --> 03:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
schools in the communicable disease law
 
03:34:14.550 --> 03:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
to include post-secondary education this
 
03:34:16.710 --> 03:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
is intended for two reasons
 
03:34:18.910 --> 03:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
for most of the pandemic we could see on
 
03:34:22.229 --> 03:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
dhhs's map of case counts that the towns
 
03:34:24.070 --> 03:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire hosting universities
 
03:34:26.710 --> 03:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
were epicenters of infection
 
03:34:28.790 --> 03:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
this is intended to mandate coveted
 
03:34:31.750 --> 03:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
vaccination for university attendance
 
03:34:33.670 --> 03:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
most private universities already
 
03:34:35.990 --> 03:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
require this of on-campus students
 
03:34:38.070 --> 03:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
including dartmouth college saint
 
03:34:40.790 --> 03:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
anselm's college colby sawyer college
 
03:34:43.269 --> 03:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
franklin pierce university new england
 
03:34:45.590 --> 03:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
college riviera university and southern
 
03:34:48.790 --> 03:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire university
 
03:34:51.349 --> 03:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
section one also corrects an unintended
 
03:34:53.510 --> 03:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
consequence of last year's house bill
 
03:34:53.520 --> 03:34:54.870 align:start position:0%
consequence of last year's house bill
220.

03:34:54.870 --> 03:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
220.
 
03:34:57.190 --> 03:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
i apologize to this committee
 
03:34:59.590 --> 03:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
because i failed to see this unintended
 
03:35:01.590 --> 03:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
consequence when we were working on this
 
03:35:03.830 --> 03:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
bill last year
 
03:35:06.710 --> 03:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
in 2007 there was an outbreak of
 
03:35:09.269 --> 03:35:09.279 align:start position:0%
meningococcal meningitis on the unh
 
03:35:09.279 --> 03:35:10.630 align:start position:0%
meningococcal meningitis on the unh
campus

03:35:10.630 --> 03:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
campus
 
03:35:13.190 --> 03:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
as i am sure you all know that is a
 
03:35:15.990 --> 03:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
rapidly fatal disease spread easily in
 
03:35:19.190 --> 03:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
the dormitories on college campuses
 
03:35:21.590 --> 03:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
public health controlled that outbreak
 
03:35:23.910 --> 03:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
by mandating by rapidly mandating
 
03:35:26.229 --> 03:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
meningococcal vaccination of all close
 
03:35:26.239 --> 03:35:27.429 align:start position:0%
meningococcal vaccination of all close
contacts

03:35:27.429 --> 03:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
contacts
 
03:35:29.750 --> 03:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
and because of their swift action
 
03:35:32.229 --> 03:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
only one student died
 
03:35:34.070 --> 03:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
a recurrence today would be highly
 
03:35:36.469 --> 03:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
problematic and i'm afraid we would see
 
03:35:39.349 --> 03:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
far more deaths
 
03:35:42.150 --> 03:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
section 2 adds covet 19 to the mandated
 
03:35:44.229 --> 03:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
school vaccination list
 
03:35:46.870 --> 03:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
only when it becomes fully approved by
 
03:35:48.790 --> 03:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
the fda
 
03:35:52.309 --> 03:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
right now that means ages 16 and up as
 
03:35:54.070 --> 03:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
further data becomes available and
 
03:35:56.070 --> 03:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinations become fully approved at
 
03:35:58.710 --> 03:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
younger ages that age is likely to move
 
03:36:00.550 --> 03:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
downward without further action by the
 
03:36:00.560 --> 03:36:02.710 align:start position:0%
downward without further action by the
legislature

03:36:02.710 --> 03:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
03:36:05.269 --> 03:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
sections 3 and 4 contingently repeal the
 
03:36:06.870 --> 03:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
section limiting the requirement to
 
03:36:09.110 --> 03:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
vaccines fully approved by the fda once
 
03:36:13.269 --> 03:36:13.279 align:start position:0%
a vaccine exists without age restriction
 
03:36:15.110 --> 03:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
i urge you to recommend this common
 
03:36:17.349 --> 03:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
sense measure ought to pass i will be
 
03:36:19.429 --> 03:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
glad to take questions i will tell you
 
03:36:21.590 --> 03:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
that i have to return to edna for an
 
03:36:23.830 --> 03:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
executive session fairly promptly
 
03:36:25.670 --> 03:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that thank you
 
03:36:29.110 --> 03:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative martian welcome back
 
03:36:30.710 --> 03:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
glad to see you
 
03:36:33.750 --> 03:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
any questions for the representative
 
03:36:36.389 --> 03:36:36.399 align:start position:0%
representative acton
 
03:36:37.910 --> 03:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
03:36:41.349 --> 03:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:43.830 --> 03:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
will there be any um provisions in this
 
03:36:47.510 --> 03:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
for natural immunity my my daughter
 
03:36:49.990 --> 03:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
had covered two weeks ago and
 
03:36:51.349 --> 03:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
was sick for
 
03:36:53.670 --> 03:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
about 12 hours and then she's back to
 
03:36:55.590 --> 03:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
normal but had to miss considerable
 
03:36:57.429 --> 03:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
amount of school
 
03:37:00.070 --> 03:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
now she has natural immunities are there
 
03:37:02.389 --> 03:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
will there be any provisions
 
03:37:04.150 --> 03:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
in this for her to
 
03:37:06.790 --> 03:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
avoid being vaccinated we wrote this
 
03:37:09.750 --> 03:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
bill intending that the
 
03:37:12.550 --> 03:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
exact vaccination requirement how many
 
03:37:14.469 --> 03:37:14.479 align:start position:0%
shots when they be needed what age they
 
03:37:16.309 --> 03:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
would need could be expanded upon in the
 
03:37:17.990 --> 03:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
rules as you all know these things
 
03:37:19.750 --> 03:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
change and usually this committee does
 
03:37:21.349 --> 03:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
not tell the medical professionals how
 
03:37:22.870 --> 03:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
to do their own job
 
03:37:25.590 --> 03:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding of natural immunity
 
03:37:27.750 --> 03:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
is it does not occur in all cases and it
 
03:37:29.750 --> 03:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
also tends to wade after three to six
 
03:37:29.760 --> 03:37:30.630 align:start position:0%
also tends to wade after three to six
months

03:37:30.630 --> 03:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
months
 
03:37:30.640 --> 03:37:31.429 align:start position:0%
months
so

03:37:31.429 --> 03:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:37:33.269 --> 03:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
i i think that that would be pertinent
 
03:37:34.950 --> 03:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i ask you to keep ordering
 
03:37:37.590 --> 03:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:39.190 --> 03:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
i think that would be highly pertinent
 
03:37:41.030 --> 03:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
and of course as further data comes
 
03:37:43.590 --> 03:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
forward that would be rather pertinent
 
03:37:44.790 --> 03:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
as well
 
03:37:47.510 --> 03:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative kelsey
 
03:37:48.870 --> 03:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:37:51.110 --> 03:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question um do we have the
 
03:37:54.229 --> 03:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
data on the vaccine immunity like what
 
03:37:56.870 --> 03:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
the va what the vaccinated vaccination
 
03:37:59.990 --> 03:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
immunity time frame is
 
03:38:01.910 --> 03:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i understand your question
 
03:38:03.590 --> 03:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
i think that may be a better question
 
03:38:07.110 --> 03:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
posed to some of the to dhhs and some of
 
03:38:08.790 --> 03:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
the other people who may testify after
 
03:38:12.389 --> 03:38:12.399 align:start position:0%
me okay thank you
 
03:38:14.950 --> 03:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
leon thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
03:38:16.389 --> 03:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
representative marsh for taking the
 
03:38:18.469 --> 03:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
question um i see that you are
 
03:38:20.550 --> 03:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
indicating that only those vaccines that
 
03:38:22.630 --> 03:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
are fully approved by the fda would be
 
03:38:25.110 --> 03:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
required um would you intend this to
 
03:38:27.429 --> 03:38:27.439 align:start position:0%
wait until comiarti which is the
 
03:38:29.910 --> 03:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
approved one is actually available for
 
03:38:32.790 --> 03:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
use in the united states or are you
 
03:38:34.790 --> 03:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
willing to allow essentially the
 
03:38:37.429 --> 03:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
biosimilars to those to be used even
 
03:38:39.189 --> 03:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
though they don't have specific fda
 
03:38:41.750 --> 03:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
approval i i think that the rule making
 
03:38:46.710 --> 03:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:50.389 --> 03:38:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:54.950 --> 03:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative marsh um
 
03:38:57.110 --> 03:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
on a local level local school boards
 
03:38:59.429 --> 03:38:59.439 align:start position:0%
local universities rather than having
 
03:39:02.309 --> 03:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
statewide legislation
 
03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's ever been done in
 
03:39:05.590 --> 03:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire generally if
 
03:39:07.110 --> 03:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
vaccines are going to be required for
 
03:39:08.550 --> 03:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
school attendance we add them to the
 
03:39:09.990 --> 03:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
list you and i have both been on this
 
03:39:11.429 --> 03:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
committee long enough that we know other
 
03:39:14.389 --> 03:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
examples where that's been uh considered
 
03:39:16.950 --> 03:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up please mr chairman
 
03:39:20.469 --> 03:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um we're putting kovid 19
 
03:39:22.469 --> 03:39:22.479 align:start position:0%
into the legislation
 
03:39:25.510 --> 03:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
is it possible that covet 19 will in
 
03:39:29.349 --> 03:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:31.750 --> 03:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
you're the epidemiologist and i am not i
 
03:39:33.110 --> 03:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
know that you're of the opinion that
 
03:39:34.950 --> 03:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
this will become endemic which to my
 
03:39:37.110 --> 03:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
mind means a low level of chronic
 
03:39:37.120 --> 03:39:38.150 align:start position:0%
mind means a low level of chronic
cases

03:39:38.150 --> 03:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
cases
 
03:39:40.070 --> 03:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
my belief is that it's more likely to
 
03:39:42.630 --> 03:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
come in waves like other diseases have
 
03:39:44.630 --> 03:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
in the past and we can have that debate
 
03:39:46.309 --> 03:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
another time it's not pertinent to this
 
03:39:46.319 --> 03:39:47.990 align:start position:0%
another time it's not pertinent to this
bill

03:39:47.990 --> 03:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:39:49.429 --> 03:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
 
03:39:51.830 --> 03:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative erica excuse me
 
03:39:53.910 --> 03:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
 
03:39:55.990 --> 03:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
chairman this is a friendly committee my
 
03:39:57.910 --> 03:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
other question was about
 
03:39:59.750 --> 03:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
applying this to schools like dartmouth
 
03:40:01.830 --> 03:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned they actually pre-date
 
03:40:04.469 --> 03:40:04.479 align:start position:0%
our country and so the rights of what
 
03:40:06.710 --> 03:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
dartmouth does are carved out pretty
 
03:40:06.720 --> 03:40:07.510 align:start position:0%
dartmouth does are carved out pretty
well

03:40:07.510 --> 03:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:40:09.750 --> 03:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
i'm curious how how you view the
 
03:40:12.070 --> 03:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
legislature having the authority to tell
 
03:40:15.349 --> 03:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
dartmouth college what to do
 
03:40:17.110 --> 03:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question as you may
 
03:40:19.030 --> 03:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
know i am an alumnus of dartmouth
 
03:40:21.189 --> 03:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
college and the dartmouth college case
 
03:40:23.349 --> 03:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
was one of the early cases that defined
 
03:40:25.189 --> 03:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
the roles of the united states supreme
 
03:40:27.750 --> 03:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
court i think that the exact rights that
 
03:40:29.910 --> 03:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
dartmouth college has has been very much
 
03:40:31.670 --> 03:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
been under debate since the founding of
 
03:40:34.150 --> 03:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
this country and the passage of this
 
03:40:36.229 --> 03:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
bill will not change that
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
03:40:41.189 --> 03:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman pearson thank you for
 
03:40:43.110 --> 03:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:40:45.269 --> 03:40:45.279 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of rolling off of
 
03:40:47.990 --> 03:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative leon's question
 
03:40:49.110 --> 03:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
03:40:51.349 --> 03:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm not reading it right but
 
03:40:53.910 --> 03:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
are you also going to mandate feel that
 
03:40:55.990 --> 03:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
this should be mandated for private
 
03:40:56.000 --> 03:40:58.870 align:start position:0%
this should be mandated for private
schools

03:40:58.870 --> 03:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:02.150 --> 03:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
i think that diseases can uh spread in
 
03:41:04.229 --> 03:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
private schools as well i don't think
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
that i'm the person to ask as to whether
 
03:41:08.150 --> 03:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
this specific statute applies to private
 
03:41:09.349 --> 03:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
schools i think you should ask that
 
03:41:11.349 --> 03:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
question of dhhs
 
03:41:13.510 --> 03:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative marsh on line two it says
 
03:41:15.910 --> 03:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
school means any
 
03:41:18.150 --> 03:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
facility i think that question is
 
03:41:20.950 --> 03:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
answered here in our bill i think that
 
03:41:22.389 --> 03:41:22.399 align:start position:0%
that would be an appropriate answer to
 
03:41:23.830 --> 03:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
the question but they can tell you how
 
03:41:25.510 --> 03:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
they are applying the law at present
 
03:41:26.950 --> 03:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
regarding other vaccines that are
 
03:41:28.229 --> 03:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
mandated by the state of nature i
 
03:41:29.910 --> 03:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate your answer thank you sir
 
03:41:32.870 --> 03:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:34.229 --> 03:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:41:36.070 --> 03:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
03:41:39.429 --> 03:41:39.439 align:start position:0%
say hi to edna force
 
03:41:41.189 --> 03:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
the chair calls representative jerry
 
03:41:43.269 --> 03:41:43.279 align:start position:0%
kanerk from this committee has written
 
03:41:58.870 --> 03:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:00.950 --> 03:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i distributed the
 
03:42:02.469 --> 03:42:02.479 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
03:42:08.710 --> 03:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:08.720 --> 03:42:09.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:42:09.590 --> 03:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:42:11.510 --> 03:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
yes i'm for the record representative
 
03:42:13.110 --> 03:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
jerry canuck representing carroll county
 
03:42:16.630 --> 03:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
district 3 and a retired surgeon
 
03:42:18.229 --> 03:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
i agree with representative marsh that
 
03:42:19.910 --> 03:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
vaccination is our best tool for
 
03:42:22.710 --> 03:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
reducing the transmission of covet 19 in
 
03:42:25.189 --> 03:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
our schools in order to minimize closure
 
03:42:28.389 --> 03:42:28.399 align:start position:0%
and absenteeism of teachers and pupils
 
03:42:30.309 --> 03:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
a high level of vaccination is also very
 
03:42:32.950 --> 03:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
important to protect those vulnerable
 
03:42:32.960 --> 03:42:34.229 align:start position:0%
important to protect those vulnerable
individuals

03:42:34.229 --> 03:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
03:42:35.750 --> 03:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
who are medically unable to be
 
03:42:37.269 --> 03:42:37.279 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and those who are
 
03:42:37.279 --> 03:42:38.469 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and those who are
immunosuppressed

03:42:38.469 --> 03:42:38.479 align:start position:0%
immunosuppressed
 
03:42:39.910 --> 03:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
they may not be able to mount good
 
03:42:42.070 --> 03:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
response to the vaccine or to the
 
03:42:42.080 --> 03:42:44.150 align:start position:0%
response to the vaccine or to the
infection

03:42:44.150 --> 03:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
infection
 
03:42:45.910 --> 03:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
my job today is to concentrate on
 
03:42:47.670 --> 03:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
clarifying some of the misunderstandings
 
03:42:49.110 --> 03:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
of the science
 
03:42:50.710 --> 03:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
which have been prevalent and stated in
 
03:42:53.030 --> 03:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
our committee this year and the enormous
 
03:42:55.269 --> 03:42:55.279 align:start position:0%
number of emails that we have received
 
03:42:57.189 --> 03:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
because our policy decisions even though
 
03:42:59.189 --> 03:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
we may disagree on that must be based on
 
03:43:02.150 --> 03:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
facts and not disinformation
 
03:43:03.189 --> 03:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
some people have contended the
 
03:43:05.189 --> 03:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
vaccination does not work based upon the
 
03:43:06.550 --> 03:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
fact that if you have a breakthrough
 
03:43:08.389 --> 03:43:08.399 align:start position:0%
infection you can still transmit the
 
03:43:08.399 --> 03:43:09.590 align:start position:0%
infection you can still transmit the
virus

03:43:09.590 --> 03:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
virus
 
03:43:12.550 --> 03:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
well that's true at the individual level
 
03:43:14.710 --> 03:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
it is not true in the aggregate or the
 
03:43:17.110 --> 03:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
whole population level
 
03:43:18.950 --> 03:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
since vaccination decreases the rate of
 
03:43:22.070 --> 03:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
infection it decreases population level
 
03:43:22.080 --> 03:43:23.510 align:start position:0%
infection it decreases population level
transmission

03:43:23.510 --> 03:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
03:43:25.429 --> 03:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
then vaccinated are formerly far more
 
03:43:26.950 --> 03:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
likely to get infected in the first
 
03:43:26.960 --> 03:43:28.070 align:start position:0%
likely to get infected in the first
place

03:43:28.070 --> 03:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
place
 
03:43:29.670 --> 03:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
the data and this varies some data from
 
03:43:32.469 --> 03:43:32.479 align:start position:0%
january said a seven fold increase in uh
 
03:43:34.630 --> 03:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated getting infected recent
 
03:43:35.990 --> 03:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
data from washington state shows a
 
03:43:37.670 --> 03:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
three-fold increase in the infection
 
03:43:39.429 --> 03:43:39.439 align:start position:0%
rate and vaccinated versus
 
03:43:41.670 --> 03:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
unbacked sorry in the unvaccinated
 
03:43:43.830 --> 03:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
versus vaccinated in the age group 12 to
 
03:43:43.840 --> 03:43:44.950 align:start position:0%
versus vaccinated in the age group 12 to
34

03:43:44.950 --> 03:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
34
 
03:43:47.670 --> 03:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
even with omicron
 
03:43:49.750 --> 03:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
so though the risk of transition by an
 
03:43:52.389 --> 03:43:52.399 align:start position:0%
individual with breakthrough infection
 
03:43:52.399 --> 03:43:53.910 align:start position:0%
individual with breakthrough infection
persists

03:43:53.910 --> 03:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
persists
 
03:43:55.910 --> 03:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
the risk of transmission transmission at
 
03:43:57.990 --> 03:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
the population level
 
03:43:59.590 --> 03:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
which is what we're interested in will
 
03:44:02.469 --> 03:44:02.479 align:start position:0%
still be lower because many fewer people
 
03:44:04.550 --> 03:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
will be infected and therefore able to
 
03:44:07.189 --> 03:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
transmit the virus
 
03:44:09.030 --> 03:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
additionally vaccinated people who do
 
03:44:10.469 --> 03:44:10.479 align:start position:0%
have a breakthrough infection have an
 
03:44:12.550 --> 03:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
accelerated viral clearance that means
 
03:44:14.550 --> 03:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
they get rid of it faster
 
03:44:16.070 --> 03:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
than those who were unvaccinated that
 
03:44:17.750 --> 03:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
makes them infectious for a much shorter
 
03:44:20.150 --> 03:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
period of time therefore decreasing
 
03:44:20.160 --> 03:44:21.189 align:start position:0%
period of time therefore decreasing
further

03:44:21.189 --> 03:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
further
 
03:44:23.189 --> 03:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
the population level transmission so you
 
03:44:23.199 --> 03:44:24.389 align:start position:0%
the population level transmission so you
combine

03:44:24.389 --> 03:44:24.399 align:start position:0%
combine
 
03:44:25.830 --> 03:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
the decreased number of people who are
 
03:44:25.840 --> 03:44:26.870 align:start position:0%
the decreased number of people who are
infected

03:44:26.870 --> 03:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
infected
 
03:44:28.550 --> 03:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
with the acceleration of the variable
 
03:44:30.309 --> 03:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
clearance and the bottom line is the
 
03:44:32.229 --> 03:44:32.239 align:start position:0%
covered vaccination will
 
03:44:32.239 --> 03:44:33.349 align:start position:0%
covered vaccination will
decrease

03:44:33.349 --> 03:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
03:44:35.269 --> 03:44:35.279 align:start position:0%
the chance of transmission on a
 
03:44:37.110 --> 03:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
population level even though the
 
03:44:39.189 --> 03:44:39.199 align:start position:0%
individual person transmission may still
 
03:44:39.199 --> 03:44:40.790 align:start position:0%
individual person transmission may still
occur

03:44:40.790 --> 03:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
occur
 
03:44:42.229 --> 03:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
the next you've heard it contended that
 
03:44:44.550 --> 03:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
the vaccine doesn't work if we look at
 
03:44:46.389 --> 03:44:46.399 align:start position:0%
an early study of over 2000 adolescents
 
03:44:48.710 --> 03:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
there was initial study ages 12 to 15 it
 
03:44:50.710 --> 03:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
showed a remarkably high efficacy after
 
03:44:52.070 --> 03:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
two doses
 
03:44:54.630 --> 03:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
with regard to infection
 
03:44:56.150 --> 03:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
not talking about you know illness and
 
03:44:57.990 --> 03:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
so on but just infection at a hundred
 
03:44:59.510 --> 03:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
percent which is a bit unusual but
 
03:45:01.510 --> 03:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
that's because with only two thousand
 
03:45:03.510 --> 03:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
that it can have that kind of a number
 
03:45:04.950 --> 03:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
which is probably a little bit less with
 
03:45:04.960 --> 03:45:05.830 align:start position:0%
which is probably a little bit less with
more

03:45:05.830 --> 03:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:45:07.670 --> 03:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
but no cases in the vaccinated group in
 
03:45:09.750 --> 03:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
18 cases amongst the placebo and no
 
03:45:09.760 --> 03:45:11.030 align:start position:0%
18 cases amongst the placebo and no
deaths

03:45:11.030 --> 03:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
03:45:13.269 --> 03:45:13.279 align:start position:0%
a more recent study was done in response
 
03:45:16.229 --> 03:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
to the surge of omicron looking at 1400
 
03:45:18.229 --> 03:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
children ages 12 to 18. it was published
 
03:45:19.750 --> 03:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
just in january
 
03:45:21.990 --> 03:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
and it demonstrated a 94
 
03:45:23.830 --> 03:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
protection against hospitalization and
 
03:45:26.950 --> 03:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
98 protection against icu admission with
 
03:45:30.070 --> 03:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
all deaths occurring in the unvaccinated
 
03:45:31.750 --> 03:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
now the big thing you've heard it
 
03:45:33.510 --> 03:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
multiple times including even today
 
03:45:35.349 --> 03:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
incorrect statements about the number of
 
03:45:37.030 --> 03:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
deaths due to covet vaccine from the
 
03:45:39.670 --> 03:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine adverse events reporting system
 
03:45:39.680 --> 03:45:40.790 align:start position:0%

03:45:42.950 --> 03:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
it is precisely that it is a reporting
 
03:45:42.960 --> 03:45:43.990 align:start position:0%
it is precisely that it is a reporting

03:45:43.990 --> 03:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:45:47.429 --> 03:45:47.439 align:start position:0%
it is not a causal system it's important
 
03:45:49.429 --> 03:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
to note that all
 
03:45:51.670 --> 03:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
deaths following vaccine administration
 
03:45:53.510 --> 03:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
must be reported to bears
 
03:45:57.030 --> 03:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
even if not related to the vaccine
 
03:45:58.550 --> 03:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
if a child drowns a week after a
 
03:46:00.070 --> 03:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
vaccination that has to be reported as
 
03:46:03.030 --> 03:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
an adverse effect event
 
03:46:04.790 --> 03:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
there's a clear disclaimer on the vares
 
03:46:06.469 --> 03:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
data that shows that a report in various
 
03:46:09.030 --> 03:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
does not imply causality
 
03:46:11.429 --> 03:46:11.439 align:start position:0%
it is purely coincidence
 
03:46:13.189 --> 03:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
every adverse effect event is
 
03:46:15.110 --> 03:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
investigated in order to determine
 
03:46:15.120 --> 03:46:16.389 align:start position:0%
investigated in order to determine
causality

03:46:16.389 --> 03:46:16.399 align:start position:0%
causality
 
03:46:18.150 --> 03:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
that's how for example we found the link
 
03:46:19.269 --> 03:46:19.279 align:start position:0%
between thrombosis throughout
 
03:46:21.110 --> 03:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
hydrocytopenia syndrome with the j j
 
03:46:23.189 --> 03:46:23.199 align:start position:0%
vaccine that was confirmed it led to
 
03:46:25.269 --> 03:46:25.279 align:start position:0%
warnings for that age group and a
 
03:46:27.750 --> 03:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation to use the mrna vaccines
 
03:46:27.760 --> 03:46:29.269 align:start position:0%
recommendation to use the mrna vaccines
instead

03:46:29.269 --> 03:46:29.279 align:start position:0%
instead
 
03:46:31.590 --> 03:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
the system works
 
03:46:33.030 --> 03:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
so the fact that there may be a death
 
03:46:35.990 --> 03:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
reported does not means it's causal
 
03:46:37.910 --> 03:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
you all got an email i think two days
 
03:46:37.920 --> 03:46:38.710 align:start position:0%
you all got an email i think two days
ago

03:46:38.710 --> 03:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
ago
 
03:46:40.309 --> 03:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
claiming that a
 
03:46:42.150 --> 03:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
15 year old here in the state who was
 
03:46:44.790 --> 03:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
reportedly a nephew or something of
 
03:46:46.389 --> 03:46:46.399 align:start position:0%
congressman pappas
 
03:46:49.429 --> 03:46:49.439 align:start position:0%
hadn't had his in uh had his vaccine and
 
03:46:52.389 --> 03:46:52.399 align:start position:0%
then well swimming died a week later and
 
03:46:54.229 --> 03:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
they even linked to the various report
 
03:46:55.349 --> 03:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how many of you read the
 
03:46:57.349 --> 03:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
autopsy report i did
 
03:46:59.670 --> 03:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
the only relevant finding was thickening
 
03:47:02.710 --> 03:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
of the left ventricular wall
 
03:47:04.389 --> 03:47:04.399 align:start position:0%
and if you've gone to the gym you'll
 
03:47:05.670 --> 03:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
find that in one week you're not going
 
03:47:07.670 --> 03:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
to get bulging muscles that takes a lot
 
03:47:09.349 --> 03:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
of time that is not related to the
 
03:47:09.359 --> 03:47:11.030 align:start position:0%
of time that is not related to the
vaccine

03:47:11.030 --> 03:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
03:47:13.110 --> 03:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
that person had hypertrophic
 
03:47:14.950 --> 03:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
cardiomyopathy which is a well-known
 
03:47:16.950 --> 03:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
problem in young adolescent
 
03:47:18.870 --> 03:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
and young men
 
03:47:20.309 --> 03:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
with sports which is one of the reasons
 
03:47:22.070 --> 03:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
why we we think one of the reasons why
 
03:47:24.309 --> 03:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
we often see sudden death in
 
03:47:26.309 --> 03:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
high performance athletes it's one of
 
03:47:28.710 --> 03:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
the postulated mechanisms
 
03:47:30.469 --> 03:47:30.479 align:start position:0%
so there it is the person is claiming it
 
03:47:32.150 --> 03:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
to death from the vaccine because they
 
03:47:34.070 --> 03:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
got they died afterward
 
03:47:36.229 --> 03:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
jumped in the lake he swam
 
03:47:37.429 --> 03:47:37.439 align:start position:0%
he died
 
03:47:39.429 --> 03:47:39.439 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the vaccine
 
03:47:39.439 --> 03:47:41.110 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the vaccine
period

03:47:41.110 --> 03:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
period
 
03:47:43.110 --> 03:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
now if we look at the original study
 
03:47:43.120 --> 03:47:43.990 align:start position:0%
now if we look at the original study
of

03:47:43.990 --> 03:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:47:47.510 --> 03:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
all the patients 43 000 this is the
 
03:47:50.150 --> 03:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
initial eua study
 
03:47:51.990 --> 03:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
and you look at the adverse events
 
03:47:54.150 --> 03:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
they're a lot
 
03:47:55.910 --> 03:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
but there were for example
 
03:47:57.189 --> 03:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
life threatening
 
03:47:59.429 --> 03:47:59.439 align:start position:0%
in the vaccine group there were 21 there
 
03:48:01.590 --> 03:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
were 23 in the placebo group
 
03:48:04.309 --> 03:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
deaths 2 in the vaccine group 4 in the
 
03:48:06.309 --> 03:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
placebo group
 
03:48:09.189 --> 03:48:09.199 align:start position:0%
so a report does not mean it's causal
 
03:48:10.630 --> 03:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
because we saw actually more in the
 
03:48:13.189 --> 03:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
placebo group that doesn't mean
 
03:48:15.990 --> 03:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
that placebo caused them to die it's
 
03:48:17.990 --> 03:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
just simply looking at the numbers and
 
03:48:19.590 --> 03:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
you have to actually correlate and look
 
03:48:21.830 --> 03:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
for causality
 
03:48:24.389 --> 03:48:24.399 align:start position:0%
the best full cdc data i can find for
 
03:48:24.399 --> 03:48:26.070 align:start position:0%
the best full cdc data i can find for
kids

03:48:26.070 --> 03:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
kids
 
03:48:28.790 --> 03:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
covers a period from december 20 to july
 
03:48:28.800 --> 03:48:30.229 align:start position:0%
covers a period from december 20 to july
2021

03:48:30.229 --> 03:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
2021
 
03:48:33.750 --> 03:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
and as of july 16 2021 8.9 million
 
03:48:33.760 --> 03:48:35.110 align:start position:0%
and as of july 16 2021 8.9 million
adolescents

03:48:35.110 --> 03:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
adolescents
 
03:48:37.349 --> 03:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
ages 12 to 17 had been vaccinated and
 
03:48:40.630 --> 03:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
there were 14 reports of death to theirs
 
03:48:41.910 --> 03:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
but if you look at the pattern of
 
03:48:44.070 --> 03:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
reported deaths it was not suggestive of
 
03:48:46.550 --> 03:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
a causal relationship
 
03:48:47.990 --> 03:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
although the full data was still pending
 
03:48:49.910 --> 03:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
on a few for example two deaths were due
 
03:48:51.269 --> 03:48:51.279 align:start position:0%
to suicide that's the third leading
 
03:48:53.349 --> 03:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
cause of death in adolescence already
 
03:48:55.510 --> 03:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
not related to vaccine
 
03:48:57.510 --> 03:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
and if you look and i've dug this up if
 
03:48:59.269 --> 03:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
you look at the annual death rate in the
 
03:49:02.950 --> 03:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
group of ages 12 to 19 historically
 
03:49:04.550 --> 03:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with covet nothing to do
 
03:49:05.990 --> 03:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
with vaccines
 
03:49:09.030 --> 03:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
50 kids in that age group per 100 000
 
03:49:11.349 --> 03:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
will die per year
 
03:49:13.670 --> 03:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
therefore if you took that 8.9 million
 
03:49:15.590 --> 03:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
kids you looked over seven months you'd
 
03:49:15.600 --> 03:49:16.429 align:start position:0%
kids you looked over seven months you'd
expect

03:49:16.429 --> 03:49:16.439 align:start position:0%
expect
 
03:49:19.189 --> 03:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
2595 deaths that would occur
 
03:49:21.910 --> 03:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
that's the background noise
 
03:49:24.710 --> 03:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
so when somebody dies in a week two
 
03:49:26.229 --> 03:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
weeks whatever after a vaccine it
 
03:49:28.150 --> 03:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it came from the vaccine
 
03:49:29.750 --> 03:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
until you can actually
 
03:49:31.030 --> 03:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
look at the record
 
03:49:33.189 --> 03:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
look at the autopsy find out why that
 
03:49:35.189 --> 03:49:35.199 align:start position:0%
person really died so when people keep
 
03:49:37.349 --> 03:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
spouting out numbers and bears
 
03:49:38.550 --> 03:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
it means
 
03:49:38.560 --> 03:49:39.830 align:start position:0%
it means
nothing

03:49:39.830 --> 03:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
03:49:42.309 --> 03:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
it is a reporting system to give us
 
03:49:42.319 --> 03:49:44.070 align:start position:0%
it is a reporting system to give us
information

03:49:44.070 --> 03:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:49:46.550 --> 03:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
because that is how we do find
 
03:49:48.229 --> 03:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
the signal that there may be a problem
 
03:49:50.110 --> 03:49:50.120 align:start position:0%
such as in ttp
 
03:49:52.389 --> 03:49:52.399 align:start position:0%
thrombocytopenia thrombosis
 
03:49:52.399 --> 03:49:53.349 align:start position:0%
thrombocytopenia thrombosis
syndrome

03:49:53.349 --> 03:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
syndrome
 
03:49:54.710 --> 03:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
because indeed it was found that that
 
03:49:56.150 --> 03:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
was particularly young people and it did
 
03:49:57.670 --> 03:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
exceed the natural history of that
 
03:49:57.680 --> 03:49:59.429 align:start position:0%
exceed the natural history of that
disease

03:49:59.429 --> 03:49:59.439 align:start position:0%
disease
 
03:50:01.030 --> 03:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's also been said that covet doesn't
 
03:50:03.349 --> 03:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
affect kids but that's not true
 
03:50:05.510 --> 03:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
more than 700 kids under 18 have died of
 
03:50:08.870 --> 03:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
covid and as of october 20 21 nearly 1
 
03:50:10.550 --> 03:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
000 sorry sorry
 
03:50:13.189 --> 03:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
100 deaths from covid in the age group 5
 
03:50:15.189 --> 03:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
to 11 have been reported covet actually
 
03:50:17.510 --> 03:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
ranks in the top 10 causes of death for
 
03:50:19.750 --> 03:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
kids ages 5 to 11.
 
03:50:22.630 --> 03:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
so it is not a non-problem
 
03:50:23.830 --> 03:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
and the comment was just made about
 
03:50:23.840 --> 03:50:25.349 align:start position:0%
and the comment was just made about
community

03:50:25.349 --> 03:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
community
 
03:50:28.229 --> 03:50:28.239 align:start position:0%
commonity is precisely the same
 
03:50:32.150 --> 03:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
as the eua formulation
 
03:50:33.429 --> 03:50:33.439 align:start position:0%
it is simply
 
03:50:35.670 --> 03:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
you would use up the old stuff
 
03:50:37.750 --> 03:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
in the vials before you start going to
 
03:50:39.429 --> 03:50:39.439 align:start position:0%
the new stuff that has a label with a
 
03:50:41.189 --> 03:50:41.199 align:start position:0%
different name
 
03:50:42.630 --> 03:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
several months ago when i bought a box
 
03:50:44.870 --> 03:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
of cheerios it was called cherry oats
 
03:50:46.950 --> 03:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
they were harkening back to 40 years ago
 
03:50:48.229 --> 03:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
when that's what they used to call it i
 
03:50:49.429 --> 03:50:49.439 align:start position:0%
didn't run right home and grab the
 
03:50:51.429 --> 03:50:51.439 align:start position:0%
cheerios in my closet and throw them
 
03:50:53.990 --> 03:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
down the drain because they're now
 
03:50:55.590 --> 03:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
not labeled the same
 
03:50:58.389 --> 03:50:58.399 align:start position:0%
because they're the exact same thing
 
03:51:00.790 --> 03:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
this is the corneality and what was done
 
03:51:02.870 --> 03:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
for the eua which is in other vials
 
03:51:04.630 --> 03:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
without with a with a different number
 
03:51:07.269 --> 03:51:07.279 align:start position:0%
pfizer bnt a bunch of numbers it's the
 
03:51:09.429 --> 03:51:09.439 align:start position:0%
same stuff you don't throw away a good
 
03:51:10.950 --> 03:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine so you can just use the stuff
 
03:51:13.349 --> 03:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
that has a different label
 
03:51:15.590 --> 03:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
so in summary the vaccine is safe it is
 
03:51:17.030 --> 03:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
effective we need to increase the
 
03:51:17.040 --> 03:51:18.389 align:start position:0%
effective we need to increase the
vaccination

03:51:18.389 --> 03:51:18.399 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
03:51:20.710 --> 03:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
rate in our kids to protect those who
 
03:51:23.269 --> 03:51:23.279 align:start position:0%
cannot be vaccinated
 
03:51:26.229 --> 03:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'll take questions
 
03:51:26.239 --> 03:51:27.990 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'll take questions
questions

03:51:27.990 --> 03:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:51:31.830 --> 03:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative king
 
03:51:33.990 --> 03:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
03:51:37.349 --> 03:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
03:51:37.359 --> 03:51:39.510 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
um

03:51:39.510 --> 03:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:41.429 --> 03:51:41.439 align:start position:0%
i appreciate what what you talked about
 
03:51:43.670 --> 03:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
with vares and the numbers not really
 
03:51:45.510 --> 03:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
meaning anything
 
03:51:48.229 --> 03:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
could we apply the same logic to
 
03:51:50.950 --> 03:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
the covid number the covid deaths before
 
03:51:52.309 --> 03:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
the vaccine
 
03:51:54.630 --> 03:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
where people were dying of cancer
 
03:51:56.070 --> 03:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
in old age
 
03:51:57.590 --> 03:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
but if they had covid they were
 
03:52:00.710 --> 03:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
considered covet related deaths
 
03:52:02.389 --> 03:52:02.399 align:start position:0%
okay that's something that is often
 
03:52:03.910 --> 03:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
spotted about in terms of the adult
 
03:52:05.510 --> 03:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
saying that only people really died of
 
03:52:08.309 --> 03:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
covet because they had no comorbidities
 
03:52:10.389 --> 03:52:10.399 align:start position:0%
um i i have some comorbidities i have
 
03:52:12.870 --> 03:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
hypertension and if i happen to have a
 
03:52:15.269 --> 03:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
heart attack i died of my heart attack i
 
03:52:16.710 --> 03:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
didn't die of hypertension but it was
 
03:52:19.030 --> 03:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
contributing probably
 
03:52:20.469 --> 03:52:20.479 align:start position:0%
the point of the matter is if somebody
 
03:52:22.630 --> 03:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
happens to have
 
03:52:24.950 --> 03:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
obesity and diabetes
 
03:52:26.150 --> 03:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
and they're walking around perfectly
 
03:52:27.429 --> 03:52:27.439 align:start position:0%
fine i would dare say a number of people
 
03:52:29.590 --> 03:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
in this room have diabetes
 
03:52:32.469 --> 03:52:32.479 align:start position:0%
they're not going to die tonight
 
03:52:34.229 --> 03:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
but if they get coveted and then they
 
03:52:35.830 --> 03:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
develop pneumonia and they're on a
 
03:52:38.150 --> 03:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
ventilator and they die they died
 
03:52:40.550 --> 03:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
because of covid they didn't die because
 
03:52:42.870 --> 03:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
they had diabetes that is an underlying
 
03:52:44.630 --> 03:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
predisposing condition
 
03:52:46.229 --> 03:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
but it is not the cause of death i've
 
03:52:48.070 --> 03:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
filled out death certificates
 
03:52:49.990 --> 03:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
and you do you have to put down all the
 
03:52:51.750 --> 03:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
various factors
 
03:52:53.269 --> 03:52:53.279 align:start position:0%
but the cause of death is what killed
 
03:52:55.590 --> 03:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
you so when we say that though they had
 
03:52:58.150 --> 03:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
these other diseases it doesn't matter
 
03:53:01.670 --> 03:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:03.189 --> 03:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
by the way i didn't say the verse is not
 
03:53:05.590 --> 03:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't count it counts a lot that's how
 
03:53:07.910 --> 03:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
you do get it but you can't say it's
 
03:53:09.590 --> 03:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
causal you have to look at it then
 
03:53:11.110 --> 03:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
investigate it you don't take the raw
 
03:53:13.110 --> 03:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
data thank you
 
03:53:13.120 --> 03:53:17.269 align:start position:0%
data thank you
representative

03:53:17.269 --> 03:53:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:17.279 --> 03:53:19.750 align:start position:0%
 
cushman

03:53:19.750 --> 03:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
cushman
 
03:53:21.670 --> 03:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
03:53:23.189 --> 03:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
representative canarque for taking my
 
03:53:23.199 --> 03:53:24.229 align:start position:0%
representative canarque for taking my
question

03:53:24.229 --> 03:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:53:24.239 --> 03:53:25.030 align:start position:0%
question
uh

03:53:25.030 --> 03:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:53:28.150 --> 03:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
you you gave um testimony that the
 
03:53:29.750 --> 03:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine slows the spread in the
 
03:53:31.830 --> 03:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
population even if it
 
03:53:33.510 --> 03:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any effect on transmission
 
03:53:35.750 --> 03:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
between individuals
 
03:53:38.389 --> 03:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
i just want to understand how that
 
03:53:41.269 --> 03:53:41.279 align:start position:0%
how that applies or how that
 
03:53:44.229 --> 03:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
cashes out when you consider that
 
03:53:46.389 --> 03:53:46.399 align:start position:0%
israel the country of israel had some of
 
03:53:48.229 --> 03:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
the highest vaccination rates in the
 
03:53:50.550 --> 03:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
entire world and they not only had
 
03:53:52.630 --> 03:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
higher infection rates among the
 
03:53:54.150 --> 03:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinated but
 
03:53:56.550 --> 03:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
also higher hospitalization and death
 
03:53:59.670 --> 03:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
rates among the vaccinated i presume
 
03:54:01.189 --> 03:54:01.199 align:start position:0%
just for clarification you mean as
 
03:54:02.630 --> 03:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
03:54:04.870 --> 03:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
the unvaccinated
 
03:54:07.110 --> 03:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
is that what you mean yes okay first you
 
03:54:09.030 --> 03:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
have to look at the population
 
03:54:11.189 --> 03:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
so for example we know that covet is a
 
03:54:13.269 --> 03:54:13.279 align:start position:0%
disease that affects a lot of people and
 
03:54:15.030 --> 03:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
it actually has been overall shown in
 
03:54:17.830 --> 03:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
the country to primarily affect
 
03:54:20.070 --> 03:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
it has a disproportionate impact on
 
03:54:21.510 --> 03:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
people of color
 
03:54:23.349 --> 03:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
but wouldn't you be amazed to know that
 
03:54:24.790 --> 03:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
the majority of people who have died of
 
03:54:27.590 --> 03:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
covid in new hampshire are white
 
03:54:28.870 --> 03:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
that's because the majority of people in
 
03:54:31.670 --> 03:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
this country in this state are white
 
03:54:33.750 --> 03:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
so your vaccination rate the higher it
 
03:54:35.990 --> 03:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
goes it means the higher the number of
 
03:54:37.750 --> 03:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
people in your hospital at any given
 
03:54:37.760 --> 03:54:39.990 align:start position:0%
people in your hospital at any given
time

03:54:39.990 --> 03:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:54:41.990 --> 03:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
let's let's take it easy let's say fifty
 
03:54:43.510 --> 03:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
percent and fifty percent you got fifty
 
03:54:44.550 --> 03:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
percent vaccinated fifty percent
 
03:54:44.560 --> 03:54:46.710 align:start position:0%
percent vaccinated fifty percent
unvaccinated

03:54:46.710 --> 03:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated
 
03:54:46.720 --> 03:54:47.590 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated
but

03:54:47.590 --> 03:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:54:49.910 --> 03:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
if you have in like in this state about
 
03:54:51.990 --> 03:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of people vaccinated the pool
 
03:54:53.510 --> 03:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
you're taking from with vaccinated are a
 
03:54:55.110 --> 03:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
heck of a lot higher
 
03:54:57.110 --> 03:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
so that really means that the odds of
 
03:54:58.950 --> 03:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
getting infected are still lower for the
 
03:55:01.110 --> 03:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and the higher the rate of
 
03:55:02.790 --> 03:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
infection sorry the higher the rate of
 
03:55:02.800 --> 03:55:04.469 align:start position:0%
infection sorry the higher the rate of
vaccination

03:55:04.469 --> 03:55:04.479 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
03:55:05.910 --> 03:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
the greater you will see that the
 
03:55:07.830 --> 03:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
population by raw number in your
 
03:55:10.630 --> 03:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
hospital will be the vaccinated
 
03:55:13.110 --> 03:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
even though they are less likely than
 
03:55:14.870 --> 03:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
the unvaccinated to become infected i
 
03:55:16.150 --> 03:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
know that's kind of complicated but it's
 
03:55:18.389 --> 03:55:18.399 align:start position:0%
a matter of the pool it's taken from
 
03:55:20.229 --> 03:55:20.239 align:start position:0%
let's say if you have 100 percent of the
 
03:55:22.950 --> 03:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
people and your stay in your
 
03:55:24.870 --> 03:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
in your state are vaccinated
 
03:55:27.189 --> 03:55:27.199 align:start position:0%
100 of the people admitted will be
 
03:55:27.199 --> 03:55:29.590 align:start position:0%
100 of the people admitted will be
vaccinated

03:55:29.590 --> 03:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
03:55:32.070 --> 03:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
representative cushman on the follow up
 
03:55:34.469 --> 03:55:34.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um thank you
 
03:55:36.070 --> 03:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
representative kanark
 
03:55:38.309 --> 03:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sorry if i wasn't clear in my
 
03:55:41.510 --> 03:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
original question but the rate the rate
 
03:55:44.309 --> 03:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
of infection the rate of hospitalization
 
03:55:47.590 --> 03:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
and the rate of death is higher
 
03:55:51.030 --> 03:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
among vaccinated in israel than among
 
03:55:53.429 --> 03:55:53.439 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated would you believe that
 
03:55:54.870 --> 03:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
i think my concern is knowing do you
 
03:55:56.790 --> 03:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
mean the percent of people for example
 
03:55:58.630 --> 03:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
that's maybe there's 80 of the people in
 
03:56:00.710 --> 03:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
their hospital are vaccinated versus 20
 
03:56:02.070 --> 03:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
is that what you mean by rate i need to
 
03:56:04.550 --> 03:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
know what rate means
 
03:56:05.830 --> 03:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
no the
 
03:56:05.840 --> 03:56:07.910 align:start position:0%
no the
instance

03:56:07.910 --> 03:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
instance
 
03:56:07.920 --> 03:56:09.510 align:start position:0%
instance
of

03:56:09.510 --> 03:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:56:12.550 --> 03:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
infection hospitalization and death
 
03:56:14.710 --> 03:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
the percentage
 
03:56:16.550 --> 03:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
that that happens
 
03:56:20.229 --> 03:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
is higher among the vaccinated in israel
 
03:56:22.070 --> 03:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
right but that's pretty vaccinated per
 
03:56:24.870 --> 03:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
100 000.
 
03:56:24.880 --> 03:56:25.670 align:start position:0%
100 000.
okay

03:56:25.670 --> 03:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:56:27.269 --> 03:56:27.279 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite familiar with that data so
 
03:56:28.950 --> 03:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
it's hard for me to comment i have ac i
 
03:56:30.229 --> 03:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
have looked at the data in this state
 
03:56:32.229 --> 03:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
when for example the comment was made at
 
03:56:33.910 --> 03:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
one point in time that 86 percent of
 
03:56:33.920 --> 03:56:34.710 align:start position:0%
one point in time that 86 percent of
people

03:56:34.710 --> 03:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:56:36.630 --> 03:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
in the hospital at a certain point back
 
03:56:39.269 --> 03:56:39.279 align:start position:0%
in the fall were vaccinated so therefore
 
03:56:40.710 --> 03:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
it wasn't working but the point is that
 
03:56:43.910 --> 03:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
we were 380 were unvaccinated and if you
 
03:56:45.349 --> 03:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
looked at it again you were drawing from
 
03:56:46.389 --> 03:56:46.399 align:start position:0%
a pool
 
03:56:48.870 --> 03:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
of unvaccinated that was far smaller
 
03:56:50.389 --> 03:56:50.399 align:start position:0%
than the pool of vaccinated in this
 
03:56:52.070 --> 03:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
state so it still demonstrated a
 
03:56:53.670 --> 03:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
nine-to-one ratio
 
03:56:54.870 --> 03:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:56:57.910 --> 03:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
chance of being hospitalized by virtue
 
03:57:00.550 --> 03:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
of being unvaccinated um so again i do i
 
03:57:01.830 --> 03:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
have not seen those numbers i'd love to
 
03:57:03.830 --> 03:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
look at them if you'd forward that to me
 
03:57:08.309 --> 03:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:09.750 --> 03:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
03:57:12.150 --> 03:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
03:57:12.160 --> 03:57:13.030 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
um

03:57:13.030 --> 03:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:14.550 --> 03:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
would it be possible for me to ask two
 
03:57:16.630 --> 03:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
one and then a follow-up
 
03:57:18.469 --> 03:57:18.479 align:start position:0%
okay the first question
 
03:57:20.469 --> 03:57:20.479 align:start position:0%
the first question i've been trying to
 
03:57:22.070 --> 03:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
get the information to know how many of
 
03:57:24.150 --> 03:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
the hospitalizations have coveted as an
 
03:57:26.150 --> 03:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
incidental finding because of the
 
03:57:27.910 --> 03:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
testing in order to make sure the right
 
03:57:29.830 --> 03:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
precautions are done so i'm not sure if
 
03:57:31.510 --> 03:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
you're aware in new hampshire what
 
03:57:33.830 --> 03:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
percentage of those hospitalized with
 
03:57:36.469 --> 03:57:36.479 align:start position:0%
covet are hospitalized for covet versus
 
03:57:37.750 --> 03:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
with covet
 
03:57:39.510 --> 03:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
i will have a hard time answering that
 
03:57:40.950 --> 03:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
with precision
 
03:57:42.389 --> 03:57:42.399 align:start position:0%
because we also know there's that under
 
03:57:43.590 --> 03:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
reporting because if you're still
 
03:57:45.110 --> 03:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
hospitalized you're recovering from cove
 
03:57:46.630 --> 03:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
but that's also still not reported and
 
03:57:48.630 --> 03:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
captured after hospital association told
 
03:57:50.950 --> 03:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
us one of the cleaner easier things is
 
03:57:52.790 --> 03:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
to think about is to look when we see
 
03:57:55.269 --> 03:57:55.279 align:start position:0%
the rate who are
 
03:57:55.279 --> 03:57:56.469 align:start position:0%
the rate who are
intubated

03:57:56.469 --> 03:57:56.479 align:start position:0%
intubated
 
03:57:58.710 --> 03:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
in the icu and die and they're not dying
 
03:58:00.950 --> 03:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
because they came in with
 
03:58:02.469 --> 03:58:02.479 align:start position:0%
you know for total hip replacement and
 
03:58:03.910 --> 03:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
incidentally were found to have covered
 
03:58:05.910 --> 03:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
they were dying of coving so
 
03:58:08.389 --> 03:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
yeah follow-up question thank you and my
 
03:58:09.990 --> 03:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up question is i really
 
03:58:12.070 --> 03:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you're looking to that
 
03:58:14.469 --> 03:58:14.479 align:start position:0%
initial seminal study on this that that
 
03:58:17.030 --> 03:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
evaluated in such a large population
 
03:58:19.110 --> 03:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
i wanted to know if you were aware that
 
03:58:21.189 --> 03:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
those in the placebo arm were offered to
 
03:58:23.189 --> 03:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
cross over immediately
 
03:58:24.389 --> 03:58:24.399 align:start position:0%
so that all the people who had
 
03:58:26.309 --> 03:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
volunteered for the study wanted early
 
03:58:28.550 --> 03:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
access to the vaccine so the crossover
 
03:58:30.469 --> 03:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
rate was very large which seriously
 
03:58:32.950 --> 03:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
confounds our long-term assessment of
 
03:58:35.189 --> 03:58:35.199 align:start position:0%
risks i agree 100 but the data that i
 
03:58:36.950 --> 03:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
was quoting was the data from the paper
 
03:58:39.189 --> 03:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
which was prior to them crossing over
 
03:58:40.309 --> 03:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
because you're absolutely right when you
 
03:58:42.229 --> 03:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
cross over the data is no longer good so
 
03:58:44.070 --> 03:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
they're not good for the long-term
 
03:58:46.070 --> 03:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
information but this was the data that
 
03:58:48.469 --> 03:58:48.479 align:start position:0%
was published as the results capturing
 
03:58:50.950 --> 03:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
it i mean it was because of the positive
 
03:58:52.229 --> 03:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
study that then they were allowed to
 
03:58:53.510 --> 03:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
cross over
 
03:58:55.590 --> 03:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh that's kind of routine an awful lot
 
03:58:57.590 --> 03:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
of things we when doing a study you have
 
03:58:58.790 --> 03:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
to have what's called equipoise that
 
03:59:00.950 --> 03:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
means the two different arms have
 
03:59:02.710 --> 03:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
sort of equal probability they might
 
03:59:04.309 --> 03:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
work otherwise it's unethical to do the
 
03:59:04.319 --> 03:59:05.189 align:start position:0%
work otherwise it's unethical to do the
study

03:59:05.189 --> 03:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
study
 
03:59:07.030 --> 03:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes you see that the study is
 
03:59:08.710 --> 03:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
terminated early because it's such a
 
03:59:10.389 --> 03:59:10.399 align:start position:0%
huge difference that it's unethical to
 
03:59:12.950 --> 03:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
consider it back to ethics again and the
 
03:59:15.110 --> 03:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
issue here to continue i should say but
 
03:59:16.870 --> 03:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise you carry it out to completion
 
03:59:18.469 --> 03:59:18.479 align:start position:0%
and after that's done then of course a
 
03:59:19.990 --> 03:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
person may choose
 
03:59:21.750 --> 03:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
to move off into the other treatment
 
03:59:23.030 --> 03:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
group and that is always a potential
 
03:59:24.710 --> 03:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
confounder but they were not moving over
 
03:59:26.389 --> 03:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
prior to that final analysis that's the
 
03:59:29.910 --> 03:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
final analysis prior to moving over
 
03:59:31.670 --> 03:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
one more sorry the last clarifying
 
03:59:31.680 --> 03:59:32.710 align:start position:0%
one more sorry the last clarifying
follow-up

03:59:32.710 --> 03:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:59:34.389 --> 03:59:34.399 align:start position:0%
does that that means that we're not
 
03:59:36.550 --> 03:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at that original
 
03:59:38.710 --> 03:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
trial for any sort of long-term safety
 
03:59:41.110 --> 03:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
or efficacy because the crossover rate
 
03:59:42.550 --> 03:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
was high enough that even if you go
 
03:59:44.950 --> 03:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
intent to treat or actual treatment the
 
03:59:47.189 --> 03:59:47.199 align:start position:0%
data is no longer valid and perhaps
 
03:59:49.590 --> 03:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
theirs might give us a better signal of
 
03:59:51.750 --> 03:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
long-term risk absolutely that that's
 
03:59:53.590 --> 03:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
exactly you're right that's why we do it
 
03:59:55.349 --> 03:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
we do all these studies to
 
03:59:57.189 --> 03:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
identify is something effective and is
 
03:59:58.229 --> 03:59:58.239 align:start position:0%
it safe
 
04:00:00.150 --> 04:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
then it might get in this case emergency
 
04:00:02.710 --> 04:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
approval for that one or later on final
 
04:00:02.720 --> 04:00:03.750 align:start position:0%
approval for that one or later on final
approval

04:00:03.750 --> 04:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
approval
 
04:00:05.269 --> 04:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
then there may be other studies done the
 
04:00:06.950 --> 04:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
second study i discussed was a study
 
04:00:09.030 --> 04:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
done in january well actually completed
 
04:00:10.309 --> 04:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
in january it was done very quickly
 
04:00:12.389 --> 04:00:12.399 align:start position:0%
because of the omicron actually due to
 
04:00:13.910 --> 04:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
the pediatric surge so it's delta and
 
04:00:16.229 --> 04:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
omicron both but the point is
 
04:00:17.670 --> 04:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
that then yes then you have the
 
04:00:19.269 --> 04:00:19.279 align:start position:0%
long-term surveillance post-marketing
 
04:00:22.389 --> 04:00:22.399 align:start position:0%
surveillance is routine in drugs uh but
 
04:00:25.269 --> 04:00:25.279 align:start position:0%
it is very aggressive in terms of covert
 
04:00:27.429 --> 04:00:27.439 align:start position:0%
19 with the vares reporting and the
 
04:00:29.750 --> 04:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporting
 
04:00:31.429 --> 04:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
mandatory for deaths and other adverse
 
04:00:33.510 --> 04:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
severe adverse effects
 
04:00:34.950 --> 04:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
any additional questions for
 
04:00:34.960 --> 04:00:36.630 align:start position:0%
any additional questions for
representative

04:00:36.630 --> 04:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:00:38.790 --> 04:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
representative soloway
 
04:00:40.550 --> 04:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
04:00:42.469 --> 04:00:42.479 align:start position:0%
representative representative would you
 
04:00:42.479 --> 04:00:43.750 align:start position:0%
representative representative would you
believe

04:00:43.750 --> 04:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
believe
 
04:00:45.990 --> 04:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
that in israel there have been three
 
04:00:48.070 --> 04:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
million two hundred eighteen thousand
 
04:00:51.670 --> 04:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
three hundred ninety one cases of covid
 
04:00:54.189 --> 04:00:54.199 align:start position:0%
and only
 
04:00:56.870 --> 04:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
9180 deaths one of the lowest deaths
 
04:00:59.110 --> 04:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
rates reported
 
04:01:00.469 --> 04:01:00.479 align:start position:0%
uh yes i would actually indeed the
 
04:01:02.389 --> 04:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
united states has lagged behind a number
 
04:01:05.110 --> 04:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
of other countries uh in terms of its
 
04:01:06.469 --> 04:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
death rate as you all know we have with
 
04:01:08.790 --> 04:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
the highest when the higher death rates
 
04:01:11.110 --> 04:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
amongst the uh developed countries and
 
04:01:12.389 --> 04:01:12.399 align:start position:0%
part of that is because of our low
 
04:01:14.389 --> 04:01:14.399 align:start position:0%
vaccination rate that is
 
04:01:16.469 --> 04:01:16.479 align:start position:0%
something it is we do have a
 
04:01:17.910 --> 04:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
significantly lower rate than a number
 
04:01:19.990 --> 04:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
of other countries i
 
04:01:21.429 --> 04:01:21.439 align:start position:0%
you know our health care system has
 
04:01:23.189 --> 04:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
other problems as well but
 
04:01:26.070 --> 04:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
that's a major issue
 
04:01:29.349 --> 04:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative canuck as our
 
04:01:31.910 --> 04:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
expert witness in support of the bill
 
04:01:33.590 --> 04:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
now the chair calls
 
04:01:36.070 --> 04:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
an expert witness to testify in
 
04:01:38.630 --> 04:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill dr
 
04:01:45.349 --> 04:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:47.510 --> 04:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for having me
 
04:01:49.269 --> 04:01:49.279 align:start position:0%
um just for the record my name is dr
 
04:01:51.990 --> 04:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
angelina farella i'm a pediatrician in
 
04:01:55.349 --> 04:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
webster texas i have no financial
 
04:01:57.830 --> 04:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
claims or conflicts of interest
 
04:02:00.469 --> 04:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
i was invited invited here by one of
 
04:02:02.469 --> 04:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
your representatives um
 
04:02:05.510 --> 04:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
and uh i really want to on i want you to
 
04:02:07.990 --> 04:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
understand that i've been very outspoken
 
04:02:10.550 --> 04:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
about mandating children for the covid
 
04:02:13.510 --> 04:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine and i hope that my talk will
 
04:02:15.990 --> 04:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
bring up some very salient points i want
 
04:02:17.349 --> 04:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
to first explain to you i've been in
 
04:02:19.670 --> 04:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
practice for 25 years as a pediatrician
 
04:02:21.750 --> 04:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
and prior to 2019
 
04:02:24.790 --> 04:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
my office was pretty much 100 percent
 
04:02:27.750 --> 04:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and in the state of texas
 
04:02:30.229 --> 04:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
we follow acip
 
04:02:32.870 --> 04:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines which in new hampshire
 
04:02:35.670 --> 04:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
you do about half of what we do
 
04:02:35.680 --> 04:02:37.030 align:start position:0%
you do about half of what we do
so

04:02:37.030 --> 04:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:02:38.469 --> 04:02:38.479 align:start position:0%
you know for those of you that think
 
04:02:41.030 --> 04:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
that i might be coming from a side that
 
04:02:43.269 --> 04:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
opposes vaccine you're you're very
 
04:02:43.279 --> 04:02:44.630 align:start position:0%
opposes vaccine you're you're very
mistaken

04:02:44.630 --> 04:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
mistaken
 
04:02:46.150 --> 04:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:02:48.469 --> 04:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
first i want to define what vaccine used
 
04:02:50.870 --> 04:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
to mean and and what it what the
 
04:02:53.189 --> 04:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
definition was that it stimulated
 
04:02:55.990 --> 04:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
your immune system to produce immunity
 
04:02:58.550 --> 04:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
and protect you from a specific disease
 
04:03:01.510 --> 04:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
process and in that process
 
04:03:03.269 --> 04:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
it would prevent the transmission of the
 
04:03:03.279 --> 04:03:04.389 align:start position:0%
it would prevent the transmission of the
disease

04:03:04.389 --> 04:03:04.399 align:start position:0%
disease
 
04:03:06.309 --> 04:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
why did the definition then change in
 
04:03:08.710 --> 04:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
september 2nd of 2021
 
04:03:08.720 --> 04:03:09.590 align:start position:0%
september 2nd of 2021
to

04:03:09.590 --> 04:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:03:11.830 --> 04:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
a preparation used to stimulate the
 
04:03:14.469 --> 04:03:14.479 align:start position:0%
body's immune response
 
04:03:17.030 --> 04:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
as you notice they stopped talking about
 
04:03:19.349 --> 04:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
producing immunity
 
04:03:20.950 --> 04:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
the history of vaccine development
 
04:03:22.630 --> 04:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
usually takes five to ten years
 
04:03:24.389 --> 04:03:24.399 align:start position:0%
especially in children
 
04:03:25.990 --> 04:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
the development starts with animal
 
04:03:29.030 --> 04:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
studies and then extensive safety phase
 
04:03:32.309 --> 04:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
trials go into phase 2 and phase 3
 
04:03:35.110 --> 04:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
before any kind of approval can happen
 
04:03:38.389 --> 04:03:38.399 align:start position:0%
the coven 19 vaccine skipped animal
 
04:03:38.399 --> 04:03:39.830 align:start position:0%
the coven 19 vaccine skipped animal
trials

04:03:39.830 --> 04:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
trials
 
04:03:41.990 --> 04:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
it combined phase two and three and
 
04:03:44.070 --> 04:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
unblinded their study prematurely so now
 
04:03:45.429 --> 04:03:45.439 align:start position:0%
the control
 
04:03:49.670 --> 04:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
group is moved over into a treatment arm
 
04:03:52.309 --> 04:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
the demographics were skewed to younger
 
04:03:55.670 --> 04:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
and healthier populations and excluded
 
04:03:58.710 --> 04:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
please pay attention pregnant
 
04:04:01.110 --> 04:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
and breastfeeding moms
 
04:04:03.510 --> 04:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
those with autoimmune disease
 
04:04:05.590 --> 04:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
those that were previously infected with
 
04:04:05.600 --> 04:04:06.630 align:start position:0%
those that were previously infected with
covid

04:04:06.630 --> 04:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
covid
 
04:04:08.870 --> 04:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
those with bleeding disorders
 
04:04:10.550 --> 04:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
it lacked good standards for testing
 
04:04:12.950 --> 04:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
subjects for suspected disease
 
04:04:14.790 --> 04:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
the outcomes in the first two months of
 
04:04:16.790 --> 04:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
this trial were ignored there were
 
04:04:19.429 --> 04:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
actually 20 deaths in the inoculated
 
04:04:22.870 --> 04:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
group and 14 in the placebo group
 
04:04:25.070 --> 04:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
of those 20 deaths 14 were
 
04:04:27.910 --> 04:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular events
 
04:04:30.070 --> 04:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
the adverse events that were also
 
04:04:32.870 --> 04:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
reported in these first two months
 
04:04:32.880 --> 04:04:34.469 align:start position:0%
reported in these first two months
were

04:04:34.469 --> 04:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:04:36.870 --> 04:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
they they broke them down into related
 
04:04:39.590 --> 04:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
severe and serious the related adverse
 
04:04:42.950 --> 04:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
events numbered 5241
 
04:04:45.750 --> 04:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
in the inoculated group in the placebo
 
04:04:48.550 --> 04:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
group it was 1311
 
04:04:52.389 --> 04:04:52.399 align:start position:0%
which showed a 300 percent increase in
 
04:04:55.429 --> 04:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
serious related adverse events in the
 
04:04:58.550 --> 04:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
inoculated group 300
 
04:05:01.830 --> 04:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
severe 362
 
04:05:05.110 --> 04:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
events in the inoculated group 150
 
04:05:06.950 --> 04:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
in the placebo group which is an
 
04:05:09.750 --> 04:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
increase of over 75 percent
 
04:05:11.750 --> 04:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
serious adverse events which include
 
04:05:15.670 --> 04:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations and er visits were 127
 
04:05:19.429 --> 04:05:19.439 align:start position:0%
in the inoculated group and 116 in the
 
04:05:21.750 --> 04:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
placebo group which was up an additional
 
04:05:23.030 --> 04:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
10 percent
 
04:05:25.670 --> 04:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
but the outcome was not for death or
 
04:05:28.070 --> 04:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
hospitalization with the pfizer trial it
 
04:05:29.670 --> 04:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
was for cases
 
04:05:29.680 --> 04:05:30.389 align:start position:0%
was for cases
so

04:05:30.389 --> 04:05:30.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:05:32.550 --> 04:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
if you look at the case rate it was
 
04:05:36.469 --> 04:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
eight per 18 198
 
04:05:39.189 --> 04:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
subjects in the inoculated group for a
 
04:05:40.990 --> 04:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
percentage of
 
04:05:41.000 --> 04:05:42.830 align:start position:0%
percentage of
0.04

04:05:42.830 --> 04:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
0.04
 
04:05:46.070 --> 04:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
percent versus in the placebo group
 
04:05:47.990 --> 04:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
there was 162
 
04:05:48.000 --> 04:05:49.110 align:start position:0%
there was 162
cases

04:05:49.110 --> 04:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
cases
 
04:05:52.750 --> 04:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
over 18 325 which gives you a
 
04:05:55.670 --> 04:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
0.88 percent
 
04:05:57.269 --> 04:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
case outcome
 
04:05:59.349 --> 04:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
still less than one percent
 
04:06:01.110 --> 04:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
still less than one percent
 
04:06:04.309 --> 04:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
post-marketing pharmaco villages report
 
04:06:06.710 --> 04:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
which reported two and a half months two
 
04:06:08.870 --> 04:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
and a half months after the emergency
 
04:06:10.630 --> 04:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
use authorization
 
04:06:13.590 --> 04:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
this was done in november 17th of 2021
 
04:06:16.790 --> 04:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
there was in excess already of 1200
 
04:06:16.800 --> 04:06:19.030 align:start position:0%
there was in excess already of 1200
deaths

04:06:19.030 --> 04:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
04:06:21.830 --> 04:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
more than 25 000 nervous system adverse
 
04:06:23.910 --> 04:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
events and there were concerns for
 
04:06:27.110 --> 04:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
anaphylaxis and vaccine-associated
 
04:06:29.189 --> 04:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
enhanced disease
 
04:06:31.110 --> 04:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
this is not just a red flag people this
 
04:06:33.830 --> 04:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
is a signal what we call in in medicine
 
04:06:35.670 --> 04:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
a signal
 
04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
july 27th of 21 the cdc actually
 
04:06:41.910 --> 04:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
admitted that covid19 vaccines do not
 
04:06:44.309 --> 04:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
provide immunity or prevent people from
 
04:06:45.910 --> 04:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
catching the disease that's out of their
 
04:06:48.309 --> 04:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
own mouths
 
04:06:48.319 --> 04:06:49.110 align:start position:0%
own mouths
all

04:06:49.110 --> 04:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:06:51.030 --> 04:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
in in children this is all risk and no
 
04:06:54.309 --> 04:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
benefit the age group between 12 to 15
 
04:06:56.630 --> 04:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
that study was underpowered there was
 
04:06:59.590 --> 04:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
only a thousand kids in the inoculation
 
04:07:03.750 --> 04:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
group versus 978 in the placebo group
 
04:07:06.150 --> 04:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
statistically children are not at any
 
04:07:08.469 --> 04:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
risk for death for covid19 but they're
 
04:07:10.870 --> 04:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
at high risk for adverse events
 
04:07:14.389 --> 04:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
in the age group of five to 11 the cdc
 
04:07:16.790 --> 04:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that i'm sorry pfizer
 
04:07:19.110 --> 04:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that their that myocardius
 
04:07:22.870 --> 04:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
myocardius might happen
 
04:07:26.229 --> 04:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
might happen in healthy subjects
 
04:07:28.710 --> 04:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
myocarditis is an inflammation of the
 
04:07:30.870 --> 04:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
heart where the muscle
 
04:07:32.790 --> 04:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
is so inflamed that blood may not be
 
04:07:34.550 --> 04:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
adequately delivered to the rest of your
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
body and this can lead to stroke or
 
04:07:39.349 --> 04:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
heart attack the mortality rate is up to
 
04:07:42.710 --> 04:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
20 percent at six and a half years post

event
 
04:07:47.269 --> 04:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
we have to prove these things safe first
 
04:07:49.429 --> 04:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
before we give them to kids kids are not
 
04:07:50.950 --> 04:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
little adults
 
04:07:52.710 --> 04:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
lots of stats that were thrown out here
 
04:07:54.550 --> 04:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
are on adults
 
04:07:56.550 --> 04:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
dr eric rubin who is the new england

journal of medicine editor-in-chief who
 
04:08:01.429 --> 04:08:01.439 align:start position:0%
published the pfizer study
 
04:08:03.349 --> 04:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
stated in the
 
04:08:04.389 --> 04:08:04.399 align:start position:0%
trials that
 
04:08:06.309 --> 04:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
it's okay to start giving it to find out
 
04:08:09.750 --> 04:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
the adverse events just like rotavirus
 
04:08:11.189 --> 04:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
let me explain to you in rotavirus
 
04:08:13.189 --> 04:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
fibrovirus um
 
04:08:15.750 --> 04:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
is a another viral disease that causes
 
04:08:17.750 --> 04:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
high risk of hospitalization death in
 
04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
small children
 
04:08:21.349 --> 04:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
the rota shield was pulled off the
 
04:08:24.070 --> 04:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
market after 59 cases of intussusception
 
04:08:26.229 --> 04:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
which is a telescoping of the gut i was
 
04:08:28.469 --> 04:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
a pediatrician at that time i worked in
 
04:08:30.550 --> 04:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
the hospital and it was my job to walk
 
04:08:33.269 --> 04:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
around to all those refrigerators and
 
04:08:36.309 --> 04:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
pull the rotor shield out of the
 
04:08:41.030 --> 04:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
refrigerators 59 cases of a non-deadly
 
04:08:41.040 --> 04:08:43.990 align:start position:0%

process

04:08:43.990 --> 04:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:46.630 --> 04:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
it took them five years to get another
 
04:08:49.030 --> 04:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
rotavirus vaccine back on the market
 
04:08:50.309 --> 04:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
five years
 
04:08:51.830 --> 04:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
and this was a fully
 
04:08:55.510 --> 04:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
approved fda vaccine
 
04:08:58.870 --> 04:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
the swine flu back in 1976
 
04:09:01.189 --> 04:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
this was when uh president gerald ford
 
04:09:02.710 --> 04:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
thought that it would be a good idea to
 
04:09:05.189 --> 04:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
hurry up and get a swine flu vaccine out
 
04:09:09.990 --> 04:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
there it was pulled after 25 deaths
 
04:09:13.349 --> 04:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
pulled off the market 25 deaths
 
04:09:15.429 --> 04:09:15.439 align:start position:0%
they also noted there was 500 cases of
 
04:09:16.790 --> 04:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
gillian barr syndrome which is a
 
04:09:16.800 --> 04:09:18.149 align:start position:0%
gillian barr syndrome which is a
paralytic

04:09:18.149 --> 04:09:18.159 align:start position:0%

okay

04:09:27.030 --> 04:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:09:30.309 --> 04:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
all cases in all years of myocarditis
 
04:09:31.830 --> 04:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to run these through real
 
04:09:33.990 --> 04:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
fast so that you know with the covid 19

04:10:16.870 --> 04:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
1774 kids that received the covid
 
04:10:20.070 --> 04:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine now have myocarditis that is a
 
04:10:21.750 --> 04:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
lifelong condition will shorten their
 
04:10:23.910 --> 04:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
lives and now they have to see a
 
04:10:23.920 --> 04:10:25.269 align:start position:0%
lives and now they have to see a
cardiologist

04:10:25.269 --> 04:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
cardiologist
 
04:10:27.750 --> 04:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
every year or more frequently for

every year or more frequently for
follow-up

04:10:29.429 --> 04:10:29.439 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:10:31.429 --> 04:10:31.439 align:start position:0%
at the same time we had
 
04:10:33.910 --> 04:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
three precious five to eleven-year-olds
 
04:10:37.630 --> 04:10:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:40.950 --> 04:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
399 kids ages 12
 
04:10:43.030 --> 04:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
and young adults through 29 they skewed
 
04:10:46.630 --> 04:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
the results 399 heart attacks dead this
 
04:10:48.229 --> 04:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
is not normal children do not die of
 
04:10:50.309 --> 04:10:50.319 align:start position:0%
heart attacks
 
04:10:51.990 --> 04:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire since we're in new
 
04:10:53.429 --> 04:10:53.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire i want to tell you about your
 
04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine-reported adverse events in age
 
04:11:02.630 --> 04:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:05.830 --> 04:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
sorry in age groups 12 to 18 you have
 
04:11:08.309 --> 04:11:08.319 align:start position:0%
two deaths reported
 
04:11:10.070 --> 04:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
secondary to the coveted vaccine
 
04:11:13.750 --> 04:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
administration out of 167 reports
 
04:11:17.110 --> 04:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
you have seven cases of myocarditis
 
04:11:19.990 --> 04:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
13 hospitalizations and one permanently
 
04:11:22.389 --> 04:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
disabled child
 
04:11:25.189 --> 04:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
for kids this is all risk and no benefit
 
04:11:29.670 --> 04:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
even the aap says that 0.1 to 1.5
 
04:11:31.750 --> 04:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
percent of co-hospitalization is in
 
04:11:31.760 --> 04:11:32.710 align:start position:0%
percent of co-hospitalization is in
children

04:11:32.710 --> 04:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:11:39.670 --> 04:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:41.510 --> 04:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
is a death from kovid
 
04:11:43.990 --> 04:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
four states in our nation have reported
 
04:11:46.830 --> 04:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
no deaths and as of january of
 
04:11:50.389 --> 04:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
2022 new hampshire was one of those
 
04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
so in new hampshire you've lost 2 223
 
04:11:54.239 --> 04:11:55.830 align:start position:0%
so in new hampshire you've lost 2 223
citizens

04:11:55.830 --> 04:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
04:11:58.630 --> 04:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
and this is a tragedy
 
04:12:02.070 --> 04:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
in the 0-17 age group again this is from
 
04:12:03.750 --> 04:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
the beginning of february
 
04:12:05.910 --> 04:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
there were none from covid
 
04:12:08.309 --> 04:12:08.319 align:start position:0%
you had 183
 
04:12:11.910 --> 04:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
deaths of children from 0-17 for all
 
04:12:11.920 --> 04:12:13.269 align:start position:0%
deaths of children from 0-17 for all
causes

04:12:13.269 --> 04:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
causes
 
04:12:16.070 --> 04:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
in the united states by contrast 0-17 we
 
04:12:18.229 --> 04:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
had 770 children
 
04:12:21.030 --> 04:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
die from covid or with covid
 
04:12:22.229 --> 04:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
out of
 
04:12:22.239 --> 04:12:23.710 align:start position:0%
out of

463 kids that died of all other causes
 
04:12:31.590 --> 04:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
covet association is one point one
 
04:12:34.710 --> 04:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
percent of all possible pediatric
 
04:12:38.550 --> 04:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:40.870 --> 04:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
the first tenant of medicine is do no
 
04:12:40.880 --> 04:12:42.229 align:start position:0%
the first tenant of medicine is do no

04:12:42.229 --> 04:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
harm
 
04:12:44.950 --> 04:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
first tenant the coven vaccine
 
04:12:47.110 --> 04:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
is for the alpha variant and now we're
 
04:12:49.750 --> 04:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
down the frat row of variance and there
 
04:12:52.950 --> 04:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
it does not stop the spread of coven 19.
 
04:12:55.750 --> 04:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
natural immunity is strong and durable
 
04:12:58.550 --> 04:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
as the johns hopkins study just showed
 
04:13:00.469 --> 04:13:00.479 align:start position:0%
21 months
 
04:13:01.830 --> 04:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
just came out
 
04:13:04.710 --> 04:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
we know that from the sars co v1 there's

04:13:14.630 --> 04:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
available and it works
 
04:13:18.149 --> 04:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
there's a tenant of causality as well
 
04:13:19.990 --> 04:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
for epidemiology
 
04:13:22.790 --> 04:13:22.800 align:start position:0%

unequivocally

show that these vaccines are causing
 
04:13:28.870 --> 04:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
larger numbers of deaths than would be
 
04:13:28.880 --> 04:13:30.309 align:start position:0%

04:13:54.710 --> 04:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:13:56.229 --> 04:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:13:57.830 --> 04:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
are you familiar
 
04:13:59.910 --> 04:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
with the um
 
04:14:03.349 --> 04:14:03.359 align:start position:0%
the issues with vares as far as how
 
04:14:05.830 --> 04:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
often adverse reactions are actually
 
04:14:07.910 --> 04:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
reported we know that it's required by
 
04:14:09.189 --> 04:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
the law
 
04:14:11.349 --> 04:14:11.359 align:start position:0%
i've been a nurse for seven years and
 
04:14:13.269 --> 04:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
i've encountered patients with vaccine
 
04:14:14.870 --> 04:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
injury and i've personally filled out
 
04:14:17.349 --> 04:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
vare's reports but i can tell you every
 
04:14:19.349 --> 04:14:19.359 align:start position:0%
nurse i've ever asked if they've ever
 
04:14:20.950 --> 04:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
done it didn't even know that the system
 
04:14:23.110 --> 04:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
existed and
 
04:14:25.269 --> 04:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with the harvard study
 
04:14:27.349 --> 04:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
it was harvard pilgrim in 2010 where
 
04:14:29.670 --> 04:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
they found it was conducted in
 
04:14:31.510 --> 04:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the health resources
 
04:14:33.750 --> 04:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
services administration
 
04:14:35.990 --> 04:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
found that it was estimated that only
 
04:14:38.389 --> 04:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
one percent of all injuries are actually
 
04:14:40.550 --> 04:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
ever reported to vares that's absolutely
 
04:14:42.710 --> 04:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
true yeah that was a hopkins study um
 
04:14:44.710 --> 04:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
that showed that the reporting system is
 
04:14:45.910 --> 04:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
very um
 
04:14:45.920 --> 04:14:47.510 align:start position:0%
very um
arduous

04:14:47.510 --> 04:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
arduous
 
04:14:49.990 --> 04:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
although 70 percent of what is reported
 
04:14:51.269 --> 04:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
on bears
 
04:14:54.550 --> 04:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
is is from either a medical professional
 
04:14:57.269 --> 04:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
or from the actual company itself
 
04:14:59.110 --> 04:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
over 70 percent
 
04:15:01.830 --> 04:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
so you have to understand that although
 
04:15:02.830 --> 04:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
04:15:04.950 --> 04:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
perfect it's not even close to being
 
04:15:04.960 --> 04:15:06.070 align:start position:0%
perfect it's not even close to being
perfect

04:15:06.070 --> 04:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
04:15:08.309 --> 04:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
because we're missing 99 of adverse
 
04:15:10.389 --> 04:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
events as a pediatrician i'm well aware
 
04:15:12.950 --> 04:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
of what bears is i could say in the in
 
04:15:16.229 --> 04:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
prior to 2019 i've never had to make
 
04:15:16.239 --> 04:15:17.670 align:start position:0%
prior to 2019 i've never had to make
any

04:15:17.670 --> 04:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:15:17.680 --> 04:15:18.790 align:start position:0%
any
any

04:15:18.790 --> 04:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:15:20.790 --> 04:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
reports to theirs and i'm very happy to
 
04:15:23.030 --> 04:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
say that considering i have nearly a
 
04:15:25.269 --> 04:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
hundred percent vaccination rate of a
 
04:15:27.990 --> 04:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
vaccination schedule that's double
 
04:15:28.000 --> 04:15:29.750 align:start position:0%
vaccination schedule that's double
yours

04:15:29.750 --> 04:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
yours
 
04:15:31.670 --> 04:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
and it's because i asked the pertinent
 
04:15:33.349 --> 04:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
proper questions
 
04:15:35.269 --> 04:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
and i have informed consent to my
 
04:15:36.870 --> 04:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
patient population
 
04:15:39.110 --> 04:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
which is not happening with the covet 19
 
04:15:41.670 --> 04:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine either so
 
04:15:44.389 --> 04:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
one percent is being reported and yes
 
04:15:47.189 --> 04:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
it's a poor system but it's the best we
 
04:15:49.030 --> 04:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
have right now and i can tell you it
 
04:15:52.070 --> 04:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
takes over 20 minutes to try to report
 
04:15:54.469 --> 04:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
one adverse event and just in my
 
04:15:56.309 --> 04:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
personal private practice which is very
 
04:15:58.469 --> 04:15:58.479 align:start position:0%
small i'm a solo practitioner i don't
 
04:16:00.389 --> 04:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
come from a big university
 
04:16:03.269 --> 04:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
um uh you know i'm independent and i
 
04:16:04.790 --> 04:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
have seven
 
04:16:07.030 --> 04:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
teenagers right now that i am trying to
 
04:16:09.349 --> 04:16:09.359 align:start position:0%
treat for post-vaccination
 
04:16:12.469 --> 04:16:12.479 align:start position:0%
problems that never had any problems
 
04:16:14.149 --> 04:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
prior these were my patients since the
 
04:16:15.910 --> 04:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
time they were babies
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
they went out on their own thinking they
 
04:16:18.870 --> 04:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
were doing something for the greater
 
04:16:18.880 --> 04:16:19.750 align:start position:0%
were doing something for the greater
good

04:16:19.750 --> 04:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:16:21.750 --> 04:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
got themselves a shot
 
04:16:23.429 --> 04:16:23.439 align:start position:0%
and now we're suffering
 
04:16:25.429 --> 04:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
and no one can help them
 
04:16:27.750 --> 04:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
and the sad thing is is that's what i'm
 
04:16:28.950 --> 04:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
trying to do
 
04:16:31.189 --> 04:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
even though we have no precedence
 
04:16:32.790 --> 04:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
we're flying by the seat of our pants
 
04:16:34.229 --> 04:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
here in medicine
 
04:16:36.389 --> 04:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately we've monetized
 
04:16:39.590 --> 04:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
medicine and that's a bigger problem
 
04:16:39.600 --> 04:16:40.630 align:start position:0%
medicine and that's a bigger problem
doctor

04:16:40.630 --> 04:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
04:16:43.110 --> 04:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
do i hear you when you say they went out
 
04:16:45.750 --> 04:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
on their own these teenagers who on
 
04:16:47.269 --> 04:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
their own
 
04:16:50.630 --> 04:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
chose to get vaccinated without their
 
04:16:53.429 --> 04:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
parents knowledge or permission so two
 
04:16:56.710 --> 04:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
of the two of the no three of the seven
 
04:16:58.950 --> 04:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
were under 18 and their parents were
 
04:17:00.149 --> 04:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
with them
 
04:17:02.550 --> 04:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
um so their parents were with them when
 
04:17:03.750 --> 04:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
they got it
 
04:17:06.950 --> 04:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
four of which i also treat kids up to 26
 
04:17:08.309 --> 04:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
in my practice
 
04:17:08.319 --> 04:17:09.110 align:start position:0%
in my practice
so

04:17:09.110 --> 04:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:17:11.910 --> 04:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
um four the other ones were over 18 okay
 
04:17:14.870 --> 04:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
so there were 18 19 young adults um and
 
04:17:17.670 --> 04:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
they went on their own to do it one was
 
04:17:19.110 --> 04:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
actually an emancipated minor she's
 
04:17:21.670 --> 04:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
married okay a question from
 
04:17:23.990 --> 04:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative king
 
04:17:25.990 --> 04:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
doctor for taking my question
 
04:17:28.560 --> 04:17:29.910 align:start position:0%
doctor for taking my question
um

04:17:29.910 --> 04:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:31.590 --> 04:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sure there's a joke in here about an
 
04:17:33.510 --> 04:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
engineer trying to be a doctor
 
04:17:36.229 --> 04:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
um but i'm not gonna go there um
 
04:17:36.239 --> 04:17:37.429 align:start position:0%
um but i'm not gonna go there um
anyway

04:17:37.429 --> 04:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
04:17:40.229 --> 04:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
uh dr kinnerk referred to a young man
 
04:17:44.149 --> 04:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
who died swimming and uh he had a
 
04:17:44.159 --> 04:17:45.429 align:start position:0%
who died swimming and uh he had a
thicker

04:17:45.429 --> 04:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
thicker
 
04:17:46.950 --> 04:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh ventricle
 
04:17:46.960 --> 04:17:48.389 align:start position:0%
uh ventricle
um

04:17:48.389 --> 04:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:51.510 --> 04:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
and then as you explained
 
04:17:51.520 --> 04:17:52.950 align:start position:0%
and then as you explained
could myocarditis

04:17:52.950 --> 04:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
could myocarditis
 
04:17:55.349 --> 04:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
can the two of those be linked somehow
 
04:17:55.359 --> 04:17:56.630 align:start position:0%
can the two of those be linked somehow
yes

04:17:56.630 --> 04:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:17:58.630 --> 04:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
so it's an inflammation of the heart
 
04:18:00.309 --> 04:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
whether it's a part of the heart or the
 
04:18:01.830 --> 04:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
whole heart it's still an inflammation
 
04:18:04.070 --> 04:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
part of the heart and since we don't
 
04:18:07.030 --> 04:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
know what his pre pre-status was
 
04:18:08.469 --> 04:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
it's very possible that he had an
 
04:18:11.030 --> 04:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
enlarged heart although in teenagers
 
04:18:13.830 --> 04:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
especially those that have hit puberty
 
04:18:15.269 --> 04:18:15.279 align:start position:0%
children are very different so
 
04:18:17.030 --> 04:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
pre-pubertal those kids will stop when
 
04:18:19.510 --> 04:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
they're tired once they hit puberty
 
04:18:21.189 --> 04:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
athletes will push themselves to an
 
04:18:22.550 --> 04:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
extent that is just beyond
 
04:18:24.870 --> 04:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
ridiculousness and we if anyone that has
 
04:18:26.790 --> 04:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
a teenager understands what i'm saying
 
04:18:26.800 --> 04:18:27.590 align:start position:0%
a teenager understands what i'm saying
so

04:18:27.590 --> 04:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:18:30.950 --> 04:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
these kids will maximize their heart to
 
04:18:33.030 --> 04:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
such an extent that you know if it was
 
04:18:35.510 --> 04:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
an adult we'd kill right over
 
04:18:38.229 --> 04:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
these children are in excellent health
 
04:18:39.429 --> 04:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
i mean you think about it they don't
 
04:18:40.630 --> 04:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
have diabetes yet they don't have
 
04:18:43.110 --> 04:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
hypertension yet there is absolutely no
 
04:18:44.790 --> 04:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
reason why a kid should drop dead from a
 
04:18:46.790 --> 04:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
heart attack especially in the age of
 
04:18:48.790 --> 04:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
five to 11.
 
04:18:50.389 --> 04:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:18:52.710 --> 04:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
04:18:52.720 --> 04:18:53.910 align:start position:0%

acton
 
04:18:55.750 --> 04:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i thank you
 
04:18:55.760 --> 04:18:58.550 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i thank you
doctor

04:18:58.550 --> 04:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:01.030 --> 04:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
as a father of a
 
04:19:02.950 --> 04:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
10 year old daughter
 
04:19:04.070 --> 04:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
i am
 
04:19:06.469 --> 04:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
filled with vaccine hesitancy
 
04:19:08.389 --> 04:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
due to the problem of of
 
04:19:10.149 --> 04:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
getting real data
 
04:19:10.159 --> 04:19:11.830 align:start position:0%
getting real data
um

04:19:11.830 --> 04:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:13.750 --> 04:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of my sources have been censored
 
04:19:16.870 --> 04:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:19.510 --> 04:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm very much worried about
 
04:19:22.149 --> 04:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
what how this vaccine will affect
 
04:19:24.229 --> 04:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
fertility for the future do you have any
 
04:19:25.830 --> 04:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
information that you could
 
04:19:28.950 --> 04:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
give us on that yes sir actually i do in
 
04:19:31.030 --> 04:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
the japanese study japanese
 
04:19:32.870 --> 04:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
before allowing pfizer to come into
 
04:19:34.710 --> 04:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
their country which is why they're only
 
04:19:36.790 --> 04:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
18 vaccinated
 
04:19:39.349 --> 04:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
they they wanted studies from the
 
04:19:41.910 --> 04:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
company to show distribution and the
 
04:19:45.510 --> 04:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
distribution oddly enough is highest in
 
04:19:48.550 --> 04:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
women's ovaries and in men's testes
 
04:19:50.309 --> 04:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
we do not know what that means for the
 
04:19:52.950 --> 04:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
future except that it's the distribution
 
04:19:55.349 --> 04:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
of the spike protein which we know
 
04:19:57.110 --> 04:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
is the problem
 
04:20:00.149 --> 04:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
with covid it's the spike protein why
 
04:20:02.309 --> 04:20:02.319 align:start position:0%
would the spike protein need to deposit
 
04:20:04.870 --> 04:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
in an ovary that just doesn't make any
 
04:20:07.110 --> 04:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
sense you know a vaccine's supposed to
 
04:20:09.910 --> 04:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
stay in the spot that you inject it
 
04:20:11.429 --> 04:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
just so that people know in case you
 
04:20:12.389 --> 04:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
don't understand
 
04:20:13.990 --> 04:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
and your body is supposed to develop
 
04:20:15.590 --> 04:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
stuff where you inject it so if that's
 
04:20:17.990 --> 04:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
in your leg or in your arm wherever that
 
04:20:18.950 --> 04:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
might be
 
04:20:21.910 --> 04:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
um and what they noticed in the
 
04:20:24.389 --> 04:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
what the japanese had uh said to pfizer
 
04:20:25.750 --> 04:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
is we need to see your distribution
 
04:20:28.710 --> 04:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
studies oddly enough they did not show
 
04:20:30.950 --> 04:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
the distribution to the brain and we
 
04:20:33.189 --> 04:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
know we know for a fact because it's
 
04:20:35.510 --> 04:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
causing neurologic problems that it must
 
04:20:38.389 --> 04:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
pass the blood-brain barrier
 
04:20:41.110 --> 04:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
it must pass it what we're seeing in the
 
04:20:42.950 --> 04:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
neurologic realm is absolutely
 
04:20:42.960 --> 04:20:44.469 align:start position:0%
neurologic realm is absolutely
terrifying

04:20:44.469 --> 04:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
terrifying
 
04:20:47.830 --> 04:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:49.990 --> 04:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
and this is this is more anecdotal i
 
04:20:51.910 --> 04:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
mean we know that in their study they
 
04:20:55.750 --> 04:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
have 25 000 but i've personally seen one
 
04:20:58.550 --> 04:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
patient 15 years old five hours after
 
04:21:00.950 --> 04:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
getting that vaccine contour in ways
 
04:21:02.870 --> 04:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
i've never seen anyone do before in my
 
04:21:02.880 --> 04:21:04.790 align:start position:0%
i've never seen anyone do before in my
life

04:21:04.790 --> 04:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
life
 
04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
and we also know that one of their
 
04:21:08.550 --> 04:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
pfizer study patients
 
04:21:10.790 --> 04:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
now is permanently disabled
 
04:21:12.950 --> 04:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
with irretractable seizures
 
04:21:15.750 --> 04:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
has to be fed with an ng tube this was a
 
04:21:15.760 --> 04:21:16.870 align:start position:0%
has to be fed with an ng tube this was a
perfectly

04:21:16.870 --> 04:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
perfectly
 
04:21:20.469 --> 04:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
fine 12 year old whose mom
 
04:21:22.309 --> 04:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
sat down through the informed consent
 
04:21:24.550 --> 04:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
and thought this is a great idea let's
 
04:21:26.229 --> 04:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
let's you know my child's going to be a
 
04:21:26.239 --> 04:21:28.389 align:start position:0%
let's you know my child's going to be a
subject

04:21:28.389 --> 04:21:28.399 align:start position:0%
subject
 
04:21:29.510 --> 04:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
and now
 
04:21:31.750 --> 04:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
pfizer won't answer her calls
 
04:21:33.750 --> 04:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
there's absolutely no repercussion no
 
04:21:35.670 --> 04:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
one is helping this poor woman with her
 
04:21:37.670 --> 04:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
12 year old daughter who is permanently
 
04:21:40.469 --> 04:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
disabled this is seen with senator
 
04:21:42.710 --> 04:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
johnson's senate trials
 
04:21:43.830 --> 04:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that you have to
 
04:21:45.110 --> 04:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
understand as well because you're
 
04:21:46.870 --> 04:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
talking to a censored physician right
 
04:21:46.880 --> 04:21:48.229 align:start position:0%
talking to a censored physician right
here

04:21:48.229 --> 04:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:21:48.239 --> 04:21:49.189 align:start position:0%
here
um

04:21:49.189 --> 04:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:50.790 --> 04:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
is you're right there's there's a
 
04:21:54.229 --> 04:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
there's a lack of professional
 
04:21:56.790 --> 04:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
banter intellectual banter
 
04:21:59.590 --> 04:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
you know we we never called the cdc or
 
04:22:01.269 --> 04:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
nih and asked them how to treat our
 
04:22:03.670 --> 04:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
patient ever
 
04:22:06.149 --> 04:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
i did i did a rabbit hole study
 
04:22:09.189 --> 04:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
in february of 2020 because i wanted to
 
04:22:10.870 --> 04:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that if one of my patients
 
04:22:12.469 --> 04:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
walked in the door
 
04:22:12.479 --> 04:22:13.269 align:start position:0%
walked in the door
with

04:22:13.269 --> 04:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:22:15.269 --> 04:22:15.279 align:start position:0%
this disease that i knew how to treat
 
04:22:15.279 --> 04:22:16.229 align:start position:0%
this disease that i knew how to treat
them

04:22:16.229 --> 04:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:22:18.790 --> 04:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
and i thought oh respiratory check got
 
04:22:21.030 --> 04:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
that one i know how to use a nebulizer
 
04:22:22.469 --> 04:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
albuterol and buds and i didn't give
 
04:22:23.990 --> 04:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
oral steroids and maybe some
 
04:22:26.389 --> 04:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
azithromycin if necessary how about an
 
04:22:29.189 --> 04:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
antiviral we have tamiflu amantadine we
 
04:22:31.590 --> 04:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
have oflusa we have a ton of stuff to
 
04:22:33.590 --> 04:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
use and now we can't use it they say
 
04:22:36.309 --> 04:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
there's no treatment
 
04:22:38.630 --> 04:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's a censorship issue
 
04:22:39.990 --> 04:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
04:22:43.110 --> 04:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
other questions representative leon
 
04:22:44.790 --> 04:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:22:46.870 --> 04:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
being here and taking these questions i
 
04:22:48.389 --> 04:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
know we heard before about the sudden
 
04:22:51.189 --> 04:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
cardiac death in young men and and boys
 
04:22:52.710 --> 04:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
that it's a real issue and that's when
 
04:22:54.389 --> 04:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
we've we've changed how we do things
 
04:22:56.070 --> 04:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
because we have these physicals to
 
04:22:58.710 --> 04:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
prevent it i'm curious if these heart
 
04:23:01.189 --> 04:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
attacks were similar to that if it might
 
04:23:03.349 --> 04:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
be exacerbating an underlying condition
 
04:23:05.349 --> 04:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
or if this is an entirely different
 
04:23:07.110 --> 04:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
mechanism of heart attack because i know
 
04:23:09.189 --> 04:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
there's lots of different kinds of ways
 
04:23:11.269 --> 04:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
to die because of your heart right so if
 
04:23:14.710 --> 04:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
you actually look at the pre covered 19
 
04:23:16.550 --> 04:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine numbers and the posts look in
 
04:23:18.389 --> 04:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
the professional sports
 
04:23:22.389 --> 04:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
um that overall they lost maybe four
 
04:23:24.309 --> 04:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
people per year
 
04:23:26.389 --> 04:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
on the on the soccer fields or
 
04:23:28.870 --> 04:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
professional sports okay four in the
 
04:23:30.550 --> 04:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
whole world
 
04:23:33.750 --> 04:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
we're up to over 24 now
 
04:23:36.070 --> 04:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
that's a real short time and what's
 
04:23:39.030 --> 04:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
we know that most professional sports
 
04:23:41.269 --> 04:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
teams are requiring
 
04:23:43.429 --> 04:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
the covid vaccine
 
04:23:45.429 --> 04:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
they're requiring it
 
04:23:47.030 --> 04:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
i mean we see this on tv all the time
 
04:23:48.550 --> 04:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
the few outliers that are like i'm not
 
04:23:49.830 --> 04:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
04:23:49.840 --> 04:23:50.790 align:start position:0%
doing it
so

04:23:50.790 --> 04:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:53.189 --> 04:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
there's there's a real concern
 
04:23:55.830 --> 04:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
especially when pfizer did not ever
 
04:23:57.750 --> 04:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
check these young men i mean they could
 
04:23:59.269 --> 04:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
have done things like d-dimers
 
04:24:01.429 --> 04:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
pre-imposed they didn't do it they chose
 
04:24:03.510 --> 04:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
not to do it even though they admitted
 
04:24:04.870 --> 04:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
that there was a possibility of
 
04:24:07.269 --> 04:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
myocarditis when they were going to do
 
04:24:10.630 --> 04:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
the study on smaller children
 
04:24:13.670 --> 04:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
like why would you subject a child to
 
04:24:15.590 --> 04:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
heart disease
 
04:24:17.990 --> 04:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
for a disease process that naturally
 
04:24:21.110 --> 04:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
they have a runny nose for 12 hours
 
04:24:23.510 --> 04:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's what they proved
 
04:24:25.429 --> 04:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
that's what they proved adverse events
 
04:24:27.830 --> 04:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
were high they may have lowered the case
 
04:24:30.870 --> 04:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
rate but the adverse events were so high
 
04:24:34.149 --> 04:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
that it does not justify
 
04:24:37.349 --> 04:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
the benefit the risk benefit ratio of
 
04:24:39.030 --> 04:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
04:24:42.469 --> 04:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
vaccine is so out of whack
 
04:24:44.389 --> 04:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
that anyone should be able to see this
 
04:24:46.070 --> 04:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
you don't need to be a physician to see
 
04:24:46.080 --> 04:24:50.630 align:start position:0%
you don't need to be a physician to see
this

04:24:50.630 --> 04:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:52.630 --> 04:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
okay i'm gonna let i'm gonna all out two
 
04:24:55.429 --> 04:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
more questions from this witness
 
04:24:59.349 --> 04:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
representative gay has one of them
 
04:25:00.389 --> 04:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:25:02.790 --> 04:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking taking my
 
04:25:04.469 --> 04:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
question i used to take my mother to
 
04:25:06.710 --> 04:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
webster for her doctoral
 
04:25:06.720 --> 04:25:08.469 align:start position:0%
webster for her doctoral
appointments

04:25:08.469 --> 04:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
appointments
 
04:25:09.750 --> 04:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
i'll just ask them together and you
 
04:25:11.670 --> 04:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
answer what you want
 
04:25:14.870 --> 04:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
how does teen myocarditis present
 
04:25:17.750 --> 04:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
how many of your patients opted out
 
04:25:21.510 --> 04:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
since you have never ever had to report
 
04:25:24.790 --> 04:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
to theirs on your patients so far up
 
04:25:26.469 --> 04:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
until coded
 
04:25:29.510 --> 04:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
is anyone answering your calls on
 
04:25:29.520 --> 04:25:33.110 align:start position:0%
is anyone answering your calls on
treatment

04:25:33.110 --> 04:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:35.349 --> 04:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
so as far as the opt out for my patient
 
04:25:37.670 --> 04:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
population um there are people that opt
 
04:25:39.349 --> 04:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
out and if we have a reasonable
 
04:25:42.149 --> 04:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
conversation um we wait we we change the
 
04:25:43.590 --> 04:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
schedule a little bit that's totally
 
04:25:45.750 --> 04:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
fine with me especially post covid this
 
04:25:48.070 --> 04:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
has been been extremely eye-opening for
 
04:25:49.910 --> 04:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
pediatrician who
 
04:25:49.920 --> 04:25:50.710 align:start position:0%
pediatrician who
um

04:25:50.710 --> 04:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:53.670 --> 04:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
honestly i i like vaccine i mean i have
 
04:25:55.590 --> 04:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
i haven't had to stick a needle in a
 
04:25:58.389 --> 04:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
kid's back for meningitis for 15 years i
 
04:26:00.870 --> 04:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
haven't seen a whole bunch of bleeding
 
04:26:00.880 --> 04:26:01.670 align:start position:0%
haven't seen a whole bunch of bleeding
and

04:26:01.670 --> 04:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:26:04.870 --> 04:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
purulent ears gushing and i haven't sent
 
04:26:06.710 --> 04:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
kids to the hospital for pneumonia
 
04:26:06.720 --> 04:26:07.750 align:start position:0%
kids to the hospital for pneumonia
frankly

04:26:07.750 --> 04:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
04:26:09.990 --> 04:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's all because of prevnar
 
04:26:12.229 --> 04:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
i like that particular vaccine it's
 
04:26:14.469 --> 04:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
pretty dang good
 
04:26:16.710 --> 04:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
but when we're talking about
 
04:26:19.349 --> 04:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
the covid vaccine it's been there's no
 
04:26:21.990 --> 04:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
animal studies these vaccines take 10
 
04:26:24.070 --> 04:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
years it's not even been a year yet and
 
04:26:27.189 --> 04:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
we have 1774
 
04:26:29.349 --> 04:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
kids with heart disease it hasn't even
 
04:26:31.030 --> 04:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
been out a year
 
04:26:32.389 --> 04:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
wake up
 
04:26:34.950 --> 04:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
this is dangerous
 
04:26:36.630 --> 04:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
our signal
 
04:26:37.990 --> 04:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
is less than
 
04:26:39.510 --> 04:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
25 deaths
 
04:26:43.590 --> 04:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
and we had in the post eua
 
04:26:46.389 --> 04:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
over 1200 deaths
 
04:26:48.550 --> 04:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
1200 deaths and to date
 
04:26:50.550 --> 04:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
i know i have the date i know i have the
 
04:26:52.469 --> 04:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
the number here
 
04:26:55.750 --> 04:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
from the vaccine i mean it's like 24 23
 
04:26:59.429 --> 04:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
149 deaths from this vaccine
 
04:27:01.510 --> 04:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
when's it going to stop
 
04:27:02.870 --> 04:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor we're going to be
 
04:27:05.510 --> 04:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
moving it along more quickly now
 
04:27:08.469 --> 04:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
anyone who has not asked a question of
 
04:27:12.550 --> 04:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:16.309 --> 04:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:26.550 --> 04:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:26.560 --> 04:27:27.670 align:start position:0%
 
mike

04:27:27.670 --> 04:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
mike
 
04:27:30.710 --> 04:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh location ethnicity um age
 
04:27:33.030 --> 04:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
distribution approximately just so i can
 
04:27:35.189 --> 04:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
get a sense of what kind of population
 
04:27:36.630 --> 04:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with sure
 
04:27:39.269 --> 04:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
um so i'm from so my practices in
 
04:27:40.710 --> 04:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
webster texas
 
04:27:44.149 --> 04:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
um we that it's a suburb of houston so
 
04:27:45.830 --> 04:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
houston has a catchment area of over
 
04:27:47.429 --> 04:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
seven million people
 
04:27:49.510 --> 04:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
um i don't catch all seven million thank
 
04:27:49.520 --> 04:27:50.389 align:start position:0%
um i don't catch all seven million thank
you

04:27:50.389 --> 04:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:27:53.510 --> 04:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
um we i see babies from
 
04:27:56.710 --> 04:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
one day old all the way up
 
04:27:59.189 --> 04:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
i take i keep some of my high risk
 
04:28:01.429 --> 04:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
population kiddos you know that have
 
04:28:03.189 --> 04:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
cerebral palsy
 
04:28:07.030 --> 04:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:09.110 --> 04:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
down syndrome you know things like that
 
04:28:11.429 --> 04:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
that really adult docs have a hard time
 
04:28:13.110 --> 04:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
with i keep those kids
 
04:28:13.120 --> 04:28:14.149 align:start position:0%
with i keep those kids
um

04:28:14.149 --> 04:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:15.990 --> 04:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
i've been in practice over 25 years my
 
04:28:16.000 --> 04:28:17.510 align:start position:0%
i've been in practice over 25 years my
demographics

04:28:17.510 --> 04:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
demographics
 
04:28:20.070 --> 04:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
are generally um
 
04:28:22.149 --> 04:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
either self-employed
 
04:28:25.030 --> 04:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
or insured patient population
 
04:28:27.030 --> 04:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
um i have
 
04:28:29.990 --> 04:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
in excess of
 
04:28:31.910 --> 04:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
i've ten you know over the years i've
 
04:28:33.750 --> 04:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
given tens of thousands of vaccines so
 
04:28:35.510 --> 04:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
that tells you how many patients i have
 
04:28:36.469 --> 04:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
04:28:36.479 --> 04:28:37.510 align:start position:0%
a lot
um

04:28:37.510 --> 04:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:40.389 --> 04:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
and um as it's a mix because i am in
 
04:28:42.389 --> 04:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
texas so we have hispanic we have white
 
04:28:45.670 --> 04:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
we have black we have many international
 
04:28:47.990 --> 04:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
because we're right next to nasa um so
 
04:28:49.670 --> 04:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of international families
 
04:28:49.680 --> 04:28:50.550 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of international families
there

04:28:50.550 --> 04:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:28:53.110 --> 04:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
so we have a really nice
 
04:28:56.630 --> 04:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
mix of every ethnicity
 
04:28:58.550 --> 04:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
you know predominantly white just
 
04:29:00.630 --> 04:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
because we're in texas i guess but a lot
 
04:29:02.630 --> 04:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
of the hispanics consider themselves
 
04:29:05.590 --> 04:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
white too if you ask them um
 
04:29:08.070 --> 04:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
so we we have a very nice mix of
 
04:29:08.080 --> 04:29:10.550 align:start position:0%
so we we have a very nice mix of
everything

04:29:10.550 --> 04:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
everything
 
04:29:12.229 --> 04:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and thank you for
 
04:29:14.630 --> 04:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
coming before us as promised two more
 
04:29:17.590 --> 04:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
and i have done the two more
 
04:29:20.229 --> 04:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
so now the chair calls paula mckinnon
 
04:29:22.309 --> 04:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire school nurses she
 
04:29:24.070 --> 04:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
says she wants to speak for three
 
04:29:24.080 --> 04:29:25.830 align:start position:0%
says she wants to speak for three
minutes

04:29:25.830 --> 04:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
04:29:38.710 --> 04:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:46.630 --> 04:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:47.990 --> 04:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire school nurses
 
04:29:50.469 --> 04:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
association supports this bill just
 
04:29:52.870 --> 04:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
three weeks ago dr chan and his team
 
04:29:55.510 --> 04:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
reported 117
 
04:29:59.110 --> 04:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
active clusters of covid19 in k-12
 
04:30:01.830 --> 04:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
schools each one of those clusters had
 
04:30:05.429 --> 04:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
12.8 cases per cluster
 
04:30:08.149 --> 04:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
all policy considerations for schools
 
04:30:09.990 --> 04:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
start with a goal of keeping students
 
04:30:12.550 --> 04:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
safe and physically present in schools
 
04:30:14.070 --> 04:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines are one of the best
 
04:30:16.229 --> 04:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
preventative measures to create a safe
 
04:30:18.469 --> 04:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
environment for learning vaccination
 
04:30:20.070 --> 04:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
will decrease the disruption of
 
04:30:22.469 --> 04:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
education by significantly reducing
 
04:30:25.030 --> 04:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
outbreaks in schools and keeping kids in
 
04:30:27.429 --> 04:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
school where they belong
 
04:30:29.910 --> 04:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
the first step of course is the full fda
 
04:30:32.630 --> 04:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
approval of the covid19 vaccine not
 
04:30:35.269 --> 04:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
simply a temporary authorization and at
 
04:30:38.469 --> 04:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
this time 50 states have requirements
 
04:30:41.670 --> 04:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
for other vaccines in place for students
 
04:30:43.910 --> 04:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
we cannot predict that there won't be
 
04:30:47.189 --> 04:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
another variant like the omicron
 
04:30:49.590 --> 04:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
let's get prepared to fight the fight
 
04:30:51.750 --> 04:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's time to get coveted behind us just
 
04:30:54.309 --> 04:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
like all other vaccine preventable
 
04:30:54.319 --> 04:30:55.429 align:start position:0%
like all other vaccine preventable
diseases

04:30:55.429 --> 04:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
04:30:58.469 --> 04:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
and i didn't use my three minutes um but
 
04:31:00.389 --> 04:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
would you take a question i would be
 
04:31:02.630 --> 04:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
happy to take a question or two
 
04:31:04.630 --> 04:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
questions for ms mckinnon from the
 
04:31:06.469 --> 04:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
school nurses
 
04:31:06.479 --> 04:31:08.229 align:start position:0%

representative king
 
04:31:49.590 --> 04:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:31:52.229 --> 04:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:31:52.239 --> 04:31:53.110 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

04:31:53.110 --> 04:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:55.110 --> 04:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
you say fight the fight
 
04:31:56.950 --> 04:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
is um
 
04:31:58.229 --> 04:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
there are other
 
04:32:00.389 --> 04:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
methods of fighting the fight other than
 
04:32:03.189 --> 04:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
the vaccine
 
04:32:05.910 --> 04:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
but a lot of people discredit them
 
04:32:09.189 --> 04:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
things such as vitamin d and e
 
04:32:10.950 --> 04:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
and zinc
 
04:32:10.960 --> 04:32:13.510 align:start position:0%
and zinc
and

04:32:13.510 --> 04:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:15.910 --> 04:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
building up your immune system through
 
04:32:17.349 --> 04:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
healthy diet
 
04:32:19.189 --> 04:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
sleeping and
 
04:32:21.590 --> 04:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh maybe even chiropractic
 
04:32:23.510 --> 04:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
um there's even been mention of
 
04:32:25.750 --> 04:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
ivermectin and
 
04:32:27.590 --> 04:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
um and yet
 
04:32:30.229 --> 04:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh we discount those how do you feel
 
04:32:32.870 --> 04:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
about uh alternative ways of fighting
 
04:32:35.830 --> 04:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
the fight i certainly don't discount
 
04:32:39.349 --> 04:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
many of the things that you mention
 
04:32:41.349 --> 04:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
the more preventative measures that you
 
04:32:42.710 --> 04:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
have in place
 
04:32:44.950 --> 04:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
the better vaccines are one of them
 
04:32:47.269 --> 04:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
vitamin d certainly is another one
 
04:32:50.389 --> 04:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
proper sleep taking care of yourself
 
04:32:53.349 --> 04:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
is certainly all of those things
 
04:32:55.189 --> 04:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
when it comes to schools this isn't this
 
04:32:57.110 --> 04:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
particular bill but when it comes to
 
04:32:57.120 --> 04:32:58.070 align:start position:0%
particular bill but when it comes to
school

04:32:58.070 --> 04:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:32:59.349 --> 04:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
you should be using all of the
 
04:32:59.359 --> 04:33:00.550 align:start position:0%
you should be using all of the
mitigation

04:33:00.550 --> 04:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
mitigation
 
04:33:02.710 --> 04:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
strategies that are available to you and
 
04:33:04.470 --> 04:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
most of them are most of them are
 
04:33:06.551 --> 04:33:06.561 align:start position:0%
masking most of them are taking
 
04:33:09.109 --> 04:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
precautions for social distancing and
 
04:33:12.310 --> 04:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
vaccination is the next step to get us
 
04:33:14.310 --> 04:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
where we need to be so that we can have
 
04:33:18.551 --> 04:33:18.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:20.310 --> 04:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
one more question of
 
04:33:22.709 --> 04:33:22.719 align:start position:0%

where should i give the copies of my
testimony

04:33:28.830 --> 04:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:33:31.109 --> 04:33:31.119 align:start position:0%
here thank you for bringing written
 
04:33:31.119 --> 04:33:33.109 align:start position:0%
here thank you for bringing written
testimony

04:33:35.830 --> 04:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes kathleen letter
 
04:33:37.590 --> 04:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
she's wanted to speak for 10 minutes
 
04:33:39.349 --> 04:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get 10 minutes you
 
04:33:41.670 --> 04:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
are going to speak with incredible
 
04:33:45.189 --> 04:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
articulation for about two minutes and i
 
04:33:47.349 --> 04:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
will now hand around
 
04:33:52.470 --> 04:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:55.269 --> 04:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
yeah i i um
 
04:33:57.670 --> 04:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
two minutes it's going to be hard to do
 
04:33:57.680 --> 04:33:59.269 align:start position:0%
two minutes it's going to be hard to do
but

04:33:59.269 --> 04:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:34:00.230 --> 04:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
i was
 
04:34:01.910 --> 04:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
very very thankful to the doctor from
 
04:34:04.150 --> 04:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
texas because she said it all
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
and i because that's where i started
 
04:34:09.349 --> 04:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
from in my head was risk reward
 
04:34:11.670 --> 04:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
and the papers that you're getting show
 
04:34:13.830 --> 04:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
the actual most current
 
04:34:16.150 --> 04:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
coveted cases in new hampshire
 
04:34:17.510 --> 04:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
and the death rate
 
04:34:17.520 --> 04:34:18.949 align:start position:0%
and the death rate
and

04:34:18.949 --> 04:34:18.959 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:21.590 --> 04:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
zero to nine um
 
04:34:23.910 --> 04:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
one death this is for the whole period
 
04:34:26.150 --> 04:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
of covid
 
04:34:28.070 --> 04:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
that's zero percent
 
04:34:31.269 --> 04:34:31.279 align:start position:0%
uh ages 10 to 19 zero
 
04:34:31.279 --> 04:34:32.230 align:start position:0%
uh ages 10 to 19 zero
deaths

04:34:32.230 --> 04:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
04:34:35.029 --> 04:34:35.039 align:start position:0%
that's also zero so for the ages of zero
 
04:34:39.830 --> 04:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh to 19 there were was one death
 
04:34:45.510 --> 04:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:48.869 --> 04:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
rate okay so that being said that's
 
04:34:49.990 --> 04:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
the risk
 
04:34:52.310 --> 04:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
of to these children
 
04:34:55.590 --> 04:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
by the new hampshire statistics here
 
04:34:55.600 --> 04:34:56.629 align:start position:0%
by the new hampshire statistics here
the

04:34:56.629 --> 04:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:34:59.429 --> 04:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
risk of the vaccine as a doctor from
 
04:35:01.109 --> 04:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
texas i'm sorry i don't remember your
 
04:35:01.119 --> 04:35:02.789 align:start position:0%
texas i'm sorry i don't remember your
name

04:35:02.789 --> 04:35:02.799 align:start position:0%
name
 
04:35:05.510 --> 04:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
is much much much higher
 
04:35:07.349 --> 04:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
and the thing that is not ever being
 
04:35:10.551 --> 04:35:10.561 align:start position:0%
mentioned i just it drives me crazy
 
04:35:12.150 --> 04:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
do you know does everybody here
 
04:35:13.750 --> 04:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
understand that the pharmaceutical
 
04:35:16.070 --> 04:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
companies have no liability
 
04:35:16.080 --> 04:35:17.269 align:start position:0%
companies have no liability
none

04:35:17.269 --> 04:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
none
 
04:35:17.279 --> 04:35:18.551 align:start position:0%
none
none

04:35:18.551 --> 04:35:18.561 align:start position:0%
none
 
04:35:21.670 --> 04:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
and that's huge i mean big pharma is
 
04:35:23.189 --> 04:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
having a field day they're walking
 
04:35:25.269 --> 04:35:25.279 align:start position:0%
around with billions of dollars
 
04:35:26.709 --> 04:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
they're censoring
 
04:35:28.789 --> 04:35:28.799 align:start position:0%
discussions around this will not be it
 
04:35:30.709 --> 04:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
will not be allowed
 
04:35:30.719 --> 04:35:31.990 align:start position:0%
will not be allowed
um

04:35:31.990 --> 04:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:34.470 --> 04:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
and the whole various report the current
 
04:35:36.470 --> 04:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
vares report is
 
04:35:39.510 --> 04:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
is like right now it's like 23 000
 
04:35:39.520 --> 04:35:40.510 align:start position:0%
is like right now it's like 23 000
deaths

and um
 
04:35:58.310 --> 04:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
and what's interesting is the lazarus
 
04:36:01.429 --> 04:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
study which was the one percent
 
04:36:01.439 --> 04:36:02.789 align:start position:0%
study which was the one percent
um

04:36:02.789 --> 04:36:02.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:04.709 --> 04:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
that's actually being reported to verse
 
04:36:07.670 --> 04:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
that comes from a study that was done um
 
04:36:07.680 --> 04:36:08.470 align:start position:0%
that comes from a study that was done um
by

04:36:08.470 --> 04:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:36:10.310 --> 04:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
the they call it the lazarus study you
 
04:36:11.590 --> 04:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
can look it up
 
04:36:11.600 --> 04:36:12.709 align:start position:0%
can look it up
um

04:36:12.709 --> 04:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:12.719 --> 04:36:13.510 align:start position:0%
um
but

04:36:13.510 --> 04:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:36:16.551 --> 04:36:16.561 align:start position:0%
but this is interesting the cdc oh is it
 
04:36:19.429 --> 04:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
my done well almost it means you get two
 
04:36:21.590 --> 04:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
very well put together paragraphs to
 
04:36:25.189 --> 04:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
conclude the cdc actually
 
04:36:27.830 --> 04:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh asked for the study this is how when
 
04:36:29.429 --> 04:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
they didn't liked hearing that it was
 
04:36:32.070 --> 04:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
only one percent effective this is what
 
04:36:34.789 --> 04:36:34.799 align:start position:0%
the study concludes unfortunately there
 
04:36:36.551 --> 04:36:36.561 align:start position:0%
was never an opportunity to perform
 
04:36:38.230 --> 04:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
system pro system performance
 
04:36:40.470 --> 04:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
assessments because the cdc contacts
 
04:36:42.949 --> 04:36:42.959 align:start position:0%
were no longer available and the cdc
 
04:36:44.629 --> 04:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
consultants responsible for receiving
 
04:36:46.470 --> 04:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
data will no longer responsive to our
 
04:36:48.150 --> 04:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
multiple requests to proceed with
 
04:36:50.390 --> 04:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
testing and evaluation of the system i
 
04:36:52.070 --> 04:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
think we could start with that and leave
 
04:36:55.189 --> 04:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
us with that what i think we could ask
 
04:36:56.709 --> 04:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
you now thank you so much for your
 
04:36:56.719 --> 04:36:57.830 align:start position:0%
you now thank you so much for your
testimony

the department is here to provide
 
04:38:03.029 --> 04:38:03.039 align:start position:0%
information on hb 1633 relative to
 
04:38:05.349 --> 04:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
requiring cova vaccination for school
 
04:38:06.869 --> 04:38:06.879 align:start position:0%
attendance and i'm just going to check
 
04:38:09.189 --> 04:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
you can all hear me
 
04:38:10.709 --> 04:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
thank you

thank you
 
04:38:14.310 --> 04:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
the pfizer bion tech covet vaccine is
 
04:38:16.629 --> 04:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
currently authorized for use by the fda
 
04:38:18.789 --> 04:38:18.799 align:start position:0%
for ages 16 and older
 
04:38:20.869 --> 04:38:20.879 align:start position:0%
for children 5 to 15 the vaccine is
 
04:38:22.470 --> 04:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
currently under emergency use
 
04:38:24.629 --> 04:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
authorization and review is currently
 
04:38:27.269 --> 04:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
underway that may soon allow coven 19
 
04:38:29.029 --> 04:38:29.039 align:start position:0%
vaccine to be available for children
 
04:38:30.470 --> 04:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
five and under
 
04:38:33.189 --> 04:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
under these criteria the legislation
 
04:38:36.070 --> 04:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
would require anyone age 16 and over
 
04:38:37.670 --> 04:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
including those in college to be
 
04:38:40.949 --> 04:38:40.959 align:start position:0%
vaccinated for covid19 for school entry
 
04:38:43.349 --> 04:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
the department has no intention of
 
04:38:45.109 --> 04:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
adding immunization requirements for
 
04:38:47.670 --> 04:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
code 19 at this time
 
04:38:50.070 --> 04:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
as relates to covet 19 there have been
 
04:38:52.949 --> 04:38:52.959 align:start position:0%
over 38 000 doses given to adolescents
 
04:38:54.230 --> 04:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
04:38:56.070 --> 04:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
despite their lower risk of severe
 
04:38:58.869 --> 04:38:58.879 align:start position:0%
covid19 disease children and adolescents
 
04:39:00.709 --> 04:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
have been disproportionately affected by
 
04:39:04.310 --> 04:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
cova 19 control measures
 
04:39:06.949 --> 04:39:06.959 align:start position:0%
the most important indirect effects are
 
04:39:08.789 --> 04:39:08.799 align:start position:0%
related to school closures which have
 
04:39:10.789 --> 04:39:10.799 align:start position:0%
disrupted the provision of educational
 
04:39:12.949 --> 04:39:12.959 align:start position:0%
services and increased emotional
 
04:39:15.590 --> 04:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
distress and mental health problems
 
04:39:17.910 --> 04:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
vaccination of student offers an
 
04:39:19.910 --> 04:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
additional layer of protection against
 
04:39:22.949 --> 04:39:22.959 align:start position:0%
covet 19 and can be an important tool to
 
04:39:25.189 --> 04:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
return to normal
 
04:39:27.109 --> 04:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
higher levels of vaccine coverage can
 
04:39:29.349 --> 04:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
lead to less community transmission
 
04:39:31.269 --> 04:39:31.279 align:start position:0%
which can protect against the
 
04:39:33.429 --> 04:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
development and circulation of emerging
 
04:39:33.439 --> 04:39:35.590 align:start position:0%
development and circulation of emerging
variants

04:39:35.590 --> 04:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
variants
 
04:39:37.830 --> 04:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
the department seeks to appropriately
 
04:39:40.310 --> 04:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
balance individual and parental choice
 
04:39:41.750 --> 04:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
and the goal of keeping children
 
04:39:43.510 --> 04:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
enrolled in school while protecting the
 
04:39:45.190 --> 04:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
health of all children
 
04:39:46.868 --> 04:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
in the event that a consensus to
 
04:39:48.708 --> 04:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
recommend covet 19 vaccination
 
04:39:50.788 --> 04:39:50.798 align:start position:0%
requirements for school in child care is
 
04:39:52.788 --> 04:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
reached in the future the department
 
04:39:55.110 --> 04:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
would then examine the key criteria
 
04:39:57.750 --> 04:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
including but not limited limited to
 
04:40:00.948 --> 04:40:00.958 align:start position:0%
vaccine efficacy vaccine safety severity
 
04:40:03.510 --> 04:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
of disease likelihood of infection and
 
04:40:06.230 --> 04:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
method of transmission prior to making
 
04:40:08.070 --> 04:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
such recommendation
 
04:40:10.230 --> 04:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
any administrative rule processes to
 
04:40:11.910 --> 04:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
adopt a new school immunization
 
04:40:14.390 --> 04:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
requirement would involve feedback from
 
04:40:14.400 --> 04:40:15.670 align:start position:0%
requirement would involve feedback from
public

04:40:15.670 --> 04:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:40:20.948 --> 04:40:20.958 align:start position:0%
pursuant to rsa 541 a 11.
 
04:40:22.708 --> 04:40:22.718 align:start position:0%
the department supports the proposed
 
04:40:25.510 --> 04:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
expanded definition of school in h.b
 
04:40:25.520 --> 04:40:27.110 align:start position:0%

1633
 
04:40:30.708 --> 04:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
to include post-secondary institution as
 
04:40:34.390 --> 04:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
proposed by hb 1633 however given the
 
04:40:36.868 --> 04:40:36.878 align:start position:0%
novel nature of covet 19
 
04:40:39.430 --> 04:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
a consensus to recommend covet 19
 
04:40:41.670 --> 04:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
vaccination for school requirements has
 
04:40:45.190 --> 04:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
not been yet achieved by the department
 
04:40:47.350 --> 04:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
we continue to urge parents to educate
 
04:40:49.270 --> 04:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
themselves on the benefits of coven 19
 
04:40:51.590 --> 04:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine for eligible children and to
 
04:40:53.030 --> 04:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
reach out to a child's health care
 
04:40:54.708 --> 04:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
provider with any questions they may
 
04:40:57.350 --> 04:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
have related to the disease
 
04:40:59.110 --> 04:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time i'm
 
04:41:00.708 --> 04:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you may
 
04:41:03.670 --> 04:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
have mr mccurry if there is no consensus
 
04:41:03.680 --> 04:41:05.190 align:start position:0%
have mr mccurry if there is no consensus
now

04:41:05.190 --> 04:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:41:07.430 --> 04:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that if this bill
 
04:41:09.430 --> 04:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
were to pass
 
04:41:14.150 --> 04:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:15.750 --> 04:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
04:41:17.270 --> 04:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr lee
 
04:41:22.230 --> 04:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:27.270 --> 04:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:28.868 --> 04:41:28.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:41:36.390 --> 04:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:38.230 --> 04:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
aren't the variants
 
04:41:42.150 --> 04:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
responses different to the vaccines the
 
04:41:45.030 --> 04:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
different vaccines and isn't the vaccine
 
04:41:47.910 --> 04:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's used for coven 19 specifically
 
04:41:51.350 --> 04:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
targeted at like delta and the previous
 
04:41:55.270 --> 04:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
variant and hasn't it been
 
04:41:58.628 --> 04:41:58.638 align:start position:0%
discovered that the vaccine is
 
04:42:01.270 --> 04:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
a lot less effective on the latest
 
04:42:03.030 --> 04:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
variant and we don't know what it's
 
04:42:05.270 --> 04:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
going to do with the other variants and
 
04:42:07.590 --> 04:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
after hearing the anecdotal and
 
04:42:09.510 --> 04:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
statistical evidence from the previous
 
04:42:09.520 --> 04:42:10.788 align:start position:0%
statistical evidence from the previous
speaker

04:42:10.788 --> 04:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
04:42:12.628 --> 04:42:12.638 align:start position:0%
don't you
 
04:42:14.708 --> 04:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
think we might want to pump the brakes
 
04:42:14.718 --> 04:42:16.868 align:start position:0%
think we might want to pump the brakes
on

04:42:16.868 --> 04:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:42:19.190 --> 04:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
giving these vaccines
 
04:42:21.750 --> 04:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
without having
 
04:42:21.760 --> 04:42:22.868 align:start position:0%
without having
uh

04:42:22.868 --> 04:42:22.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:42:22.878 --> 04:42:28.230 align:start position:0%
uh
trials

04:42:28.230 --> 04:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:30.628 --> 04:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question
 
04:42:31.990 --> 04:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
um the
 
04:42:34.788 --> 04:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
research is evolving about this
 
04:42:37.510 --> 04:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to know know and what we
 
04:42:39.750 --> 04:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
don't know about cobit vaccine
 
04:42:41.670 --> 04:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
and about the disease the pandemic is
 
04:42:43.750 --> 04:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
evolving in its nature
 
04:42:45.830 --> 04:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
um as such i think that it is important
 
04:42:48.550 --> 04:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
that we continue to consider what the
 
04:42:51.910 --> 04:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
research is prior to making all these
 
04:42:54.788 --> 04:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
recommendations so we are
 
04:42:56.948 --> 04:42:56.958 align:start position:0%
really wanting individual families to be
 
04:42:59.750 --> 04:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
able to have those discussions with the
 
04:42:59.760 --> 04:43:01.190 align:start position:0%
able to have those discussions with the
providers

04:43:01.190 --> 04:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
providers
 
04:43:03.590 --> 04:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
so that they understand
 
04:43:05.510 --> 04:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
what is in the best interest of their
 
04:43:09.110 --> 04:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:13.830 --> 04:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:21.110 --> 04:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:22.948 --> 04:43:22.958 align:start position:0%
and now looking at the stack of pink
 
04:43:24.948 --> 04:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
cards i have
 
04:43:26.708 --> 04:43:26.718 align:start position:0%
if you were just turned loose we would
 
04:43:29.750 --> 04:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
be locked in for the night
 
04:43:31.830 --> 04:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
since i don't see any sleeping bags or
 
04:43:33.990 --> 04:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
teddy bears
 
04:43:37.670 --> 04:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask that truly
 
04:43:40.310 --> 04:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
you speak in to two minutes
 
04:43:42.070 --> 04:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
so those of you while you're waiting to
 
04:43:45.590 --> 04:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
be called upon if you could write it out
 
04:43:47.590 --> 04:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
boil it down
 
04:43:50.628 --> 04:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
we would much appreciate that
 
04:43:53.110 --> 04:43:53.120 align:start position:0%

um
i

04:44:26.788 --> 04:44:26.798 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:44:29.510 --> 04:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
will chop down my testimony as much as i
 
04:44:30.868 --> 04:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
can um
 
04:44:32.788 --> 04:44:32.798 align:start position:0%
the doctor from texas did a wonderful
 
04:44:35.190 --> 04:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
job at addressing a lot that i wanted to
 
04:44:36.470 --> 04:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
say so
 
04:44:38.788 --> 04:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
uh here i go
 
04:44:38.798 --> 04:44:39.670 align:start position:0%
uh here i go
um

04:44:39.670 --> 04:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:41.510 --> 04:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
ready okay
 
04:44:44.150 --> 04:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing right now
 
04:44:46.948 --> 04:44:46.958 align:start position:0%
in no uncertain terms
 
04:44:49.670 --> 04:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
are crimes against humanity in real time
 
04:44:52.070 --> 04:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's hard to process what's blatantly
 
04:44:53.910 --> 04:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
obvious sometimes but that's exactly
 
04:44:55.190 --> 04:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
what this is
 
04:44:57.750 --> 04:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
mandating this shot flies in the face of
 
04:45:00.070 --> 04:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
medical ethics and bioethic core
 
04:45:00.080 --> 04:45:01.510 align:start position:0%
medical ethics and bioethic core
principles

04:45:01.510 --> 04:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
principles
 
04:45:04.150 --> 04:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
developed since the nuremberg code
 
04:45:05.990 --> 04:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's bad enough that agency directors
 
04:45:07.350 --> 04:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
and politicians have gotten away with
 
04:45:09.430 --> 04:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
mandating the shot for adults as a
 
04:45:11.910 --> 04:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
condition of employment but to try to
 
04:45:13.990 --> 04:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
impose it on children as a condition for
 
04:45:16.948 --> 04:45:16.958 align:start position:0%
education is a new low and knowing what
 
04:45:19.910 --> 04:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
we know today it's immoral
 
04:45:21.350 --> 04:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
there are multitude
 
04:45:23.270 --> 04:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
there are multitude of reasons why this
 
04:45:26.070 --> 04:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
concept and this bill are ridiculous and
 
04:45:28.230 --> 04:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
why mandates are completely irrelevant
 
04:45:29.670 --> 04:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
but let's start with the obvious
 
04:45:32.150 --> 04:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
transmission it does nothing to stop
 
04:45:34.628 --> 04:45:34.638 align:start position:0%
viral spread and in fact may actually be
 
04:45:36.628 --> 04:45:36.638 align:start position:0%
increasing it
 
04:45:38.390 --> 04:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
we're seeing something called negative
 
04:45:40.868 --> 04:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
vaccine efficacy which means exactly how
 
04:45:43.270 --> 04:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
it sounds that not only are the vaccines
 
04:45:44.550 --> 04:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
not controlling infection and
 
04:45:46.708 --> 04:45:46.718 align:start position:0%
transmission but they are actually
 
04:45:46.718 --> 04:45:48.070 align:start position:0%
transmission but they are actually
accelerating

04:45:48.070 --> 04:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
accelerating
 
04:45:50.948 --> 04:45:50.958 align:start position:0%
infection and transmission
 
04:45:52.550 --> 04:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
maybe we should spend some time looking
 
04:45:54.390 --> 04:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
into that before we create a bunch of
 
04:45:56.230 --> 04:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
school age super spreaders which is
 
04:45:57.590 --> 04:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
ironically what the media has been
 
04:46:00.150 --> 04:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
trying to scare us with all along
 
04:46:01.830 --> 04:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
next we have the long-term safety
 
04:46:04.310 --> 04:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
profile or complete lack thereof
 
04:46:05.910 --> 04:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
no one on this planet can tell you what
 
04:46:07.590 --> 04:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
the effects of the shot will be in five
 
04:46:10.230 --> 04:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
years or ten years time yet the sponsors
 
04:46:12.070 --> 04:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
of this bill would like to inject our
 
04:46:12.080 --> 04:46:13.030 align:start position:0%
of this bill would like to inject our
children

04:46:13.030 --> 04:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:46:15.590 --> 04:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
your children your grandchildren
 
04:46:19.270 --> 04:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
with a product surrounded by unknowns
 
04:46:21.350 --> 04:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
why on earth would we be so reckless
 
04:46:23.750 --> 04:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
with a novel product on such a massive
 
04:46:23.760 --> 04:46:25.030 align:start position:0%
with a novel product on such a massive
scale

04:46:25.030 --> 04:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
scale
 
04:46:28.070 --> 04:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
15 seconds oh boy
 
04:46:28.080 --> 04:46:29.270 align:start position:0%
15 seconds oh boy
okay

04:46:29.270 --> 04:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:46:33.510 --> 04:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
um okay let's let's get right to it then
 
04:46:35.990 --> 04:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
nelson mandela said there can be no
 
04:46:39.190 --> 04:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
keener revelation of a society's soul
 
04:46:40.788 --> 04:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
than the way in which it treats its
 
04:46:42.470 --> 04:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
children it's fair to say that our
 
04:46:44.628 --> 04:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
collective soul as a nation is in
 
04:46:46.550 --> 04:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
turmoil it is fighting an internal
 
04:46:48.948 --> 04:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
battle of good versus evil right versus
 
04:46:48.958 --> 04:46:49.830 align:start position:0%
battle of good versus evil right versus
wrong

04:46:49.830 --> 04:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
04:46:52.070 --> 04:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
mandates of this product for any person
 
04:46:55.110 --> 04:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
in any circumstance is baseless reckless
 
04:46:57.030 --> 04:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
and utterly asinine
 
04:46:58.708 --> 04:46:58.718 align:start position:0%
why are we pretending these shots
 
04:47:01.350 --> 04:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
contribute anything to public health if
 
04:47:03.430 --> 04:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
anything they're stripping it away
 
04:47:05.430 --> 04:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
nothing has been as crystal clear over
 
04:47:07.510 --> 04:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
the last two years as this
 
04:47:09.830 --> 04:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's a charade and the majority is
 
04:47:11.430 --> 04:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
finally waking up to it and we're
 
04:47:13.910 --> 04:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
watching we're taking note of lawmakers
 
04:47:17.750 --> 04:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
judgment of actions and of integrity
 
04:47:19.990 --> 04:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
please oppose this bill
 
04:47:21.750 --> 04:47:21.760 align:start position:0%

i never expected to be here
 
04:48:04.070 --> 04:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
but i want to share what happened to my
 
04:48:07.350 --> 04:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
daughter because of a vaccine mandate at
 
04:48:08.788 --> 04:48:08.798 align:start position:0%
her college
 
04:48:11.510 --> 04:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
and how it has changed our life and our
 
04:48:11.520 --> 04:48:13.190 align:start position:0%
and how it has changed our life and our
family

04:48:13.190 --> 04:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
family
 
04:48:15.030 --> 04:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
for the past six months and is
 
04:48:15.040 --> 04:48:17.190 align:start position:0%
for the past six months and is
continuing

04:48:17.190 --> 04:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
continuing
 
04:48:19.510 --> 04:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
my 18 year old daughter was subjected to
 
04:48:22.310 --> 04:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
a coven 19 vaccine mandate in order to
 
04:48:24.948 --> 04:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
attend the college of her choice
 
04:48:27.750 --> 04:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
after 18 months of lockdown losing the
 
04:48:29.910 --> 04:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
end of her junior year most of her
 
04:48:31.830 --> 04:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
senior year
 
04:48:34.788 --> 04:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
we she was excited to go to college and
 
04:48:38.948 --> 04:48:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:42.470 --> 04:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
we didn't want her to get the coveted 19
 
04:48:42.480 --> 04:48:43.670 align:start position:0%
we didn't want her to get the coveted 19
vaccine

04:48:43.670 --> 04:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
04:48:45.910 --> 04:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
because of some underlying health things
 
04:48:47.590 --> 04:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
that she had
 
04:48:49.750 --> 04:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
had nothing to do with her heart
 
04:48:51.750 --> 04:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
had nothing to do with her respiratory
 
04:48:51.760 --> 04:48:53.270 align:start position:0%
had nothing to do with her respiratory
system

04:48:53.270 --> 04:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:48:55.750 --> 04:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
it was how she reacted
 
04:48:57.750 --> 04:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
to medic medication
 
04:49:00.788 --> 04:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
and other issues
 
04:49:02.948 --> 04:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
no one would give her a medical
 
04:49:02.958 --> 04:49:05.430 align:start position:0%
no one would give her a medical
exemption

04:49:05.430 --> 04:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
04:49:08.550 --> 04:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
we put it off as long as we could
 
04:49:13.510 --> 04:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
we waited until the last possible day
 
04:49:15.350 --> 04:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
on august 4th
 
04:49:16.708 --> 04:49:16.718 align:start position:0%
last year
 
04:49:18.150 --> 04:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
we gave in
 
04:49:24.390 --> 04:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:26.550 --> 04:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
a few hours later she was admitted to
 
04:49:29.190 --> 04:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
the emergency room and that night i see
 
04:49:29.200 --> 04:49:30.868 align:start position:0%
the emergency room and that night i see
you

04:49:30.868 --> 04:49:30.878 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:49:33.270 --> 04:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
her resting heart rate her ekg was
 
04:49:33.280 --> 04:49:35.110 align:start position:0%
her resting heart rate her ekg was
abnormal

04:49:35.110 --> 04:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
abnormal
 
04:49:39.910 --> 04:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:42.150 --> 04:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
to put that in perspective for those of
 
04:49:43.910 --> 04:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
you who don't know what a typical
 
04:49:46.708 --> 04:49:46.718 align:start position:0%
healthy competitive athlete's resting
 
04:49:49.270 --> 04:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
heart rate might be
 
04:49:55.510 --> 04:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:56.948 --> 04:49:56.958 align:start position:0%

after she was admitted to the er she
 
04:50:09.510 --> 04:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
said to me
 
04:50:13.350 --> 04:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:16.150 --> 04:50:16.160 align:start position:0%

i
 
04:50:26.070 --> 04:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
will never forgive myself
 
04:50:29.590 --> 04:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
for giving in to the college's mandate
 
04:50:33.750 --> 04:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
and letting her get that vaccine
 
04:50:35.590 --> 04:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
now understand
 
04:50:38.708 --> 04:50:38.718 align:start position:0%
we tried we talked with physicians we
 
04:50:40.550 --> 04:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
talked with people
 
04:50:42.708 --> 04:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
no one felt she should get a medical
 
04:50:42.718 --> 04:50:44.948 align:start position:0%
no one felt she should get a medical
exemption

04:50:44.948 --> 04:50:44.958 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
04:50:47.430 --> 04:50:47.440 align:start position:0%

if you would please so
 
04:50:54.708 --> 04:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
one week before the vaccine my daughter
 
04:50:57.510 --> 04:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
went was a normal she went to a college
 
04:50:59.430 --> 04:50:59.440 align:start position:0%

late nights lots of laughs long days she
 
04:51:04.390 --> 04:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
had a lot of fun
 
04:51:04.400 --> 04:51:05.350 align:start position:0%
had a lot of fun
now

04:51:05.350 --> 04:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:51:08.070 --> 04:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
six months after her vaccine she's still
 
04:51:09.510 --> 04:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
on a medication
 
04:51:11.670 --> 04:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
to control her heart rate
 
04:51:14.150 --> 04:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
she takes a nap every day because she is
 
04:51:14.160 --> 04:51:15.990 align:start position:0%
she takes a nap every day because she is
exhausted

04:51:15.990 --> 04:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
exhausted
 
04:51:18.310 --> 04:51:18.320 align:start position:0%

04:51:20.310 --> 04:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
on healing
 
04:51:23.030 --> 04:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
to be very clear with all of you
 
04:51:24.788 --> 04:51:24.798 align:start position:0%
my daughter didn't have heart issues
 
04:51:28.150 --> 04:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
before she got the vaccine
 
04:51:30.470 --> 04:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
three minutes or two minutes isn't
 
04:51:32.470 --> 04:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
enough to let you guys know how our
 
04:51:33.990 --> 04:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
lives have been changed due to this
 
04:51:35.670 --> 04:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate
 
04:51:39.910 --> 04:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
and i beg each and every one of you
 
04:51:42.868 --> 04:51:42.878 align:start position:0%

so that no one else ever has to go
 
04:51:47.430 --> 04:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
through what our family has done the
 
04:51:47.440 --> 04:51:48.708 align:start position:0%
through what our family has done the
choice

04:51:48.708 --> 04:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
choice
 
04:51:50.708 --> 04:51:50.718 align:start position:0%
should be ours
 
04:51:54.868 --> 04:51:54.878 align:start position:0%
it should not be mandated by anybody
 
04:51:57.590 --> 04:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
to have this
 
04:52:01.510 --> 04:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
unknown unproven vaccine

the chair recognizes catherine smith and
 
04:52:16.230 --> 04:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:17.910 --> 04:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me speak um my
 
04:52:19.030 --> 04:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
name is catherine smith and i'm
 
04:52:20.948 --> 04:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
inhabited of chichester and i'm also a
 
04:52:22.470 --> 04:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
registered nurse and i have a bachelor's
 
04:52:24.868 --> 04:52:24.878 align:start position:0%
in science in nursing and i speak in
 
04:52:28.070 --> 04:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
regards to house bill 1633 and by my
 
04:52:29.590 --> 04:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
statement it is known that i oppose the
 
04:52:32.550 --> 04:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate for school attendance
 
04:52:34.150 --> 04:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
my objection is based on the knowledge
 
04:52:35.910 --> 04:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
that pfizer is on record for fighting
 
04:52:38.070 --> 04:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
the release of the vaccination data and
 
04:52:40.310 --> 04:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
research additionally the food and drug
 
04:52:41.830 --> 04:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
administration has asked the courts to
 
04:52:43.110 --> 04:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
further delay the release of the
 
04:52:45.190 --> 04:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
vaccination data
 
04:52:47.190 --> 04:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
this is what i was going to say but in
 
04:52:49.430 --> 04:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
conversation with someone this this
 
04:52:51.030 --> 04:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
information that i wrote this morning
 
04:52:52.550 --> 04:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
based on a recent article is already
 
04:52:52.560 --> 04:52:53.910 align:start position:0%
based on a recent article is already
obsolete

04:52:53.910 --> 04:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
obsolete
 
04:52:56.070 --> 04:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
and one of the things i'd like to
 
04:52:58.628 --> 04:52:58.638 align:start position:0%
express you is a nurse who just got her
 
04:53:00.230 --> 04:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
nursing degree about two years ago i
 
04:53:02.470 --> 04:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time doing research and
 
04:53:05.110 --> 04:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
up-to-date data was really important
 
04:53:07.990 --> 04:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
and this vaccine and all the information
 
04:53:10.948 --> 04:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
about the covet is shifting sand
 
04:53:14.070 --> 04:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
and i think that if um
 
04:53:16.310 --> 04:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
people are quoting data and they're
 
04:53:18.230 --> 04:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
using current information they're going
 
04:53:19.990 --> 04:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
to very quickly find that that
 
04:53:22.150 --> 04:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
information is obsolete based on the
 
04:53:24.470 --> 04:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
nature of the what we're dealing with
 
04:53:26.948 --> 04:53:26.958 align:start position:0%
population changes
 
04:53:29.430 --> 04:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
so many variables and i just don't think
 
04:53:31.670 --> 04:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
that it's fair to for us to ask our
 
04:53:33.430 --> 04:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
children to do something that's going to
 
04:53:35.430 --> 04:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
permanently affect their lives when the
 
04:53:40.390 --> 04:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:42.070 --> 04:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
there's just there's there's nothing
 
04:53:44.470 --> 04:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
there's nothing solid to stand on i have
 
04:53:46.150 --> 04:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
tried to
 
04:53:48.708 --> 04:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
formulate an argument for and against
 
04:53:50.948 --> 04:53:50.958 align:start position:0%
because of the nature of my work as well
 
04:53:53.830 --> 04:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
as my social group i'm in the middle
 
04:53:56.470 --> 04:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
i can't i can't substantiate either way
 
04:53:59.110 --> 04:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
there's too much conflicting information
 
04:54:00.708 --> 04:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to say i think it's really
 
04:54:03.750 --> 04:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
important that if a person presents a
 
04:54:03.760 --> 04:54:04.628 align:start position:0%
important that if a person presents a
bill

04:54:04.628 --> 04:54:04.638 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:54:06.390 --> 04:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
then they should be sitting here
 
04:54:08.070 --> 04:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
listening to people
 
04:54:10.550 --> 04:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
and i'd i'd also like for mr is it mr
 
04:54:12.150 --> 04:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
morris he should be in this room and he
 
04:54:13.670 --> 04:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
should be hearing it it's shameful that
 
04:54:15.430 --> 04:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
he's not
 
04:54:17.350 --> 04:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
if you could if you could please keep to
 
04:54:19.190 --> 04:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
the topic of the bill and not the people
 
04:54:20.550 --> 04:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
and personalities would greatly
 
04:54:22.390 --> 04:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate it i will
 
04:54:22.400 --> 04:54:25.030 align:start position:0%
appreciate it i will
um

04:54:25.030 --> 04:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:27.270 --> 04:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
04:54:29.910 --> 04:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's in good conscious for us to ask
 
04:54:31.270 --> 04:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
ourselves how
 
04:54:33.910 --> 04:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
we can look our children in the eye and
 
04:54:33.920 --> 04:54:34.708 align:start position:0%
we can look our children in the eye and
say

04:54:34.708 --> 04:54:34.718 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:54:36.150 --> 04:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
we made a decision that could
 
04:54:38.550 --> 04:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
permanently alter their lives without
 
04:54:40.868 --> 04:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
good solid information
 
04:54:43.670 --> 04:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
we owe it to them to know
 
04:54:44.788 --> 04:54:44.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:54:47.430 --> 04:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:49.750 --> 04:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
now we have laura oh sorry
 
04:54:51.590 --> 04:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
i was shifting the cards we have linda
 
04:54:52.868 --> 04:54:52.878 align:start position:0%
mcgrath and
 
04:54:56.150 --> 04:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:02.470 --> 04:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:05.190 --> 04:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
hi i'm linda mcgrath i have been a

thank you for bringing him
 
04:55:18.948 --> 04:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
last year when
 
04:55:22.390 --> 04:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
i was mandated in my job to inject the
 
04:55:26.230 --> 04:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
kovid shot into children
 
04:55:29.830 --> 04:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:30.948 --> 04:55:30.958 align:start position:0%
and i
 
04:55:33.910 --> 04:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
could not do it in good conscience what
 
04:55:35.750 --> 04:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
everybody said here that we just don't
 
04:55:38.070 --> 04:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
know nobody here
 
04:55:43.910 --> 04:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:46.390 --> 04:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
is what we have to look at
 
04:55:50.150 --> 04:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
so the three things that i asked myself
 
04:55:50.160 --> 04:55:51.030 align:start position:0%
so the three things that i asked myself
is

04:55:51.030 --> 04:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:55:53.110 --> 04:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
number one do they need it
 
04:55:54.628 --> 04:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
the first year
 
04:55:58.310 --> 04:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
of covid before the vaccines in sweden
 
04:56:01.750 --> 04:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
no vaccines no lockdowns
 
04:56:04.708 --> 04:56:04.718 align:start position:0%
no social distancing no children's
 
04:56:04.718 --> 04:56:05.750 align:start position:0%
no social distancing no children's
deaths

04:56:05.750 --> 04:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
04:56:07.350 --> 04:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
they don't need it
 
04:56:10.708 --> 04:56:10.718 align:start position:0%
the second was does it work it certainly
 
04:56:12.470 --> 04:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't work the way they said it was
 
04:56:15.190 --> 04:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to work
 
04:56:17.750 --> 04:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
and there's information on both sides i
 
04:56:19.910 --> 04:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
truly i don't know what to believe and
 
04:56:23.110 --> 04:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
nobody here can know
 
04:56:26.070 --> 04:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:27.990 --> 04:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
i think is the most important question
 
04:56:29.990 --> 04:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
that we're all asking ourselves here
 
04:56:30.000 --> 04:56:30.948 align:start position:0%
that we're all asking ourselves here
today

04:56:30.948 --> 04:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:56:32.390 --> 04:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
and there's already been a lot of
 
04:56:35.030 --> 04:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
information on that so i can
 
04:56:38.070 --> 04:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
skip down to the part where i say i
 
04:56:40.070 --> 04:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
admit i don't know what to believe
 
04:56:41.510 --> 04:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
however the
 
04:56:43.910 --> 04:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
basic tenet of medicine which was stated
 
04:56:47.910 --> 04:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
here many times is first do no harm
 
04:56:50.788 --> 04:56:50.798 align:start position:0%
i find myself not trusting the science
 
04:56:53.350 --> 04:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
that is purported by the government
 
04:56:55.590 --> 04:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
and i started to question this when for
 
04:56:59.750 --> 04:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:02.470 --> 04:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
i was unable to dispense a prescription
 
04:57:05.110 --> 04:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
written by a doctor
 
04:57:07.510 --> 04:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
for an approved medication for an
 
04:57:10.150 --> 04:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
off-label use
 
04:57:12.390 --> 04:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
it didn't make any sense
 
04:57:14.470 --> 04:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
if you can just wrap it up thank you
 
04:57:15.510 --> 04:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
i will
 
04:57:17.910 --> 04:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
i will wrap it up with number one who
 
04:57:17.920 --> 04:57:19.430 align:start position:0%
i will wrap it up with number one who
profits

04:57:19.430 --> 04:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
profits
 
04:57:21.190 --> 04:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
big pharma
 
04:57:24.310 --> 04:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
is the clear winner do you trust them i
 
04:57:24.320 --> 04:57:26.070 align:start position:0%
is the clear winner do you trust them i
don't

04:57:26.070 --> 04:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:57:26.080 --> 04:57:27.590 align:start position:0%
don't
and

04:57:27.590 --> 04:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:57:30.628 --> 04:57:30.638 align:start position:0%
lastly i will say that
 
04:57:33.110 --> 04:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
i couldn't live with myself
 
04:57:35.430 --> 04:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
luckily i'm able to support myself
 
04:57:38.150 --> 04:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
without a job my kids are grown
 
04:57:40.470 --> 04:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
i don't have any bills
 
04:57:43.670 --> 04:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
i'm blessed to be able to forfeit my job
 
04:57:46.708 --> 04:57:46.718 align:start position:0%
so that i could sleep at night i made
 
04:57:49.190 --> 04:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
that decision for myself and i
 
04:57:52.230 --> 04:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
ask all of you to think about that
 
04:57:59.670 --> 04:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:01.830 --> 04:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
04:58:04.310 --> 04:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
we have laura condon up now and gary
 
04:58:06.470 --> 04:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
york is on deck
 
04:58:13.990 --> 04:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:16.310 --> 04:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
good afternoon i'm
 
04:58:16.320 --> 04:58:21.270 align:start position:0%
good afternoon i'm
good

04:58:21.270 --> 04:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:23.030 --> 04:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
hear me now
 
04:58:24.788 --> 04:58:24.798 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is laura condian
 
04:58:26.310 --> 04:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
i'm from bedford i'm the new hampshire
 
04:58:27.910 --> 04:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
director of advocacy with the national
 
04:58:29.590 --> 04:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine information center it's a
 
04:58:32.150 --> 04:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
volunteer position i oppose this bill
 
04:58:33.830 --> 04:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
that would mandate covered vaccines for
 
04:58:35.510 --> 04:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
children there are a few technical
 
04:58:37.590 --> 04:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
problems with the bill
 
04:58:39.590 --> 04:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
you'll note that
 
04:58:43.110 --> 04:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
it does call for
 
04:58:46.230 --> 04:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
this rsa to
 
04:58:46.240 --> 04:58:47.270 align:start position:0%
this rsa to
to

04:58:47.270 --> 04:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:58:50.070 --> 04:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
apply to all children who are residing
 
04:58:51.350 --> 04:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
04:58:53.350 --> 04:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
that is existing law and then if you go
 
04:58:54.628 --> 04:58:54.638 align:start position:0%
look at
 
04:58:56.788 --> 04:58:56.798 align:start position:0%
the definition of a child
 
04:58:58.948 --> 04:58:58.958 align:start position:0%
a child means any person between birth
 
04:59:00.628 --> 04:59:00.638 align:start position:0%
and age 18
 
04:59:03.590 --> 04:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
years of age redefining school and
 
04:59:06.230 --> 04:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
statute to include colleges
 
04:59:09.910 --> 04:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't redefine child so the cut off
 
04:59:11.990 --> 04:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
still is the vaccine requirements of the
 
04:59:14.470 --> 04:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
state the cutoff is still at age 18. so
 
04:59:17.350 --> 04:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
that's a technical glitch with this bill
 
04:59:18.868 --> 04:59:18.878 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:59:21.030 --> 04:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
unless somebody wants to redefine child
 
04:59:23.190 --> 04:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
to include those people over the age of
 
04:59:23.200 --> 04:59:24.470 align:start position:0%
to include those people over the age of
18.

04:59:24.470 --> 04:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
18.
 
04:59:25.750 --> 04:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
and i don't know what the limit they
 
04:59:28.150 --> 04:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
would put on it at that point
 
04:59:30.150 --> 04:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to repeal state law
 
04:59:31.830 --> 04:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
protecting natural essential and
 
04:59:33.910 --> 04:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
inherent rights
 
04:59:36.788 --> 04:59:36.798 align:start position:0%
that's quite honestly offensive
 
04:59:38.550 --> 04:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
we know that these coveted shots do not
 
04:59:41.430 --> 04:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
prevent infection do not prevent illness
 
04:59:42.788 --> 04:59:42.798 align:start position:0%
do not
 
04:59:45.030 --> 04:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
prevent spread and do not prevent death
 
04:59:47.590 --> 04:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
and this is per the manufacturers any
 
04:59:49.270 --> 04:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
representation these shots will prevent
 
04:59:52.788 --> 04:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
any of these things is misinformation
 
04:59:55.510 --> 04:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
the coveted shots are causing harm and
 
04:59:55.520 --> 04:59:56.470 align:start position:0%
the coveted shots are causing harm and
death

04:59:56.470 --> 04:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
death
 
04:59:59.270 --> 04:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
in fact deaths do occur
 
05:00:00.868 --> 05:00:00.878 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
05:00:03.030 --> 05:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
there have been this many deaths from
 
05:00:04.830 --> 05:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
covid that's
 
05:00:07.350 --> 05:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
zero here in new hampshire there have
 
05:00:10.550 --> 05:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
been reported two veers this many deaths
 
05:00:13.110 --> 05:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
child deaths due to the coveted vaccine
 
05:00:15.110 --> 05:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
that's two
 
05:00:17.430 --> 05:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
one of those individuals is a 15 year
 
05:00:18.470 --> 05:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
old girl
 
05:00:21.670 --> 05:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
the other one is a 15 year old boy
 
05:00:25.190 --> 05:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
from bedford we know him as charlie
 
05:00:25.200 --> 05:00:26.070 align:start position:0%
from bedford we know him as charlie
um

05:00:26.070 --> 05:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:29.430 --> 05:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
i ask that um
 
05:00:31.670 --> 05:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
that you find this bill without any
 
05:00:33.670 --> 05:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
significant basis to mandate these
 
05:00:35.830 --> 05:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines and you find this bill and
 
05:00:40.230 --> 05:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:43.670 --> 05:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we have dr gary york
 
05:00:43.680 --> 05:00:46.550 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we have dr gary york
and

05:00:46.550 --> 05:00:46.560 align:start position:0%

my name is gary york i'm from hopkinton
 
05:01:01.110 --> 05:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and
 
05:01:03.030 --> 05:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
i would like to
 
05:01:04.550 --> 05:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
present uh
 
05:01:07.190 --> 05:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
some reasons why this is
 
05:01:10.708 --> 05:01:10.718 align:start position:0%
itl thumbs down for this bill
 
05:01:12.948 --> 05:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
it's actually good news uh at least i
 
05:01:14.708 --> 05:01:14.718 align:start position:0%
see that it is
 
05:01:17.110 --> 05:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
i've come across some data from the cdc
 
05:01:19.510 --> 05:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
that did a study on the zero prevalence
 
05:01:19.520 --> 05:01:20.868 align:start position:0%
that did a study on the zero prevalence
of

05:01:20.868 --> 05:01:20.878 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:01:23.430 --> 05:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
antibodies against coed for the age
 
05:01:26.150 --> 05:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
group 5 to 11 years old
 
05:01:28.628 --> 05:01:28.638 align:start position:0%
in november december
 
05:01:28.638 --> 05:01:30.788 align:start position:0%
in november december
2020

05:01:30.788 --> 05:01:30.798 align:start position:0%
2020
 
05:01:30.798 --> 05:01:31.910 align:start position:0%
2020
that

05:01:31.910 --> 05:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:01:34.390 --> 05:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
zero prevalence was
 
05:01:37.510 --> 05:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
18 for the five to 11 year old
 
05:01:37.520 --> 05:01:39.110 align:start position:0%
18 for the five to 11 year old
group

05:01:39.110 --> 05:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
group
 
05:01:40.788 --> 05:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
six months later
 
05:01:42.310 --> 05:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
they report
 
05:01:46.230 --> 05:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:48.070 --> 05:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
reflective of
 
05:01:50.070 --> 05:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
exposure to the virus and forming
 
05:01:52.470 --> 05:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
antibodies and not necessarily being
 
05:01:53.910 --> 05:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
sick from the virus possibly
 
05:01:55.750 --> 05:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
asymptomatic but these are unhealthy
 
05:01:57.510 --> 05:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
children and the state is from
 
05:02:01.270 --> 05:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
laboratories from across the country
 
05:02:05.030 --> 05:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
so given that that was a large rise in
 
05:02:07.830 --> 05:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
zero prevalence for the antibody i would
 
05:02:09.510 --> 05:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
expect and i think it's reasonable to
 
05:02:12.868 --> 05:02:12.878 align:start position:0%
expect that eight months later that
 
05:02:12.878 --> 05:02:13.750 align:start position:0%
expect that eight months later that
fully

05:02:13.750 --> 05:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
fully
 
05:02:16.470 --> 05:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
more than half of kids five to 11 have
 
05:02:18.948 --> 05:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
natural antibodies through exposure at
 
05:02:22.150 --> 05:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
school parents whatever
 
05:02:24.830 --> 05:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
and that's a pretty high
 
05:02:27.110 --> 05:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
percentage and now historically if we
 
05:02:29.110 --> 05:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
look at flu vaccines and if we consider
 
05:02:31.910 --> 05:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
the omicron variant which is a very mild
 
05:02:34.628 --> 05:02:34.638 align:start position:0%
flu-like illness
 
05:02:34.638 --> 05:02:35.910 align:start position:0%
flu-like illness
historically

05:02:35.910 --> 05:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
historically
 
05:02:40.868 --> 05:02:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:44.230 --> 05:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
anticipate what the what the flu vaccine
 
05:02:46.948 --> 05:02:46.958 align:start position:0%
will be for the upcoming years
 
05:02:49.830 --> 05:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
and typically it's it's less than 50
 
05:02:49.840 --> 05:02:51.030 align:start position:0%
and typically it's it's less than 50
percent

05:02:51.030 --> 05:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:02:51.040 --> 05:02:53.110 align:start position:0%
percent
efficacious

05:02:53.110 --> 05:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
efficacious
 
05:02:55.990 --> 05:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
so i think what we're dealing here is uh
 
05:02:58.470 --> 05:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
the good news is that children
 
05:02:58.480 --> 05:03:00.230 align:start position:0%
the good news is that children
already

05:03:00.230 --> 05:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
already
 
05:03:01.830 --> 05:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
inherently have
 
05:03:04.070 --> 05:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
antibody resistance to this
 
05:03:05.910 --> 05:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
and i think they should be exposed to a
 
05:03:07.590 --> 05:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
mild disease we should all be exposed to
 
05:03:09.830 --> 05:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
a mild disease give us all a chance to
 
05:03:12.310 --> 05:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
form natural antibodies to this
 
05:03:12.320 --> 05:03:13.350 align:start position:0%
form natural antibodies to this
mild

05:03:13.350 --> 05:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
mild
 
05:03:16.070 --> 05:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
variant of covid thank you
 
05:03:18.948 --> 05:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:03:20.628 --> 05:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
next i call representative melissa
 
05:03:24.788 --> 05:03:24.798 align:start position:0%
blazek and julie smith is on deck
 
05:03:28.470 --> 05:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:30.550 --> 05:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
i know
 
05:03:31.910 --> 05:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
05:03:34.070 --> 05:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
committee for the record i am melissa
 
05:03:36.708 --> 05:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
blasic and i represent hillsborough 21
 
05:03:38.868 --> 05:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
that seat is not done to intimidate i
 
05:03:40.788 --> 05:03:40.798 align:start position:0%
sat there earlier this morning and i
 
05:03:42.868 --> 05:03:42.878 align:start position:0%
realized how people could think that's
 
05:03:45.510 --> 05:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
not our intent
 
05:03:47.590 --> 05:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
um okay i'll keep this brief um i just
 
05:03:49.750 --> 05:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
want to quickly point out if i'm reading
 
05:03:52.070 --> 05:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
the bill correctly that not only does
 
05:03:54.150 --> 05:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
this bill mandate the covid vaccine for
 
05:03:57.110 --> 05:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
k-12 but post-secondary schools as well
 
05:03:58.788 --> 05:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
and it seems to
 
05:04:01.350 --> 05:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
also mandate the entire k-12 vaccine
 
05:04:03.830 --> 05:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
schedule for post-secondary schools that
 
05:04:05.590 --> 05:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
means that all public and private
 
05:04:07.670 --> 05:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities will have a
 
05:04:10.470 --> 05:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
full schedule of mandated vaccines this
 
05:04:12.948 --> 05:04:12.958 align:start position:0%
is incredibly unusual i could not find
 
05:04:16.070 --> 05:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
evidence of a single state that
 
05:04:18.070 --> 05:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
mandates all of their k through 12
 
05:04:20.788 --> 05:04:20.798 align:start position:0%
vaccines for post-secondary schools
 
05:04:20.798 --> 05:04:22.390 align:start position:0%
vaccines for post-secondary schools
um

05:04:22.390 --> 05:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:25.430 --> 05:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
to be clear no state has mandated the
 
05:04:27.910 --> 05:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
covit 19 vaccine for post-secondary
 
05:04:30.470 --> 05:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
education none and to clarify the
 
05:04:31.830 --> 05:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
question that was
 
05:04:34.070 --> 05:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
asked of representative marsh before yes
 
05:04:36.310 --> 05:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
this does apply to private schools as
 
05:04:38.310 --> 05:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
well as public schools
 
05:04:39.910 --> 05:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
i think the reason why this bill has
 
05:04:41.670 --> 05:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
received so much attention is because
 
05:04:44.310 --> 05:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
people are shocked by the audacity to
 
05:04:46.550 --> 05:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
suggest to mandate this vaccine which is
 
05:04:48.390 --> 05:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
still emergency use authorized for
 
05:04:51.510 --> 05:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
children it seems incredibly premature a
 
05:04:53.350 --> 05:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
healthy child is not at a statistical
 
05:04:55.430 --> 05:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
risk from covid a child is at more
 
05:04:57.270 --> 05:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
statistical risk from influenza or
 
05:04:57.280 --> 05:04:58.708 align:start position:0%
statistical risk from influenza or
drowning

05:04:58.708 --> 05:04:58.718 align:start position:0%
drowning
 
05:05:00.230 --> 05:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
lastly i would like to point out that a
 
05:05:02.470 --> 05:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
basic tenet of our society is that we do
 
05:05:04.470 --> 05:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
not place burdens upon children to
 
05:05:05.990 --> 05:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
protect adults
 
05:05:08.470 --> 05:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
over the last two years we have severely
 
05:05:11.190 --> 05:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
lost sight of this philosophy and as a
 
05:05:13.190 --> 05:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
result we have damaged a generation
 
05:05:16.230 --> 05:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
physically emotionally and academically
 
05:05:18.390 --> 05:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
as a society we need to reverse course
 
05:05:23.350 --> 05:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:25.190 --> 05:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:05:27.510 --> 05:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
next up we have julie smith and on deck
 
05:05:31.670 --> 05:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:33.270 --> 05:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
i think they're pretty much
 
05:05:35.830 --> 05:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
the same we have problem solvers thank
 
05:05:39.430 --> 05:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
you so much for doing that
 
05:05:41.190 --> 05:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon committee members julie
 
05:05:44.230 --> 05:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
smith from nashua in opposition
 
05:05:45.910 --> 05:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
first let me say kudos to all the
 
05:05:48.150 --> 05:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
parents who made sacrifices to be here
 
05:05:50.390 --> 05:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
today to make their objections known
 
05:05:52.310 --> 05:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
using their vacation time gowns of
 
05:05:54.550 --> 05:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
expensive gas finding a sitter and or
 
05:05:55.910 --> 05:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
spending hours at the wheel with
 
05:05:59.430 --> 05:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
rambunctious kids did not go unnoticed
 
05:06:01.750 --> 05:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
i'm here today for them and for those
 
05:06:04.070 --> 05:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
absent who wanted to be here i am here
 
05:06:05.830 --> 05:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
as a taxpayer to object to the
 
05:06:07.830 --> 05:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
government trampling on their parental
 
05:06:10.470 --> 05:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
rights this blatant overreach is denying
 
05:06:12.310 --> 05:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
them access to the schools that i am
 
05:06:14.550 --> 05:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
forced to pay for as someone without
 
05:06:17.270 --> 05:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
kids i don't get to opt out of paying i
 
05:06:19.190 --> 05:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
expect the enemy talking points to
 
05:06:19.200 --> 05:06:20.470 align:start position:0%
expect the enemy talking points to
include

05:06:20.470 --> 05:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
include
 
05:06:22.788 --> 05:06:22.798 align:start position:0%
suggested use of the newly minted
 
05:06:25.990 --> 05:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
education freedom accounts to them i ask
 
05:06:28.390 --> 05:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
how many of you also are actively trying
 
05:06:31.910 --> 05:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
to undo them talk about hypocrisy
 
05:06:33.510 --> 05:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
and let's look at the front man of all
 
05:06:35.670 --> 05:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
the sponsors an eye doctor who sits on
 
05:06:40.708 --> 05:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:42.628 --> 05:06:42.638 align:start position:0%
we're getting into personalities you
 
05:06:45.430 --> 05:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
will confine your remarks to the issues
 
05:06:45.440 --> 05:06:46.628 align:start position:0%
will confine your remarks to the issues
only

05:06:46.628 --> 05:06:46.638 align:start position:0%
only
 
05:06:49.350 --> 05:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
okay i'd like to reclaim my time please
 
05:06:53.030 --> 05:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
as well we will decide that now you read
 
05:06:55.750 --> 05:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
you read this and be finished please
 
05:06:58.070 --> 05:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
as frank our devoted commissioner said
 
05:06:59.670 --> 05:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
parents are the bottom line people
 
05:07:01.910 --> 05:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
responsible for supervising their
 
05:07:04.310 --> 05:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
education of their kids if they choose
 
05:07:07.110 --> 05:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
to utilize the school in their zip codes
 
05:07:09.190 --> 05:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
involuntarily funded by their fellow
 
05:07:11.510 --> 05:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers such as myself they are still
 
05:07:14.788 --> 05:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
free market consumers
 
05:07:14.798 --> 05:07:15.590 align:start position:0%
free market consumers
and

05:07:15.590 --> 05:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:07:19.190 --> 05:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
as my senator presented his bill on
 
05:07:21.590 --> 05:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
january 13th the correct bill to support
 
05:07:21.600 --> 05:07:23.110 align:start position:0%
january 13th the correct bill to support
sb288

05:07:23.110 --> 05:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
sb288
 
05:07:25.270 --> 05:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
parents have the right to decide
 
05:07:28.070 --> 05:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
if their kids are vaccinated or not
 
05:07:30.070 --> 05:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to finish by saying that
 
05:07:32.550 --> 05:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
the testimony of the woman in the cobalt
 
05:07:36.470 --> 05:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
blue blazer actually broke my heart
 
05:07:38.708 --> 05:07:38.718 align:start position:0%
shame on the sponsor
 
05:07:40.310 --> 05:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
and every
 
05:07:43.110 --> 05:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
doctor in our legislature please kill
 
05:07:55.910 --> 05:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:58.628 --> 05:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
and on deck is ed groves and remember no
 
05:08:00.310 --> 05:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
personal attacks please this is about
 
05:08:01.830 --> 05:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
the issues and not about the people
 
05:08:09.110 --> 05:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:12.070 --> 05:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
i think she left we have ed groves and
 
05:08:17.750 --> 05:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:19.190 --> 05:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:08:19.200 --> 05:08:20.230 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

05:08:20.230 --> 05:08:20.240 align:start position:0%

05:08:22.310 --> 05:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
nice to see you guys again so yes my
 
05:08:24.310 --> 05:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
name is ed groves i've been to a number
 
05:08:26.868 --> 05:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
of these hearings uh over the past few
 
05:08:26.878 --> 05:08:27.830 align:start position:0%
of these hearings uh over the past few
weeks

05:08:27.830 --> 05:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
05:08:29.590 --> 05:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
i like to call them freedom fighter
 
05:08:29.600 --> 05:08:30.788 align:start position:0%
i like to call them freedom fighter
hearings

05:08:30.788 --> 05:08:30.798 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
05:08:32.310 --> 05:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
getting rid of mandates getting rid of
 
05:08:32.320 --> 05:08:33.430 align:start position:0%
getting rid of mandates getting rid of
masks

05:08:33.430 --> 05:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
masks
 
05:08:35.510 --> 05:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
but there's been a common theme on both
 
05:08:39.030 --> 05:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
sides and i've heard it here today from
 
05:08:42.470 --> 05:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
the professional testimony on both sides
 
05:08:44.708 --> 05:08:44.718 align:start position:0%
we have actually been using our children
 
05:08:46.788 --> 05:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
as guinea pigs lab rats whatever you
 
05:08:48.708 --> 05:08:48.718 align:start position:0%
want to call it for the last two plus
 
05:08:51.910 --> 05:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
years and this just has to stop
 
05:08:54.070 --> 05:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
the damage we've already seen about the
 
05:08:55.750 --> 05:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
suicide rates i was in a hearing
 
05:08:57.190 --> 05:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
yesterday and there was a doctor in
 
05:08:57.200 --> 05:08:58.310 align:start position:0%
yesterday and there was a doctor in
there

05:08:58.310 --> 05:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:08:58.320 --> 05:08:59.190 align:start position:0%
there
there's

05:08:59.190 --> 05:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
there's
 
05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
there's already stats what do you think
 
05:09:02.390 --> 05:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
these stats are going to be in five

school advocate she was a senior
 
05:09:27.590 --> 05:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
pushing her literally telling her hey

courtney you might as well get
 
05:09:30.070 --> 05:09:30.080 align:start position:0%

05:09:32.470 --> 05:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
for graduation that's just wrong that
 
05:09:33.670 --> 05:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
was what the whole hearing was about

yesterday
 
05:09:37.590 --> 05:09:37.600 align:start position:0%

05:09:47.350 --> 05:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
think about that senior year in high
 
05:09:48.628 --> 05:09:48.638 align:start position:0%
school is one of my greatest years of my
 
05:09:50.708 --> 05:09:50.718 align:start position:0%
life and i'm 58 years old and i remember
 
05:09:53.030 --> 05:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
my whole the point is we've done enough
 
05:09:55.190 --> 05:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
damage to our children we we've got to
 
05:09:57.110 --> 05:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
let them be free we got to get rid of
 
05:09:58.310 --> 05:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
the masks we got to get rid of the
 
05:09:59.990 --> 05:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
mandates we got to get rid of this
 
05:10:01.830 --> 05:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
experimental drug and there's one way to
 
05:10:03.830 --> 05:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
do it and you guys have the power to do
 
05:10:03.840 --> 05:10:04.788 align:start position:0%
do it and you guys have the power to do
it

05:10:04.788 --> 05:10:04.798 align:start position:0%

ivor mektin i took it it works
 
05:10:12.150 --> 05:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
there's so many studies i know we're not
 
05:10:13.670 --> 05:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
here to talk about that
 
05:10:15.350 --> 05:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
but please
 
05:10:18.628 --> 05:10:18.638 align:start position:0%
please do your research on that
 
05:10:21.430 --> 05:10:21.440 align:start position:0%

05:10:31.750 --> 05:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you
 
05:10:33.430 --> 05:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
everybody um
 
05:10:34.948 --> 05:10:34.958 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna go in a little different
 
05:10:34.958 --> 05:10:36.868 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna go in a little different
direction

05:10:36.868 --> 05:10:36.878 align:start position:0%
direction
 
05:10:40.628 --> 05:10:40.638 align:start position:0%
human beings realize truth
 
05:10:43.510 --> 05:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
as empirical or scientific
 
05:10:45.190 --> 05:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
05:10:47.270 --> 05:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
fear always drives the one they choose
 
05:10:47.280 --> 05:10:49.110 align:start position:0%
fear always drives the one they choose
first

05:10:49.110 --> 05:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
first
 
05:10:51.830 --> 05:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
science as defined begins as an educated
 
05:10:51.840 --> 05:10:52.868 align:start position:0%
science as defined begins as an educated
guess

05:10:52.868 --> 05:10:52.878 align:start position:0%
guess
 
05:10:54.868 --> 05:10:54.878 align:start position:0%
throughout history science initial
 
05:10:57.670 --> 05:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
initials premise has proven wrong more
 
05:10:59.190 --> 05:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
than right
 
05:11:01.430 --> 05:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
from the world is flat to now covert
 
05:11:05.510 --> 05:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
mandate this now covert mundane hearing
 
05:11:08.788 --> 05:11:08.798 align:start position:0%
science driven by fear leads to mistrust
 
05:11:10.910 --> 05:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
and this is the most dangerous
 
05:11:13.270 --> 05:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
miscalculation of all
 
05:11:13.280 --> 05:11:14.230 align:start position:0%
miscalculation of all
why

05:11:14.230 --> 05:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
why
 
05:11:17.110 --> 05:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
because trust is like a soap bubble
 
05:11:18.788 --> 05:11:18.798 align:start position:0%
and once it's gone it never really
 
05:11:18.798 --> 05:11:20.550 align:start position:0%
and once it's gone it never really
returns

05:11:20.550 --> 05:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
returns
 
05:11:22.628 --> 05:11:22.638 align:start position:0%
we are all well beyond the point the
 
05:11:24.948 --> 05:11:24.958 align:start position:0%
tipping point regardless of blame
 
05:11:26.628 --> 05:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
it's too late
 
05:11:28.550 --> 05:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
so i share with you a line from the
 
05:11:31.190 --> 05:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
bible that makes my point
 
05:11:33.670 --> 05:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
give unto caesar what is caesar's
 
05:11:36.150 --> 05:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
and give to god what is god's
 
05:11:37.830 --> 05:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
in today's words
 
05:11:39.750 --> 05:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
give unto the politicians what is the
 
05:11:39.760 --> 05:11:41.110 align:start position:0%
give unto the politicians what is the
politicians

05:11:41.110 --> 05:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
politicians
 
05:11:43.350 --> 05:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
and give unto the parents their children
 
05:11:43.360 --> 05:11:45.510 align:start position:0%
and give unto the parents their children
back

05:11:45.510 --> 05:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
back
 
05:11:49.430 --> 05:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
when a politician or doctor takes
 
05:11:51.590 --> 05:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
what is god's
 
05:11:55.270 --> 05:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
then it is called totalitarianism
 
05:11:57.750 --> 05:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
i ask you to be bold
 
05:11:59.750 --> 05:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
do what is inherently human and right
 
05:12:01.430 --> 05:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know this
 
05:12:05.110 --> 05:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
please don't be the person or the party
 
05:12:08.150 --> 05:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
just to to break this bubble this trust
 
05:12:09.510 --> 05:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
is in
 
05:12:12.070 --> 05:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
it's in our it's everything about us
 
05:12:14.470 --> 05:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
don't break this trust
 
05:12:17.030 --> 05:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
please do not support this bill
 
05:12:20.230 --> 05:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:21.670 --> 05:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much

i call amon amanda mastriani to the to

05:12:33.030 --> 05:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:12:34.708 --> 05:12:34.718 align:start position:0%
the woman who gave her testimony about
 
05:12:39.510 --> 05:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:41.110 --> 05:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
05:12:44.788 --> 05:12:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:47.430 --> 05:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
she's a great example of how
 
05:12:50.390 --> 05:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
moms know best of course that's not true
 
05:12:53.190 --> 05:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
with every mom but it is true with many
 
05:12:53.200 --> 05:12:54.708 align:start position:0%
with every mom but it is true with many
moms

05:12:54.708 --> 05:12:54.718 align:start position:0%
moms
 
05:12:56.628 --> 05:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
that mom knew better than those doctors
 
05:12:57.910 --> 05:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
who wouldn't give her a medical
 
05:12:57.920 --> 05:13:00.948 align:start position:0%
who wouldn't give her a medical
exemption

05:13:00.948 --> 05:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:02.708 --> 05:13:02.718 align:start position:0%
i'd also like to say thank you to dr
 
05:13:05.030 --> 05:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
farella i echo much of what she said in
 
05:13:07.510 --> 05:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
her testimony
 
05:13:09.270 --> 05:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
i'd like to share what's known as the
 
05:13:11.190 --> 05:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
physicians declaration
 
05:13:12.708 --> 05:13:12.718 align:start position:0%

january 18th
 
05:13:21.030 --> 05:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
over 17 000 doctors and scientists have
 
05:13:24.230 --> 05:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
signed this declaration
 
05:13:26.070 --> 05:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
we the physicians of the world united
 
05:13:27.990 --> 05:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
and loyal to the hippocratic oath
 
05:13:29.750 --> 05:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
recognizing the imminent threat to
 
05:13:31.510 --> 05:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
humanity brought forth by current
 
05:13:33.750 --> 05:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
covenanting policies are compelled to
 
05:13:35.750 --> 05:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
declare the following
 
05:13:38.150 --> 05:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
whereas after 20 months of research
 
05:13:40.150 --> 05:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
millions of patients treated hundreds of
 
05:13:42.230 --> 05:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
clinical trials performed
 
05:13:44.470 --> 05:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
and scientific data shared we have

demonstrated and documented our success
 
05:13:49.670 --> 05:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
and understanding in combating covid19
 
05:13:52.070 --> 05:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
whereas in consideration of the risks
 
05:13:53.590 --> 05:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
versus benefits
 
05:13:56.310 --> 05:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
of major policy decisions thousands of
 
05:13:58.150 --> 05:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
physicians and medical scientists
 
05:14:00.948 --> 05:14:00.958 align:start position:0%
worldwide have reached consensus on
 
05:14:04.310 --> 05:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
three foundational principles
 
05:14:05.910 --> 05:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
i'm only going to mention the principles
 
05:14:07.270 --> 05:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to get into each one
 
05:14:09.990 --> 05:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
because i probably won't have time
 
05:14:11.750 --> 05:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
the first principle is that healthy
 
05:14:14.230 --> 05:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
children shall not be subject to forced
 
05:14:14.240 --> 05:14:16.070 align:start position:0%
children shall not be subject to forced
vaccination

05:14:16.070 --> 05:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
05:14:18.230 --> 05:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
principle number two
 
05:14:20.948 --> 05:14:20.958 align:start position:0%
that natural immunity
 
05:14:22.788 --> 05:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
people with natural immunity recovered
 
05:14:25.670 --> 05:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
from sars cov2 shall not be subject to
 
05:14:29.030 --> 05:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
any restrictions or vaccine mandates
 
05:14:29.040 --> 05:14:30.230 align:start position:0%
any restrictions or vaccine mandates
three

05:14:30.230 --> 05:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:14:32.150 --> 05:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
that all healthy
 
05:14:34.628 --> 05:14:34.638 align:start position:0%
agencies and institutions sell cease
 
05:14:37.110 --> 05:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
interfering with physicians treating
 
05:14:39.990 --> 05:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
individual patients
 
05:14:43.750 --> 05:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
this was signed by over 17 000 doctors
 
05:14:43.760 --> 05:14:47.590 align:start position:0%
this was signed by over 17 000 doctors
worldwide

05:14:47.590 --> 05:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:49.670 --> 05:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:14:51.590 --> 05:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
oh and i've sent all the substantiating
 
05:14:53.670 --> 05:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
evidence to this entire committee via
 
05:14:53.680 --> 05:14:57.590 align:start position:0%
evidence to this entire committee via
email

05:14:57.590 --> 05:14:57.600 align:start position:0%

05:15:02.550 --> 05:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
last night i believe around
 
05:15:04.150 --> 05:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
10 p.m

lymphoma um stage four um just all of a
sudden

05:16:11.190 --> 05:16:11.200 align:start position:0%
sudden
 
05:16:13.910 --> 05:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
i think that um i can't prove that it
 
05:16:15.510 --> 05:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
was from the vaccines of course i can't
 
05:16:16.868 --> 05:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
prove that but
 
05:16:18.868 --> 05:16:18.878 align:start position:0%
tom renz the lawyer said that there's
 
05:16:21.430 --> 05:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
been a significant
 
05:16:23.350 --> 05:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
percent higher percentage of people who
 
05:16:25.270 --> 05:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
are getting cancer
 
05:16:27.270 --> 05:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
from this vaccine
 
05:16:27.280 --> 05:16:28.070 align:start position:0%
from this vaccine
and

05:16:28.070 --> 05:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:16:30.230 --> 05:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
there's just no that the risks
 
05:16:33.270 --> 05:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
completely outweigh the benefits and i
 
05:16:35.270 --> 05:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
just urge you to
 
05:16:37.910 --> 05:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
look into your heart and
 
05:16:40.470 --> 05:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
ask yourself do you want your kids
 
05:16:43.750 --> 05:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
to be harmed by a vaccine
 
05:16:45.750 --> 05:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
your grandkids
 
05:16:48.708 --> 05:16:48.718 align:start position:0%

the kids
 
05:16:54.708 --> 05:16:54.718 align:start position:0%

05:17:20.948 --> 05:17:20.958 align:start position:0%
so my testimony has changed now because
 
05:17:23.910 --> 05:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
of a wonderful doctor that spoke into so
 
05:17:25.190 --> 05:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
many of the points that we wanted to
 
05:17:25.200 --> 05:17:27.110 align:start position:0%
many of the points that we wanted to
give

05:17:27.110 --> 05:17:27.120 align:start position:0%

05:17:29.270 --> 05:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
my heart goes out to the woman and her
 
05:17:29.280 --> 05:17:30.310 align:start position:0%
my heart goes out to the woman and her
daughter

05:17:30.310 --> 05:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
daughter
 
05:17:31.990 --> 05:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
that injury
 
05:17:33.670 --> 05:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
broke our heart
 
05:17:35.590 --> 05:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
so i'm actually the person that wrote
 
05:17:37.110 --> 05:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
the article
 
05:17:38.868 --> 05:17:38.878 align:start position:0%

adverse event reporting system
 
05:17:59.270 --> 05:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
this is how i started the story
 
05:18:00.788 --> 05:18:00.798 align:start position:0%
when i heard of this extremely
 
05:18:02.948 --> 05:18:02.958 align:start position:0%

i was surprised and saddened
 
05:18:14.150 --> 05:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
the obituary clearly articulated the
 
05:18:17.030 --> 05:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
short but amazing life charlie had
 
05:18:18.868 --> 05:18:18.878 align:start position:0%
after reading almost every news story
 
05:18:20.310 --> 05:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
published to understand what happened to
 
05:18:22.470 --> 05:18:22.480 align:start position:0%

05:18:24.948 --> 05:18:24.958 align:start position:0%
handsome young man i along with several

other granite staters some who know this

grieving family personally
 
05:18:31.750 --> 05:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
realized something didn't add up
 
05:18:33.430 --> 05:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
there were many logical question
 
05:18:35.350 --> 05:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
questions surrounding his death why
 
05:18:37.190 --> 05:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
would a healthy teenager who was a good
 
05:18:39.510 --> 05:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
swimmer who used this rope swing on
 
05:18:42.310 --> 05:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
dozens of occasions at the same pond
 
05:18:44.150 --> 05:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
suddenly forget how to swim and die from
 
05:18:44.160 --> 05:18:45.350 align:start position:0%
suddenly forget how to swim and die from
drowning

05:18:45.350 --> 05:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
drowning
 
05:18:46.948 --> 05:18:46.958 align:start position:0%
did he hit his head
 
05:18:49.190 --> 05:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
did he accidentally knock himself out
 
05:18:51.110 --> 05:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
what really happened that day
 
05:18:53.030 --> 05:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
many great granite staters are very
 
05:18:55.830 --> 05:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
confused and very concerned thank god
 
05:18:59.190 --> 05:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
the family had an autopsy
 
05:19:01.670 --> 05:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
there is no doubt that charlie's inc was
 
05:19:03.470 --> 05:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
ver's id
 
05:19:06.310 --> 05:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
176-4974 there is little question from
 
05:19:08.230 --> 05:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
the autopsy results that charlie
 
05:19:10.550 --> 05:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
suffered from an acute heart injury at
 
05:19:12.070 --> 05:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
the time of his death
 
05:19:14.470 --> 05:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
it is well known by medical experts that
 
05:19:17.110 --> 05:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
one relatively common sign of cardiac
 
05:19:19.830 --> 05:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
injury displays as unilateral shoulder
 
05:19:22.470 --> 05:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
pain when charlie surfaced after he hit
 
05:19:24.230 --> 05:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
the water he said wow
 
05:19:25.430 --> 05:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
that hurt
 
05:19:27.510 --> 05:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
he always went underwater to swim to the
 
05:19:27.520 --> 05:19:28.788 align:start position:0%
he always went underwater to swim to the
door

05:19:28.788 --> 05:19:28.798 align:start position:0%
door
 
05:19:31.110 --> 05:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
one can conclude that
 
05:19:32.310 --> 05:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
he could have been referring to the
 
05:19:35.190 --> 05:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
cardiac injury myocarditis myocardial
 
05:19:37.430 --> 05:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
infraction etc while hitting the water
 
05:19:39.910 --> 05:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
or sometime around that event
 
05:19:42.550 --> 05:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
i know i only have two minutes i do want
 
05:19:45.190 --> 05:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
to say a couple things
 
05:19:47.510 --> 05:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
the vaccines are the one okay i
 
05:19:49.030 --> 05:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
05:19:49.040 --> 05:19:50.390 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
um

05:19:50.390 --> 05:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:52.390 --> 05:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
the vaccines and that's the only time
 
05:19:54.230 --> 05:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say this here because it is
 
05:19:57.270 --> 05:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
not a vaccine it is an experimental
 
05:19:59.990 --> 05:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
gene therapy injection those are the
 
05:20:02.230 --> 05:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
variants that is why the children in the
 
05:20:04.390 --> 05:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
school from the nurses association those
 
05:20:04.400 --> 05:20:05.830 align:start position:0%
school from the nurses association those
440

05:20:05.830 --> 05:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
440
 
05:20:07.350 --> 05:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
the reason why these kids are sick right
 
05:20:09.430 --> 05:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
now and are testing positive is because
 
05:20:11.350 --> 05:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
you just injected them all
 
05:20:13.510 --> 05:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
let's be clear on that
 
05:20:14.948 --> 05:20:14.958 align:start position:0%
and i know we're not supposed to say any
 
05:20:14.958 --> 05:20:16.310 align:start position:0%
and i know we're not supposed to say any
names

05:20:16.310 --> 05:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
names
 
05:20:19.350 --> 05:20:19.360 align:start position:0%

05:21:32.708 --> 05:21:32.718 align:start position:0%
my grandson now who's 11 years old has
 
05:21:36.150 --> 05:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
panic attacks he was a healthy boy

05:21:39.760 --> 05:21:40.628 align:start position:0%
until all these stupid restrictions
um

05:21:40.628 --> 05:21:40.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:43.350 --> 05:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
that they're not even getting sick my
 
05:21:46.070 --> 05:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
daughter took him to the doctors did all
 
05:21:47.990 --> 05:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
that he can't breathe his heart
 
05:21:51.030 --> 05:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
everything and they said no he has panic
 
05:21:52.788 --> 05:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
attacks now
 
05:21:55.270 --> 05:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
and the doctor said he's not alone i'm
 
05:21:57.750 --> 05:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
seeing lots of kids come in
 
05:21:59.430 --> 05:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
with panic attacks
 
05:22:01.670 --> 05:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing lots of kids she said the
 
05:22:04.150 --> 05:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
suicide rate of the children has gone
 
05:22:06.548 --> 05:22:06.558 align:start position:0%
skyrocket depression
 
05:22:06.558 --> 05:22:07.910 align:start position:0%
skyrocket depression
um

05:22:07.910 --> 05:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:10.070 --> 05:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
what we're doing to our children i just
 
05:22:12.390 --> 05:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
cannot believe that
 
05:22:14.390 --> 05:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
people want to inject them with this
 
05:22:17.430 --> 05:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
this vaccine and i have a grandson my
 
05:22:20.230 --> 05:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
oldest one he's 14.
 
05:22:23.430 --> 05:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
he got damaged from a vaccine to where
 
05:22:25.830 --> 05:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
he had bleeding of the brain
 
05:22:25.840 --> 05:22:27.270 align:start position:0%
he had bleeding of the brain
so

05:22:27.270 --> 05:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:22:29.510 --> 05:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be up to any one of you
 
05:22:31.750 --> 05:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
people in here to make decisions for
 
05:22:34.868 --> 05:22:34.878 align:start position:0%
parents what's good for their children
 
05:22:38.470 --> 05:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
and i you leave it up to the the family
 
05:22:40.788 --> 05:22:40.798 align:start position:0%
their doctor and then you make a
 
05:22:42.470 --> 05:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
decision but
 
05:22:44.788 --> 05:22:44.798 align:start position:0%
little charlie he had a whole life ahead
 
05:22:46.948 --> 05:22:46.958 align:start position:0%

to whittle it down to three minutes but
 
05:25:32.470 --> 05:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
all i can say at this point is i was in

tears when that woman described

her college student
 
05:25:40.628 --> 05:25:40.638 align:start position:0%
because that's my biggest fear
 
05:25:43.270 --> 05:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
it's my biggest fear that my little 13
 
05:25:46.390 --> 05:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
year old rock star of a catcher does not
 
05:25:49.030 --> 05:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
even think she can go to college on a
 
05:25:51.030 --> 05:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship because she can't go to a
 
05:25:53.190 --> 05:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire college i said hey we're
 
05:25:54.948 --> 05:25:54.958 align:start position:0%
going to go to florida mama we'll figure
 
05:25:57.910 --> 05:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
it out she doesn't even have a desire to
 
05:26:00.548 --> 05:26:00.558 align:start position:0%
even progress forward she just wants to
 
05:26:02.868 --> 05:26:02.878 align:start position:0%
play her whole softball team is
 
05:26:05.270 --> 05:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
vaccinated she is not
 
05:26:07.910 --> 05:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
and she's kind of she
 
05:26:10.470 --> 05:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
she's really bubbly and she's awesome
 
05:26:12.708 --> 05:26:12.718 align:start position:0%
and this isn't just about my kid it's
 
05:26:15.430 --> 05:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
about many kids she has a ton of friends
 
05:26:17.590 --> 05:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
that are not vaccinated and we all feel
 
05:26:20.708 --> 05:26:20.718 align:start position:0%
the same way we're shunned in school
 
05:26:22.788 --> 05:26:22.798 align:start position:0%
everyone's like do you have your vaccine
 
05:26:24.788 --> 05:26:24.798 align:start position:0%
i'm like you really talking about this
 
05:26:27.670 --> 05:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
we do not need mandates in schools we've
 
05:26:30.310 --> 05:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
got enough vaccines we are not in
 
05:26:33.030 --> 05:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
jeopardy of all dying because of the
 
05:26:35.350 --> 05:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
children i don't think there's been any
 
05:26:37.990 --> 05:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
deaths in litchfield's
 
05:26:39.510 --> 05:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
at this age group

05:26:46.230 --> 05:26:46.240 align:start position:0%

so again i'm tim lang i'm the uh
 
05:40:11.350 --> 05:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
three-year third term representative i'm
 
05:40:12.868 --> 05:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
the currently the chairman of the house
 
05:40:14.788 --> 05:40:14.798 align:start position:0%
fish and game committee and i'm here to
 
05:40:16.868 --> 05:40:16.878 align:start position:0%
introduce house bill 1035 which is
 
05:40:18.548 --> 05:40:18.558 align:start position:0%
relevant the exemptions of
 
05:40:20.868 --> 05:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
school vaccine mandates
 
05:40:22.788 --> 05:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
this bill on its faces is a fairly
 
05:40:24.390 --> 05:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
straightforward bill you can tell it's
 
05:40:26.150 --> 05:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
only one paragraph it didn't go into
 
05:40:28.070 --> 05:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
multiple pages
 
05:40:30.070 --> 05:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
and one of the things you have to so we
 
05:40:33.110 --> 05:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
establish a common understanding is that
 
05:40:35.110 --> 05:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
this is a lot of this is already allowed
 
05:40:37.110 --> 05:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
by law we already have an exemption
 
05:40:39.910 --> 05:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
statute in our in our immunization or
 
05:40:42.628 --> 05:40:42.638 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases statute under 141c
 
05:40:43.830 --> 05:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
that allow
 
05:40:46.230 --> 05:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
children to be able to get
 
05:40:47.830 --> 05:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
exemptions currently just under two
 
05:40:50.868 --> 05:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
categories medical and religious
 
05:40:53.030 --> 05:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
this bill adds a third category called
 
05:40:56.628 --> 05:40:56.638 align:start position:0%
conscient called conscientious objector
 
05:40:58.230 --> 05:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
conscientious objections
 
05:40:58.240 --> 05:40:59.190 align:start position:0%
conscientious objections
so

05:40:59.190 --> 05:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:41:01.670 --> 05:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
how i got there so i'm going to quickly
 
05:41:01.680 --> 05:41:03.190 align:start position:0%
how i got there so i'm going to quickly
read

05:41:03.190 --> 05:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
read
 
05:41:04.470 --> 05:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
a little section from our state
 
05:41:04.480 --> 05:41:05.910 align:start position:0%
a little section from our state
constitution

05:41:05.910 --> 05:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
05:41:09.110 --> 05:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
so under a state constitution article 3
 
05:41:11.430 --> 05:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
it talks about society it's or it's uh
 
05:41:13.190 --> 05:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
organization and purposes and it says
 
05:41:14.708 --> 05:41:14.718 align:start position:0%
when a man enters into a state of
 
05:41:17.110 --> 05:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
society they surrender up some of their
 
05:41:20.230 --> 05:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
natural rights to that society in order
 
05:41:21.910 --> 05:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
to ensure the protection of others and
 
05:41:23.670 --> 05:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
without such equivalent the surrender is
 
05:41:23.680 --> 05:41:24.948 align:start position:0%
without such equivalent the surrender is
void

05:41:24.948 --> 05:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
void
 
05:41:27.110 --> 05:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
so had their founders stopped right
 
05:41:29.350 --> 05:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
there i would say that maybe this is one
 
05:41:31.350 --> 05:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
of these rights that we give up however
 
05:41:33.590 --> 05:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's not they continued on with
 
05:41:35.830 --> 05:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
article number four right after article
 
05:41:37.510 --> 05:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
number three the right of conscious
 
05:41:39.830 --> 05:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
unalienable i had to look up the word
 
05:41:42.150 --> 05:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
unalienable it means that which is uh
 
05:41:44.788 --> 05:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
cannot be given or taken away
 
05:41:47.270 --> 05:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
so again they titled it specifically
 
05:41:49.670 --> 05:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh rights of conscience unalienable that
 
05:41:51.830 --> 05:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
did not be given or taken away
 
05:41:53.990 --> 05:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
among the natural rights some are in
 
05:41:56.788 --> 05:41:56.798 align:start position:0%
their very nature unalienable because no
 
05:41:58.788 --> 05:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
equivalent can be given receipt or
 
05:42:01.910 --> 05:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
received for them of this kind is the
 
05:42:05.110 --> 05:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
right of conscience
 
05:42:06.708 --> 05:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
again so i'd go further on you look in
 
05:42:08.470 --> 05:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
the constitution i go well tim you know
 
05:42:09.510 --> 05:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't say anything about
 
05:42:11.590 --> 05:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
religion so maybe religion we should get
 
05:42:14.070 --> 05:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
rid of that that exemption except that
 
05:42:15.990 --> 05:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
we go on to article five and again it
 
05:42:18.390 --> 05:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
specifically calls out religion and says
 
05:42:20.470 --> 05:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
religious freedom is recognized
 
05:42:22.390 --> 05:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
every individual has a natural and
 
05:42:25.030 --> 05:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
unalienable right to worship god
 
05:42:26.708 --> 05:42:26.718 align:start position:0%
according to their dictates of their own
 
05:42:26.718 --> 05:42:28.628 align:start position:0%
according to their dictates of their own
conscience

05:42:28.628 --> 05:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
05:42:31.190 --> 05:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
and reason and no subject shall be hurt
 
05:42:33.990 --> 05:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
molested or restrained in this person's
 
05:42:36.230 --> 05:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
liberty or a state for worshiping god in
 
05:42:38.390 --> 05:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
a manner that manner and season most
 
05:42:40.310 --> 05:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
agreeable to their dictates of their own
 
05:42:42.150 --> 05:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
conscience or in his religious
 
05:42:44.310 --> 05:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
profession settlements persuasion
 
05:42:46.150 --> 05:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
provided he does not disturb the public
 
05:42:48.150 --> 05:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
peace or disturb others in their
 
05:42:49.590 --> 05:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
religious worship
 
05:42:51.430 --> 05:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
so again it's pretty clear in our in our
 
05:42:53.750 --> 05:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
constitution we call out two specific
 
05:42:55.750 --> 05:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
rights uh that being the right of
 
05:42:57.990 --> 05:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
conscience and the right of religion
 
05:42:59.510 --> 05:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
so it makes sense that those things are
 
05:43:01.270 --> 05:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
in there
 
05:43:03.430 --> 05:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
i find it kind of one the right of
 
05:43:05.190 --> 05:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
conscious or conscious objector is the
 
05:43:06.788 --> 05:43:06.798 align:start position:0%
is one of the discussion points that
 
05:43:08.628 --> 05:43:08.638 align:start position:0%
i've had most why we're adding this and
 
05:43:10.070 --> 05:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
i i find and usually i get it from
 
05:43:11.830 --> 05:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
doctors like wow that shouldn't mean
 
05:43:15.350 --> 05:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
anybody tim can do it i find it kind of
 
05:43:16.868 --> 05:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
hypocritical is the word i'm going to
 
05:43:16.878 --> 05:43:17.750 align:start position:0%
hypocritical is the word i'm going to
use

05:43:17.750 --> 05:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
use
 
05:43:19.990 --> 05:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
because under hhs.gov right from the
 
05:43:22.150 --> 05:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
federal website
 
05:43:24.310 --> 05:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
conscientious protections for healthcare
 
05:43:24.320 --> 05:43:25.910 align:start position:0%
conscientious protections for healthcare
providers

05:43:25.910 --> 05:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
providers
 
05:43:27.750 --> 05:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
and right within the hhs website this is
 
05:43:30.390 --> 05:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
your right of your conscious rights
 
05:43:32.230 --> 05:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
conscience protections apply to all
 
05:43:34.310 --> 05:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
health care providers who refuse to
 
05:43:36.070 --> 05:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
perform accommodate or assist with
 
05:43:38.150 --> 05:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
certain health care services
 
05:43:41.110 --> 05:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
on religious or moral grounds
 
05:43:42.788 --> 05:43:42.798 align:start position:0%
where is this again police that's from
 
05:43:44.030 --> 05:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
the from the
 
05:43:47.350 --> 05:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
federalhhs.gov website it's hhs.gov
 
05:43:49.910 --> 05:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
conscience conscious protections dot
 
05:43:52.390 --> 05:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
html so when it goes on to say you may
 
05:43:53.830 --> 05:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
file a complaint under the federal
 
05:43:55.110 --> 05:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
health care provider conscious
 
05:43:57.350 --> 05:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
protection statutes if you believe you
 
05:43:59.190 --> 05:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
have experienced discrimination because
 
05:44:02.708 --> 05:44:02.718 align:start position:0%
you and one of the items is were coerced
 
05:44:04.470 --> 05:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
into performing procedures that are
 
05:44:07.590 --> 05:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
against your religious or moral beliefs
 
05:44:09.270 --> 05:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
so hear the same doctors saying no we
 
05:44:10.868 --> 05:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
have to give vaccines and at the same
 
05:44:12.150 --> 05:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
point they have protections like if i
 
05:44:14.070 --> 05:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
don't believe it i don't have to do it
 
05:44:16.150 --> 05:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
so it is a little little hypocritical to
 
05:44:17.590 --> 05:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
me that we have this conscientious
 
05:44:18.708 --> 05:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
objector component that they're
 
05:44:20.868 --> 05:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
protected from and yet they don't want
 
05:44:22.548 --> 05:44:22.558 align:start position:0%
to give that same protection to our
 
05:44:22.558 --> 05:44:24.548 align:start position:0%
to give that same protection to our
citizens

05:44:24.548 --> 05:44:24.558 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
05:44:26.310 --> 05:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
so the second thing this bill does after
 
05:44:28.470 --> 05:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
adding the conscientious objector
 
05:44:28.480 --> 05:44:29.270 align:start position:0%
adding the conscientious objector
is

05:44:29.270 --> 05:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:44:31.510 --> 05:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
i do away with the data point
 
05:44:33.510 --> 05:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the bill the bill says
 
05:44:35.750 --> 05:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
it actually defines the form
 
05:44:37.910 --> 05:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
that a parent would use to have their
 
05:44:39.670 --> 05:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
children exempt from
 
05:44:40.708 --> 05:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
the law
 
05:44:42.628 --> 05:44:42.638 align:start position:0%
and the reason that form is there is
 
05:44:44.390 --> 05:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
because you're not declaring which of
 
05:44:46.150 --> 05:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
the three exemptions you are just merely
 
05:44:48.230 --> 05:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
that you fall within one of the three
 
05:44:50.470 --> 05:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
why because we just passed article 2b
 
05:44:51.750 --> 05:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
that says the government doesn't need to
 
05:44:54.070 --> 05:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
collect your private information so why
 
05:44:56.310 --> 05:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
should i have to release to my doctor
 
05:44:58.708 --> 05:44:58.718 align:start position:0%
for my child that he has myocarditis or
 
05:45:00.150 --> 05:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
has a potential myocarditis and
 
05:45:01.110 --> 05:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
therefore he doesn't have to get the
 
05:45:02.470 --> 05:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine why does the government need to
 
05:45:04.390 --> 05:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
protect have that data i should be able
 
05:45:06.708 --> 05:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
to just assert the privilege and that's
 
05:45:08.310 --> 05:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
all that's needed same with the
 
05:45:10.788 --> 05:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
religious perce uh provision why do i
 
05:45:13.110 --> 05:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
have to prove that my child is religious
 
05:45:15.350 --> 05:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
enough to be entitled to a medical uh a
 
05:45:18.310 --> 05:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
religious exemption again these are data
 
05:45:19.350 --> 05:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
points the government are going to
 
05:45:21.830 --> 05:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
collect from our chu from us and for our
 
05:45:23.430 --> 05:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
children that i think is inappropriate
 
05:45:25.350 --> 05:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
especially in light of article 2b which
 
05:45:26.548 --> 05:45:26.558 align:start position:0%
says that the government shall not
 
05:45:28.230 --> 05:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
protect uh collect our private and
 
05:45:29.910 --> 05:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
personal data
 
05:45:32.470 --> 05:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
um the last thing i do in this bill is i
 
05:45:34.788 --> 05:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
take away the notary requirement
 
05:45:37.110 --> 05:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
um again this is an onerous provision
 
05:45:39.030 --> 05:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
that that you can go and register your
 
05:45:40.948 --> 05:45:40.958 align:start position:0%
child spend twenty thousand dollars of
 
05:45:42.788 --> 05:45:42.798 align:start position:0%
tax money to have your child educated in
 
05:45:44.948 --> 05:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
the public school system you never have
 
05:45:46.948 --> 05:45:46.958 align:start position:0%
to have anything notarized
 
05:45:48.788 --> 05:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
unless you want an exemption then you
 
05:45:50.230 --> 05:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
gotta go find a notary and deal with all
 
05:45:51.830 --> 05:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
that hassle to get a notary which just
 
05:45:53.590 --> 05:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
seems like an onerous provision on our
 
05:45:56.230 --> 05:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
citizens when i can spend 20 grand of
 
05:45:58.070 --> 05:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
state money but i can't i can't have my
 
05:45:59.430 --> 05:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
kid not vaccinated without getting some
 
05:46:01.590 --> 05:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
notary to sign a piece of paper
 
05:46:01.600 --> 05:46:02.830 align:start position:0%
notary to sign a piece of paper
um

05:46:02.830 --> 05:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:05.670 --> 05:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
so the last point i'm going to bring up
 
05:46:07.910 --> 05:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
two points one more um one of the
 
05:46:09.350 --> 05:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
reasons for taking away that data point
 
05:46:11.270 --> 05:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
was i was really concerned when i heard
 
05:46:14.548 --> 05:46:14.558 align:start position:0%
on september 12th of this last year the
 
05:46:14.558 --> 05:46:15.350 align:start position:0%
on september 12th of this last year the
u.s

05:46:15.350 --> 05:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
u.s
 
05:46:18.390 --> 05:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
surgeon general murthy dr murthy
 
05:46:20.708 --> 05:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
says that he's going to start monitoring
 
05:46:22.788 --> 05:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions to see if they're
 
05:46:25.270 --> 05:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
going to be if they're abused
 
05:46:27.030 --> 05:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
that was a statement made by our u.s
 
05:46:29.510 --> 05:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
surgeon general so what that means is
 
05:46:31.190 --> 05:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
government's going to start measuring
 
05:46:33.110 --> 05:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
whether you're spiritual enough to be
 
05:46:34.868 --> 05:46:34.878 align:start position:0%
entitled to a religious exemption that
 
05:46:36.628 --> 05:46:36.638 align:start position:0%
should be chilling to everybody in this
 
05:46:38.628 --> 05:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
room the idea that government's going to
 
05:46:40.868 --> 05:46:40.878 align:start position:0%
start mandating and worrying about and
 
05:46:42.470 --> 05:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
finding out if you're really religious
 
05:46:45.030 --> 05:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
enough to get that exemption or not
 
05:46:46.948 --> 05:46:46.958 align:start position:0%
so the last point i make is more of just
 
05:46:49.750 --> 05:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
another data point and i i'd asked does
 
05:46:51.830 --> 05:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
anybody have any idea what percentage of
 
05:46:54.708 --> 05:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
cities of our children are uh
 
05:46:56.548 --> 05:46:56.558 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated in our state that ask for
 
05:46:58.310 --> 05:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
medical or religious
 
05:46:58.320 --> 05:46:59.670 align:start position:0%
medical or religious
2.6

05:46:59.670 --> 05:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
2.6
 
05:47:02.628 --> 05:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
over 90 of our citizens our children are
 
05:47:04.548 --> 05:47:04.558 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and and that's through the
 
05:47:06.708 --> 05:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
voluntary vaccination requests even with
 
05:47:08.628 --> 05:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
the exemptions we have
 
05:47:10.708 --> 05:47:10.718 align:start position:0%
so when we think about herd immunity and
 
05:47:11.990 --> 05:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's the other one tim if you put this
 
05:47:13.030 --> 05:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
bill in we're going to lose hurt
 
05:47:14.470 --> 05:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
immunity in our schools we won't be able
 
05:47:16.548 --> 05:47:16.558 align:start position:0%
to do it herd immunity threshold is 70
 
05:47:16.558 --> 05:47:18.948 align:start position:0%
to do it herd immunity threshold is 70
percent

05:47:18.948 --> 05:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:47:18.958 --> 05:47:20.948 align:start position:0%
percent
so

05:47:20.948 --> 05:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:47:22.788 --> 05:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
70 is the threshold the beginning part
 
05:47:24.310 --> 05:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
of where herd immunity goes they say
 
05:47:26.230 --> 05:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 70 to 90 but the threshold
 
05:47:28.628 --> 05:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
is 70 for herd immunity we're well
 
05:47:29.750 --> 05:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
beyond that
 
05:47:32.070 --> 05:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
our children are not out doing this i
 
05:47:34.470 --> 05:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
would also postulate that
 
05:47:36.390 --> 05:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
anybody who has
 
05:47:38.470 --> 05:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
conscientious objector exemptions are
 
05:47:40.150 --> 05:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
already probably using medical exemption
 
05:47:42.470 --> 05:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
anyway the medical or the religious
 
05:47:44.390 --> 05:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
exemption anyway in filing this bill
 
05:47:46.868 --> 05:47:46.878 align:start position:0%
will not drastically change
 
05:47:48.868 --> 05:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
the number of people filing for
 
05:47:50.390 --> 05:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
religious or medical or conscientious
 
05:47:52.628 --> 05:47:52.638 align:start position:0%
objector exemptions i doubt it will go
 
05:47:54.708 --> 05:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
much much beyond three percent and it
 
05:47:56.948 --> 05:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
just allows our citizens to be honest
 
05:47:58.708 --> 05:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
instead of instead of having a
 
05:48:00.708 --> 05:48:00.718 align:start position:0%
conscientious objector i'll give you the
 
05:48:02.948 --> 05:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
example i call it the organic lifestyle
 
05:48:04.230 --> 05:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
there are people that choose to grow
 
05:48:06.470 --> 05:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
their own chickens and and get their own
 
05:48:08.470 --> 05:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
eggs and and grow their own crops and
 
05:48:10.470 --> 05:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
step away from
 
05:48:11.990 --> 05:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know modern life if you will
 
05:48:13.910 --> 05:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
industrialize food and those kind of
 
05:48:15.270 --> 05:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
things those people choose to live an
 
05:48:18.390 --> 05:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
organic life my ex-wife is one of those
 
05:48:22.628 --> 05:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:25.510 --> 05:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
but given that um one of the things that
 
05:48:27.830 --> 05:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
i we we do is we look for healthy
 
05:48:30.070 --> 05:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
alternatives before medical alternatives
 
05:48:32.390 --> 05:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
so in my case my family has a history of
 
05:48:34.150 --> 05:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
heart disease so when i went to saw my
 
05:48:37.110 --> 05:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
cardiologist when i turned 50 years old
 
05:48:38.628 --> 05:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
they wanted to put me on a statin drugs
 
05:48:39.990 --> 05:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
my mom and dad both died of heart
 
05:48:41.750 --> 05:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
disease and two brothers that died of
 
05:48:42.948 --> 05:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
heart disease i didn't have any
 
05:48:44.628 --> 05:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
indication of heart disease but they
 
05:48:45.830 --> 05:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to give me a preventative
 
05:48:48.230 --> 05:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
medicine because that was the history i
 
05:48:50.470 --> 05:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
had in my family and i was like is there
 
05:48:51.990 --> 05:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
anything we can do before you put me on
 
05:48:53.350 --> 05:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
a drug i gotta take for the rest of my
 
05:48:53.360 --> 05:48:54.390 align:start position:0%
a drug i gotta take for the rest of my
life

05:48:54.390 --> 05:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
life
 
05:48:56.310 --> 05:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
and the answer was yeah diet and
 
05:48:58.070 --> 05:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
exercise i'm like great so i went on a
 
05:48:59.670 --> 05:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
diet and exercise and as you can tell
 
05:49:01.350 --> 05:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not in bad shape i wouldn't say i'm
 
05:49:03.350 --> 05:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
in great shape but i'm not in bad shape
 
05:49:05.270 --> 05:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
and when they put me on my treadmill for
 
05:49:07.350 --> 05:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
my test i ran 21 minutes on the
 
05:49:09.270 --> 05:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
treadmill no sign of coronary disease
 
05:49:10.548 --> 05:49:10.558 align:start position:0%
they said thank you mr lang have a nice
 
05:49:12.310 --> 05:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
day keep up what you're doing
 
05:49:13.910 --> 05:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
but otherwise i've done modern medicine
 
05:49:15.830 --> 05:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
i would've took a pill every day
 
05:49:17.830 --> 05:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
and and we shouldn't make our people do
 
05:49:19.350 --> 05:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
that there should be alternatives we
 
05:49:20.470 --> 05:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
should allow people to live the
 
05:49:22.788 --> 05:49:22.798 align:start position:0%
lifestyle that they want to live
 
05:49:24.948 --> 05:49:24.958 align:start position:0%
that protects them that's morally right
 
05:49:26.150 --> 05:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
for them
 
05:49:27.510 --> 05:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
and for therefore that's why you have
 
05:49:29.430 --> 05:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
this bill in front of you be happy to
 
05:49:33.750 --> 05:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:36.230 --> 05:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
of the representative representative
 
05:49:39.030 --> 05:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
nada upham
 
05:49:41.190 --> 05:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman thanks for taking
 
05:49:44.070 --> 05:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
my question representative um
 
05:49:45.990 --> 05:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to clarify that you said
 
05:49:48.628 --> 05:49:48.638 align:start position:0%
90 of the children in new hampshire are
 
05:49:51.750 --> 05:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and that's the measles mumps
 
05:49:54.150 --> 05:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
rebel those
 
05:49:56.230 --> 05:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
based on last year's census numbers from
 
05:49:58.150 --> 05:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
doe which i pulled right off their
 
05:50:00.948 --> 05:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
website it was actually it was only 2.6
 
05:50:02.310 --> 05:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
were unvaccinated but then they have
 
05:50:03.990 --> 05:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
what they call preliminary which are
 
05:50:05.750 --> 05:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
kids that have not turned into paperwork
 
05:50:07.830 --> 05:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
yet so i said 90 be nice i think the
 
05:50:10.390 --> 05:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
number's higher but i said 90 to play it
 
05:50:11.910 --> 05:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
down as short as possible i think the
 
05:50:14.230 --> 05:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
number's probably closer to 94 to 95
 
05:50:16.548 --> 05:50:16.558 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much let me clarify
 
05:50:18.868 --> 05:50:18.878 align:start position:0%
i may have missed something but you said
 
05:50:21.430 --> 05:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
vaccinated does that mean vaccinated
 
05:50:23.270 --> 05:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
against the traditional things like
 
05:50:26.070 --> 05:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
polio and so on but not covet this is
 
05:50:28.230 --> 05:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
not a covert number that's correct my
 
05:50:30.070 --> 05:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
bill is not covet specific and this is
 
05:50:31.910 --> 05:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
relative to the standard
 
05:50:31.920 --> 05:50:32.708 align:start position:0%
relative to the standard
under

05:50:32.708 --> 05:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
under
 
05:50:34.548 --> 05:50:34.558 align:start position:0%
141 c
 
05:50:37.590 --> 05:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
20 is that it 20 um has the
 
05:50:39.270 --> 05:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
vaccines that are required to attend
 
05:50:40.708 --> 05:50:40.718 align:start position:0%
school and it's the kids that meet that
 
05:50:42.708 --> 05:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
requirement under the current law
 
05:50:44.948 --> 05:50:44.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:50:46.470 --> 05:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
05:50:46.480 --> 05:50:49.670 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
delemus

05:50:49.670 --> 05:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:51.670 --> 05:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman actually i wanted
 
05:50:54.390 --> 05:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
to just direct it to you did we receive
 
05:50:56.470 --> 05:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
written testimony from representative
 
05:50:56.480 --> 05:50:58.150 align:start position:0%
written testimony from representative
lang

05:50:58.150 --> 05:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
lang
 
05:50:59.510 --> 05:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
did not but i can submit it if you'd
 
05:50:59.520 --> 05:51:03.590 align:start position:0%
did not but i can submit it if you'd
like

05:51:03.590 --> 05:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:05.830 --> 05:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
 
05:51:07.350 --> 05:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
05:51:09.430 --> 05:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
lang for taking the question
 
05:51:11.670 --> 05:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
when i look at this it seems that right
 
05:51:13.670 --> 05:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
now we do just have to have the
 
05:51:16.230 --> 05:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
notarized form for religious exemptions
 
05:51:17.830 --> 05:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
do you think that this further would
 
05:51:20.708 --> 05:51:20.718 align:start position:0%
protect um protect against any overreach
 
05:51:21.990 --> 05:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
like we're seeing from the surgeon
 
05:51:23.910 --> 05:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
general and some of these companies that
 
05:51:27.110 --> 05:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
are compiling people's religious beliefs
 
05:51:28.470 --> 05:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
and do you think that broad line's even
 
05:51:29.910 --> 05:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
more important when you have students
 
05:51:31.510 --> 05:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
who have a permanent record who's
 
05:51:33.910 --> 05:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
assembled with all of these records yes
 
05:51:35.910 --> 05:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
i do again i i think that anytime
 
05:51:37.030 --> 05:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
government's starting to collect
 
05:51:38.628 --> 05:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
personal data especially about what my
 
05:51:40.548 --> 05:51:40.558 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs are that's something
 
05:51:41.990 --> 05:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
that should cause everybody to go uh
 
05:51:43.270 --> 05:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
wait a second
 
05:51:44.470 --> 05:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
you know government doesn't have that
 
05:51:46.070 --> 05:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
need or that requirement nor should they
 
05:51:48.390 --> 05:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
do it
 
05:51:50.548 --> 05:51:50.558 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
05:51:52.150 --> 05:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:51:55.030 --> 05:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:56.310 --> 05:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
i think i'm following along with you
 
05:51:56.320 --> 05:51:57.190 align:start position:0%
i think i'm following along with you
except

05:51:57.190 --> 05:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
except
 
05:51:59.510 --> 05:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure whether a parent has the
 
05:52:01.830 --> 05:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
where for all or the knowledge to
 
05:52:03.990 --> 05:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
declare something being medical
 
05:52:05.510 --> 05:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
i think i can understand the religious
 
05:52:07.510 --> 05:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
conscientious part of it but the medical
 
05:52:09.910 --> 05:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
part i think should still reside with
 
05:52:11.510 --> 05:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
medical people so if you go back and
 
05:52:13.030 --> 05:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
look at the statute
 
05:52:14.628 --> 05:52:14.638 align:start position:0%
and the first part it says if you want a
 
05:52:16.868 --> 05:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
medical one you have to go to a position
 
05:52:18.470 --> 05:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
somebody who has the medical knowledge
 
05:52:20.230 --> 05:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
and training to give that exemption
 
05:52:21.750 --> 05:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
however if you want a religious one a
 
05:52:23.750 --> 05:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
conscientious one you could actually do
 
05:52:25.190 --> 05:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
that yourself
 
05:52:25.200 --> 05:52:26.470 align:start position:0%
that yourself
so

05:52:26.470 --> 05:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:52:27.910 --> 05:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
so that
 
05:52:29.430 --> 05:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
right now under current law you only do
 
05:52:31.270 --> 05:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
medical and religious medical requires a
 
05:52:32.788 --> 05:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
doctor's note religious requires a
 
05:52:35.430 --> 05:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
notary um adding conscience subject to
 
05:52:36.708 --> 05:52:36.718 align:start position:0%
your right
 
05:52:38.868 --> 05:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
again one of the reasoning for doing
 
05:52:41.030 --> 05:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
that is taking away a data point if i'm
 
05:52:42.868 --> 05:52:42.878 align:start position:0%
not if a parent isn't asking for any
 
05:52:44.310 --> 05:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
other accommodation other than the fact
 
05:52:46.230 --> 05:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
that my child's not going to be exempted
 
05:52:48.150 --> 05:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
then why do i need to give medical data
 
05:52:50.390 --> 05:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
to the school well again myocarditis has
 
05:52:52.230 --> 05:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the kid in school
 
05:52:53.910 --> 05:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
he's not asking for any other extra
 
05:52:56.708 --> 05:52:56.718 align:start position:0%
accommodations other than an exempt
 
05:53:01.830 --> 05:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:01.840 --> 05:53:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:53:05.750 --> 05:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:08.628 --> 05:53:08.638 align:start position:0%
you wanted to follow up sure sorry
 
05:53:10.070 --> 05:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
i think i'm tracking with you so
 
05:53:10.080 --> 05:53:11.270 align:start position:0%
i think i'm tracking with you so
basically

05:53:11.270 --> 05:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
basically
 
05:53:13.510 --> 05:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
um if we go back into the statute as
 
05:53:16.150 --> 05:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
written now and at that point in time
 
05:53:18.868 --> 05:53:18.878 align:start position:0%
strike notarized form
 
05:53:21.670 --> 05:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
and then add conscientious to religious
 
05:53:23.830 --> 05:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
with that satisfy we're trying to get to
 
05:53:25.110 --> 05:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
because that still allows for the
 
05:53:27.430 --> 05:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
medical to be done by the medical people
 
05:53:28.708 --> 05:53:28.718 align:start position:0%
if you're telling me that's the only way
 
05:53:30.230 --> 05:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
the bill will be passed yes i'll accept
 
05:53:34.868 --> 05:53:34.878 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative folsom
 
05:53:37.350 --> 05:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:53:39.750 --> 05:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
05:53:43.350 --> 05:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
did you know that there are 25 federal
 
05:53:45.670 --> 05:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
agencies that are collecting
 
05:53:45.680 --> 05:53:46.708 align:start position:0%
agencies that are collecting
this

05:53:46.708 --> 05:53:46.718 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:53:50.708 --> 05:53:50.718 align:start position:0%
religious information or for the
 
05:53:52.470 --> 05:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
religious exemption
 
05:53:57.190 --> 05:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:58.868 --> 05:53:58.878 align:start position:0%
date of birth
 
05:54:01.590 --> 05:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
the name contact information
 
05:54:04.150 --> 05:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
religious affiliation and the reason for
 
05:54:06.070 --> 05:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
seeking the exemption
 
05:54:09.030 --> 05:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
and one that i cannot figure out why
 
05:54:13.110 --> 05:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:16.788 --> 05:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:19.590 --> 05:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
well again you know i the point of that
 
05:54:21.270 --> 05:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
one of the main points of this bill
 
05:54:22.390 --> 05:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
isn't just to add to conscience
 
05:54:24.230 --> 05:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
objectors to take away the data point
 
05:54:25.910 --> 05:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
that the government can collect because
 
05:54:28.868 --> 05:54:28.878 align:start position:0%
again under our our constitution uh
 
05:54:32.110 --> 05:54:32.120 align:start position:0%
article 2b which was just passed in 1980
 
05:54:35.670 --> 05:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
1918 and i mean like 2018 i think it was
 
05:54:37.510 --> 05:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
when i my first term in the legislature
 
05:54:40.868 --> 05:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
and it passed with an 85 percent
 
05:54:43.350 --> 05:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
um vote our citizens don't want
 
05:54:45.590 --> 05:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
government collecting our data so this
 
05:54:47.750 --> 05:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
bill goes along the lines of that that
 
05:54:49.750 --> 05:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
and allows you to ask for an exemption
 
05:54:51.670 --> 05:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
without having to disclose personal data
 
05:54:53.910 --> 05:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
to the government
 
05:54:56.628 --> 05:54:56.638 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro thank you mr
 
05:54:58.230 --> 05:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking this
 
05:54:58.240 --> 05:54:59.190 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking this
question

05:54:59.190 --> 05:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:54:59.200 --> 05:55:02.708 align:start position:0%
question
um

05:55:02.708 --> 05:55:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:05.030 --> 05:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
you made i would say you made some very
 
05:55:09.990 --> 05:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
compelling um arguments based on
 
05:55:13.190 --> 05:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
rights of conscience and um
 
05:55:15.590 --> 05:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
also on the fact that the
 
05:55:17.830 --> 05:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
amount of the number of unvaccinated
 
05:55:19.670 --> 05:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
people the percentage of unvaccinated
 
05:55:22.150 --> 05:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
children is very small and that you have
 
05:55:24.470 --> 05:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
reason to believe that that would not
 
05:55:25.990 --> 05:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
change very much
 
05:55:27.670 --> 05:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
um and i'm not
 
05:55:30.230 --> 05:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
disagreeing with you necessarily
 
05:55:32.390 --> 05:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
but you also made comments started off
 
05:55:33.590 --> 05:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
your comments
 
05:55:35.910 --> 05:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
talking about the constitution and the
 
05:55:38.150 --> 05:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
kind of balance between the common good
 
05:55:40.070 --> 05:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
and personal freedom
 
05:55:42.548 --> 05:55:42.558 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering that if this bill was
 
05:55:44.548 --> 05:55:44.558 align:start position:0%
to pass or if
 
05:55:46.390 --> 05:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
you when you contemplate this bill
 
05:55:46.400 --> 05:55:50.628 align:start position:0%
you when you contemplate this bill
passing

05:55:50.628 --> 05:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:52.948 --> 05:55:52.958 align:start position:0%
and you were wrong and the number of
 
05:55:54.948 --> 05:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated children increased
 
05:55:54.958 --> 05:55:56.390 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated children increased
dramatically

05:55:56.390 --> 05:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
dramatically
 
05:55:56.400 --> 05:55:57.270 align:start position:0%
dramatically
um

05:55:57.270 --> 05:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:00.470 --> 05:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
at what point would you feel like
 
05:56:02.390 --> 05:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
that was a problem
 
05:56:03.830 --> 05:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
or would you not feel like that was a
 
05:56:05.830 --> 05:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
problem because there have been
 
05:56:07.670 --> 05:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
outbreaks of some of these illnesses in
 
05:56:09.830 --> 05:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
areas where people have not been
 
05:56:12.230 --> 05:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinated their children so my question
 
05:56:14.230 --> 05:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
basically is at what point
 
05:56:16.150 --> 05:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
could you conceive of this becoming a
 
05:56:18.150 --> 05:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
problem if the number of unvaccinated
 
05:56:18.160 --> 05:56:19.590 align:start position:0%
problem if the number of unvaccinated
increased

05:56:19.590 --> 05:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
increased
 
05:56:19.600 --> 05:56:20.390 align:start position:0%
increased
so

05:56:20.390 --> 05:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:56:22.310 --> 05:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
looking at this bill it's you know i
 
05:56:23.750 --> 05:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
talk about looking through a straw
 
05:56:25.350 --> 05:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes so if you just look at this
 
05:56:26.868 --> 05:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
bill and you look through a straw you
 
05:56:28.390 --> 05:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
see just that one thing but you forget
 
05:56:30.070 --> 05:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
there are a whole bunch of other
 
05:56:32.390 --> 05:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
infectious disease statutes including
 
05:56:33.910 --> 05:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
statutes that give the commissioner of
 
05:56:35.190 --> 05:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
health and human services emergency
 
05:56:37.110 --> 05:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
oversight privileges so if there was an
 
05:56:39.270 --> 05:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
outbreak the the commissioner has
 
05:56:41.350 --> 05:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
authority to act differently and change
 
05:56:43.350 --> 05:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
rules right so we're talking about in
 
05:56:46.390 --> 05:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
the regular course of life right and so
 
05:56:48.708 --> 05:56:48.718 align:start position:0%
the commissioner which i think you heard
 
05:56:49.990 --> 05:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
an oversight
 
05:56:52.868 --> 05:56:52.878 align:start position:0%
bill today um so again the commissioner
 
05:56:55.350 --> 05:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
has during outbreaks different authority
 
05:56:57.350 --> 05:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
to do different things and so again i
 
05:56:59.190 --> 05:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
i'd urge you not to look at this through
 
05:57:00.230 --> 05:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
a straw
 
05:57:01.990 --> 05:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
but to look it as a big painted picture
 
05:57:03.670 --> 05:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
right this is just one piece of that
 
05:57:05.910 --> 05:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
picture and that is that in under normal
 
05:57:07.750 --> 05:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances our parents have the right
 
05:57:09.830 --> 05:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
to choose to be exempt from this from
 
05:57:11.830 --> 05:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines or have their children exempt
 
05:57:13.510 --> 05:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
in the case of an outbreak there are a
 
05:57:16.070 --> 05:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
whole new set of rules um and that's
 
05:57:17.670 --> 05:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
outlined in the communicable disease
 
05:57:17.680 --> 05:57:19.510 align:start position:0%
outlined in the communicable disease
statutes

05:57:19.510 --> 05:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
05:57:20.708 --> 05:57:20.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:57:22.628 --> 05:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
05:57:25.190 --> 05:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman are you concerned
 
05:57:27.590 --> 05:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
if we struck that
 
05:57:29.830 --> 05:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
option to be a
 
05:57:32.708 --> 05:57:32.718 align:start position:0%
objector for medical reasons you know
 
05:57:32.718 --> 05:57:33.990 align:start position:0%
objector for medical reasons you know
parental

05:57:33.990 --> 05:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
parental
 
05:57:34.000 --> 05:57:34.868 align:start position:0%
parental
medic

05:57:34.868 --> 05:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
medic
 
05:57:36.788 --> 05:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to say this
 
05:57:38.548 --> 05:57:38.558 align:start position:0%
but right now it's medical religious or
 
05:57:38.558 --> 05:57:40.548 align:start position:0%
but right now it's medical religious or
conscientious

05:57:40.548 --> 05:57:40.558 align:start position:0%
conscientious
 
05:57:42.948 --> 05:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
if we struck the medical
 
05:57:45.190 --> 05:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that risk make us risk what
 
05:57:47.190 --> 05:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
happened to the lady who testified in
 
05:57:50.470 --> 05:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
blue that they couldn't find any doctor
 
05:57:53.430 --> 05:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
who was willing to write a medical uh
 
05:57:53.440 --> 05:57:54.548 align:start position:0%
who was willing to write a medical uh
exemption

05:57:54.548 --> 05:57:54.558 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
05:57:56.470 --> 05:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
well so the good thing under my bill is
 
05:57:58.628 --> 05:57:58.638 align:start position:0%
that the medic you're not declaring
 
05:57:59.830 --> 05:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
anything so you don't need a doctor's
 
05:58:02.230 --> 05:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
note if you pass my bill as it's written
 
05:58:05.750 --> 05:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
um if you go to um the suggestion of
 
05:58:07.430 --> 05:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
leaving chapter one in which deals with
 
05:58:09.590 --> 05:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
medical and just adjusting uh chapter
 
05:58:11.030 --> 05:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
two and adding the conscientious
 
05:58:12.230 --> 05:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
objector in there and taking away the
 
05:58:14.150 --> 05:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
nota requirement you would still have
 
05:58:15.830 --> 05:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
the medical you can't strike medical
 
05:58:18.310 --> 05:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
because we also have the whole again you
 
05:58:20.070 --> 05:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
can't look through a straw we have the
 
05:58:22.390 --> 05:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
whole federal ada you know american
 
05:58:24.310 --> 05:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
disabilities act which has which also
 
05:58:25.990 --> 05:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
oversights the met the reason for
 
05:58:27.990 --> 05:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
medical exemptions is because you have
 
05:58:30.310 --> 05:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
certain medical conditions that require
 
05:58:30.320 --> 05:58:32.310 align:start position:0%
certain medical conditions that require
unique

05:58:32.310 --> 05:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
unique
 
05:58:34.310 --> 05:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
action by an employer in this case by a
 
05:58:37.030 --> 05:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
school district so again you can't look
 
05:58:38.470 --> 05:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
through a straw that if you struck
 
05:58:40.868 --> 05:58:40.878 align:start position:0%
medical you would still be we'd still be
 
05:58:42.948 --> 05:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
subject to ada and an american
 
05:58:44.868 --> 05:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
disabilities act for a parent who chose
 
05:58:46.628 --> 05:58:46.638 align:start position:0%
to disclose a medical condition and
 
05:58:50.230 --> 05:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:52.548 --> 05:58:52.558 align:start position:0%
representative soloway mr truman this is
 
05:58:54.470 --> 05:58:54.480 align:start position:0%

something
 
06:00:02.230 --> 06:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:04.628 --> 06:00:04.638 align:start position:0%

way
 
06:00:16.150 --> 06:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
the forgetting stuff gets worse as you
 
06:00:19.430 --> 06:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
get older so get ready
 
06:00:21.750 --> 06:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
yes i did distribute testimony regarding
 
06:00:25.350 --> 06:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
this just a little while ago um
 
06:00:25.360 --> 06:00:26.150 align:start position:0%
this just a little while ago um
so

06:00:26.150 --> 06:00:26.160 align:start position:0%

i think i really thank representative
 
06:00:30.310 --> 06:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
lang for not bringing a bill about
 
06:00:32.390 --> 06:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
coveted vaccines
 
06:00:33.910 --> 06:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
it is important to realize that it is
 
06:00:35.750 --> 06:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
about a number of other well-established
 
06:00:37.910 --> 06:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
long-standing long-standing accepted
 
06:00:37.920 --> 06:00:39.510 align:start position:0%
long-standing long-standing accepted
vaccines

06:00:39.510 --> 06:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
06:00:41.350 --> 06:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
it expands the available exemptions for
 
06:00:43.110 --> 06:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
required immunizations for admission to
 
06:00:45.510 --> 06:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
a school or child care agency public and
 
06:00:48.150 --> 06:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
private that is in the statute already
 
06:00:49.350 --> 06:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
the reason
 
06:00:50.548 --> 06:00:50.558 align:start position:0%
that these
 
06:00:52.310 --> 06:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
immunizations are required to attend
 
06:00:54.470 --> 06:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
schools and child care is that
 
06:00:56.948 --> 06:00:56.958 align:start position:0%
schools and child care are incredibly
 
06:00:58.948 --> 06:00:58.958 align:start position:0%
effective settings for the transmission
 
06:01:01.270 --> 06:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
of communicable diseases especially
 
06:01:03.670 --> 06:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
respiratory diseases and any parent in
 
06:01:07.190 --> 06:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
this room can certainly vouch for that
 
06:01:10.470 --> 06:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
now because hb1 1035 automatically
 
06:01:12.948 --> 06:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
grants an exemption just with a request
 
06:01:14.628 --> 06:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
including for conscientious rejection
 
06:01:18.230 --> 06:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
which uh is also not actually defined
 
06:01:20.150 --> 06:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
it essentially removes any requirement
 
06:01:22.070 --> 06:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
for immunization
 
06:01:22.080 --> 06:01:23.510 align:start position:0%
for immunization
um

06:01:23.510 --> 06:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:23.520 --> 06:01:24.230 align:start position:0%
um
the

06:01:24.230 --> 06:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:01:26.070 --> 06:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
and i should also comment when vivek
 
06:01:27.750 --> 06:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
murthy made that comment about
 
06:01:29.590 --> 06:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
abusive religious exemptions i think he
 
06:01:31.590 --> 06:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
was speaking explicitly about covet and
 
06:01:32.868 --> 06:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
it had due to the fact that people would
 
06:01:35.270 --> 06:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
ex requested a religious exemption for
 
06:01:36.948 --> 06:01:36.958 align:start position:0%
one vaccine but not for others which
 
06:01:40.548 --> 06:01:40.558 align:start position:0%
would indicate an inconsistency
 
06:01:42.470 --> 06:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
with regard to conscientious objection
 
06:01:46.390 --> 06:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh i applied as a co in the draft back
 
06:01:48.708 --> 06:01:48.718 align:start position:0%
during the vietnam war and i had to
 
06:01:51.510 --> 06:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
actually still have my six page essay
 
06:01:52.948 --> 06:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
that i had to write
 
06:01:54.868 --> 06:01:54.878 align:start position:0%
justifying why i felt that i was a
 
06:01:56.868 --> 06:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
conscientious objector there's nothing
 
06:01:59.270 --> 06:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
here other than just saying i object so
 
06:02:01.990 --> 06:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
that kind of takes it away
 
06:02:03.430 --> 06:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
also i want to comment just quickly
 
06:02:05.750 --> 06:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
about that comment about a vaccine
 
06:02:07.510 --> 06:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
that was stated earlier that these
 
06:02:09.590 --> 06:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
things aren't really vaccines you got to
 
06:02:11.910 --> 06:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
understand that the definition about a
 
06:02:14.150 --> 06:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine that produces protection from an
 
06:02:16.230 --> 06:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
infectious disease the current one has
 
06:02:17.910 --> 06:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
to do with the fact that vaccines have
 
06:02:20.070 --> 06:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
evolved let's think of the 1950s if we
 
06:02:22.470 --> 06:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
defined what a telephone is
 
06:02:24.310 --> 06:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's a thing that sits on your desk with
 
06:02:26.150 --> 06:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
a wire going to a handset with a speaker
 
06:02:28.470 --> 06:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
and a microphone and then it has a wire
 
06:02:30.310 --> 06:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
that goes to the wall if you any of our
 
06:02:31.990 --> 06:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
grandkids would only see that in a
 
06:02:33.910 --> 06:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
museum so we do have to update
 
06:02:35.670 --> 06:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
definitions it's important to realize
 
06:02:39.590 --> 06:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
that for example not all uh vaccines are
 
06:02:41.270 --> 06:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
giving you a
 
06:02:44.390 --> 06:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
pathogen uh the tetanus vaccine is not
 
06:02:46.548 --> 06:02:46.558 align:start position:0%
at all against the clostridium tetani
 
06:02:47.910 --> 06:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
it's against the toxin that is
 
06:02:50.390 --> 06:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
elaborated by clostridium tetani to
 
06:02:52.708 --> 06:02:52.718 align:start position:0%
protect you from disease so we are
 
06:02:54.150 --> 06:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
06:02:56.628 --> 06:02:56.638 align:start position:0%
broadly diseases or in what's in the
 
06:02:59.030 --> 06:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
chapter immunizations and the acquired
 
06:03:01.590 --> 06:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
immunizations on 141 c 28 are diphtheria
 
06:03:04.230 --> 06:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
mumps pertussis polio rubella rubiola
 
06:03:05.350 --> 06:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
and tetanus
 
06:03:07.670 --> 06:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
vaccination has been one of the most
 
06:03:09.350 --> 06:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
effective public
 
06:03:11.110 --> 06:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh health measures in the history of
 
06:03:11.120 --> 06:03:12.628 align:start position:0%
uh health measures in the history of
mankind

06:03:12.628 --> 06:03:12.638 align:start position:0%
mankind
 
06:03:14.310 --> 06:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
if you've ever gone out and explored
 
06:03:16.390 --> 06:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
some of our old cemeteries and we have a
 
06:03:17.750 --> 06:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
lot of them
 
06:03:19.510 --> 06:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's kind of interesting to notice in
 
06:03:21.430 --> 06:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
the 18th and 19th century how many
 
06:03:23.670 --> 06:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
children died young
 
06:03:25.590 --> 06:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
often you notice notice that in one
 
06:03:27.030 --> 06:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
little family plot there's going to be
 
06:03:29.430 --> 06:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
two or three kids that all died the same
 
06:03:29.440 --> 06:03:30.788 align:start position:0%
two or three kids that all died the same
month

06:03:30.788 --> 06:03:30.798 align:start position:0%
month
 
06:03:31.990 --> 06:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
why is that
 
06:03:33.510 --> 06:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
well it's frequently from infectious
 
06:03:33.520 --> 06:03:34.708 align:start position:0%
well it's frequently from infectious
disease

06:03:34.708 --> 06:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
disease
 
06:03:37.590 --> 06:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
and diseases we now control either with
 
06:03:37.600 --> 06:03:39.030 align:start position:0%
and diseases we now control either with
vaccination

06:03:39.030 --> 06:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
06:03:41.590 --> 06:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
or bacterial diseases we control with
 
06:03:41.600 --> 06:03:44.470 align:start position:0%
or bacterial diseases we control with
antibiotics

06:03:44.470 --> 06:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:46.230 --> 06:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
i've cared for patients who contracted
 
06:03:49.270 --> 06:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
polio before the vaccine was developed
 
06:03:50.948 --> 06:03:50.958 align:start position:0%
my most memorable
 
06:03:53.670 --> 06:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
being a patient who was my age who
 
06:03:56.470 --> 06:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
contracted polio just before the vaccine
 
06:03:57.910 --> 06:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
was available
 
06:03:59.430 --> 06:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
leaving him with severe paralytic
 
06:03:59.440 --> 06:04:01.190 align:start position:0%
leaving him with severe paralytic
scoliosis

06:04:01.190 --> 06:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
scoliosis
 
06:04:02.948 --> 06:04:02.958 align:start position:0%
and when i met him he had about seven
 
06:04:05.030 --> 06:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
failed surgeries on his spine
 
06:04:06.948 --> 06:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
leaving him bent forward to the side and
 
06:04:09.110 --> 06:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
in constant pain and i completely took
 
06:04:10.628 --> 06:04:10.638 align:start position:0%
apart his spine and refused him with
 
06:04:12.548 --> 06:04:12.558 align:start position:0%
rods and screws which were not available
 
06:04:13.670 --> 06:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
when he had all of his previous
 
06:04:17.270 --> 06:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
operations in a 22-hour long operation
 
06:04:19.350 --> 06:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
and i often thought about the fact that
 
06:04:20.868 --> 06:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
that could have been me
 
06:04:22.230 --> 06:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
that could have been my problem except
 
06:04:24.548 --> 06:04:24.558 align:start position:0%
for the luck that i had
 
06:04:26.310 --> 06:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
dodged the bullet before the vaccine was
 
06:04:26.320 --> 06:04:28.470 align:start position:0%
dodged the bullet before the vaccine was
available

06:04:28.470 --> 06:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
available
 
06:04:31.110 --> 06:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
we've seen scattered outbreaks of polio
 
06:04:33.590 --> 06:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
secondary to lack of vaccination in the
 
06:04:35.510 --> 06:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
occasional communities and we've also
 
06:04:37.190 --> 06:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
seen as you've all known as i alluded to
 
06:04:39.270 --> 06:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
earlier scattered outbreaks of measles
 
06:04:40.948 --> 06:04:40.958 align:start position:0%
because of inadequate vaccination rates
 
06:04:42.470 --> 06:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
and they don't have to get below 70
 
06:04:45.030 --> 06:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
because measles is highly contagious and
 
06:04:46.788 --> 06:04:46.798 align:start position:0%
if you just have a relatively low
 
06:04:48.070 --> 06:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
vaccination rate you can have an
 
06:04:48.080 --> 06:04:49.510 align:start position:0%
vaccination rate you can have an
outbreak

06:04:49.510 --> 06:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
outbreak
 
06:04:51.270 --> 06:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
so yes one could argue that a parent
 
06:04:52.788 --> 06:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
should be able to make this decision for
 
06:04:54.070 --> 06:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
their own child
 
06:04:55.510 --> 06:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
but the difficulty is that their
 
06:04:57.830 --> 06:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
decisions that decision does not just
 
06:04:57.840 --> 06:04:58.788 align:start position:0%
decisions that decision does not just
affect

06:04:58.788 --> 06:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
affect
 
06:05:00.948 --> 06:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
their child
 
06:05:03.430 --> 06:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
it affects other children
 
06:05:05.670 --> 06:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
they need to accept the responsibility
 
06:05:07.990 --> 06:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
that their unvaccinated child may infect
 
06:05:08.000 --> 06:05:08.948 align:start position:0%
that their unvaccinated child may infect
another

06:05:08.948 --> 06:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
another
 
06:05:10.868 --> 06:05:10.878 align:start position:0%
vulnerable child
 
06:05:13.190 --> 06:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
in the school because a high level of
 
06:05:15.270 --> 06:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
vaccination is very important to protect
 
06:05:17.510 --> 06:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
those vulnerable individuals who are
 
06:05:20.230 --> 06:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
medically unable to be vaccinated
 
06:05:22.548 --> 06:05:22.558 align:start position:0%
and those who are immunosuppressed
 
06:05:24.070 --> 06:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
and may not be able to mount a good
 
06:05:26.150 --> 06:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
response either to a vaccine or
 
06:05:28.150 --> 06:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately to an infection
 
06:05:30.070 --> 06:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
so the exempted child would place others
 
06:05:31.270 --> 06:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
at risk
 
06:05:33.430 --> 06:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
now there's an occasional rare exemption
 
06:05:35.670 --> 06:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
because of
 
06:05:37.990 --> 06:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
religion or because of medical that's
 
06:05:39.590 --> 06:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
not a problem but if we open up the door
 
06:05:41.590 --> 06:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
and allow lots of exemptions it could be
 
06:05:42.708 --> 06:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
06:05:44.948 --> 06:05:44.958 align:start position:0%
and that's what i'm concerned about
 
06:05:46.868 --> 06:05:46.878 align:start position:0%
i should mention that dr lynn then
 
06:05:48.868 --> 06:05:48.878 align:start position:0%
painter a retired physician in concord
 
06:05:50.548 --> 06:05:50.558 align:start position:0%
wanted to be here to testify and gave me
 
06:05:52.548 --> 06:05:52.558 align:start position:0%
permission to tell their story
 
06:05:54.948 --> 06:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
he noted and i did provide this to you
 
06:05:56.868 --> 06:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
on the testimony quote during my
 
06:05:58.548 --> 06:05:58.558 align:start position:0%
training i spent time in bangladesh for
 
06:06:00.628 --> 06:06:00.638 align:start position:0%
basic immune immunizations available to
 
06:06:02.788 --> 06:06:02.798 align:start position:0%
every american were unavailable
 
06:06:04.788 --> 06:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
i observed children literally dying of
 
06:06:07.830 --> 06:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
preventable infectious diseases such as
 
06:06:09.670 --> 06:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
tetanus it was a gruesome and
 
06:06:12.230 --> 06:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
unforgettable experience this bill opens
 
06:06:13.990 --> 06:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
the door for a return to earlier times
 
06:06:16.230 --> 06:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
in the u.s when infectious diseases such
 
06:06:18.150 --> 06:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
as diphtheria whooping cough scarlet
 
06:06:21.510 --> 06:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
fever and polio were dreaded scourges
 
06:06:23.110 --> 06:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
mandatory school vaccination
 
06:06:25.830 --> 06:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
vaccinations have served us so well
 
06:06:28.628 --> 06:06:28.638 align:start position:0%
that these diseases are now uncommon
 
06:06:30.628 --> 06:06:30.638 align:start position:0%
and many of us have forgotten that
 
06:06:32.628 --> 06:06:32.638 align:start position:0%
childhood deaths were commonplace in the
 
06:06:35.030 --> 06:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
era before vaccines were widespread and
 
06:06:36.548 --> 06:06:36.558 align:start position:0%
if you do want to remember go for a walk
 
06:06:38.708 --> 06:06:38.718 align:start position:0%
in an old cemetery
 
06:06:40.070 --> 06:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
so i am concerned
 
06:06:42.150 --> 06:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
that the reason for our good rate is our
 
06:06:43.670 --> 06:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
current law
 
06:06:45.910 --> 06:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
and that weakening this with making
 
06:06:47.670 --> 06:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
exemptions just
 
06:06:49.030 --> 06:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
basically filling out a form and not
 
06:06:51.510 --> 06:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
having to have any evaluation medically
 
06:06:53.350 --> 06:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
or any attestation as to why you
 
06:06:55.110 --> 06:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
conscientiously object
 
06:06:57.670 --> 06:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh we'll potentially drop our
 
06:06:59.750 --> 06:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
vaccination rate quite a bit and that
 
06:07:01.350 --> 06:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
will take us potentially back to the
 
06:07:02.788 --> 06:07:02.798 align:start position:0%
18th century
 
06:07:05.190 --> 06:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
and move this to a third world status of
 
06:07:08.070 --> 06:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
disease and suffering so i don't i do
 
06:07:09.670 --> 06:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
not really favor this bill thank you
 
06:07:11.670 --> 06:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
very much any questions for the
 
06:07:11.680 --> 06:07:15.350 align:start position:0%
very much any questions for the
representative

06:07:15.350 --> 06:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:19.350 --> 06:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:21.430 --> 06:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
representative acton
 
06:07:24.150 --> 06:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh thank you uh
 
06:07:26.390 --> 06:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
06:07:26.400 --> 06:07:28.868 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
the

06:07:28.868 --> 06:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:28.878 --> 06:07:30.070 align:start position:0%
 
to

06:07:30.070 --> 06:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:07:32.548 --> 06:07:32.558 align:start position:0%
to get a to take a vaccine i i think
 
06:07:32.558 --> 06:07:33.830 align:start position:0%
to get a to take a vaccine i i think
requires

06:07:33.830 --> 06:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
requires
 
06:07:36.548 --> 06:07:36.558 align:start position:0%
education and informed consent it seems
 
06:07:38.868 --> 06:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
as though we've moved away from
 
06:07:38.878 --> 06:07:39.990 align:start position:0%
as though we've moved away from
from

06:07:39.990 --> 06:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:07:42.390 --> 06:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
convincing people to compelling people
 
06:07:44.868 --> 06:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
how do how do we get back to
 
06:07:47.270 --> 06:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
convincing educating and making informed
 
06:07:49.430 --> 06:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
decisions rather than just pure force
 
06:07:52.310 --> 06:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
which isn't working out too well
 
06:07:55.190 --> 06:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
well actually i come back to precisely
 
06:07:57.190 --> 06:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
what representative ling pointed out in
 
06:07:58.628 --> 06:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
our part one article three of the
 
06:08:00.310 --> 06:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
constitution that when men had turned to
 
06:08:01.670 --> 06:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
a state of society they just read up
 
06:08:03.510 --> 06:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
some of their natural rights to that
 
06:08:05.030 --> 06:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
society in order to
 
06:08:07.110 --> 06:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
guarantee their to ensure the protection
 
06:08:08.390 --> 06:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
of others
 
06:08:10.150 --> 06:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
and that's the whole point it is really
 
06:08:10.160 --> 06:08:10.948 align:start position:0%
and that's the whole point it is really
to

06:08:10.948 --> 06:08:10.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:08:13.030 --> 06:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
to help protect others as well and
 
06:08:14.548 --> 06:08:14.558 align:start position:0%
that's the only reason that's why we
 
06:08:16.070 --> 06:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
don't mandated
 
06:08:17.430 --> 06:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
vaccinations for example for
 
06:08:19.350 --> 06:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
non-communicable diseases and that is in
 
06:08:21.670 --> 06:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
statute that we do not mandate
 
06:08:23.190 --> 06:08:23.200 align:start position:0%
vaccinations for non-communicable
 
06:08:23.200 --> 06:08:25.110 align:start position:0%
vaccinations for non-communicable
diseases

06:08:25.110 --> 06:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
06:08:27.030 --> 06:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
that makes good sense but again if you
 
06:08:28.628 --> 06:08:28.638 align:start position:0%
have a communicable disease you can
 
06:08:31.030 --> 06:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
therefore transmit to another person
 
06:08:33.190 --> 06:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
you are your decision not to
 
06:08:34.628 --> 06:08:34.638 align:start position:0%
affects others and if we're going to
 
06:08:36.788 --> 06:08:36.798 align:start position:0%
enter in society we may have to give up
 
06:08:38.470 --> 06:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
some of those rights but i agree with
 
06:08:40.390 --> 06:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
you about informed consent that is a
 
06:08:43.350 --> 06:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
very important part and it is actually
 
06:08:45.190 --> 06:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
i mean when i got the covet vaccine i
 
06:08:46.548 --> 06:08:46.558 align:start position:0%
sort of had to go through
 
06:08:48.708 --> 06:08:48.718 align:start position:0%
a informed consent now most the time
 
06:08:50.868 --> 06:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
people don't spend much time on it i
 
06:08:50.878 --> 06:08:52.830 align:start position:0%
people don't spend much time on it i
agree

06:08:52.830 --> 06:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
agree
 
06:08:52.840 --> 06:08:54.628 align:start position:0%
agree
representative

06:08:54.628 --> 06:08:54.638 align:start position:0%

cushman
 
06:08:58.708 --> 06:08:58.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
06:09:00.310 --> 06:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
representative kanark
 
06:09:00.320 --> 06:09:01.190 align:start position:0%
representative kanark
uh

06:09:01.190 --> 06:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:09:04.390 --> 06:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
my question is you mentioned how
 
06:09:06.470 --> 06:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
you keep saying how you know
 
06:09:09.350 --> 06:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
if we don't require vaccines
 
06:09:11.590 --> 06:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
you know we're putting up other people's
 
06:09:13.590 --> 06:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
we're putting children of
 
06:09:15.270 --> 06:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
families who do choose to vaccinate or
 
06:09:18.230 --> 06:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
maybe they can't vaccinate because of
 
06:09:19.910 --> 06:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
a medical reason
 
06:09:21.750 --> 06:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
at risk
 
06:09:21.760 --> 06:09:23.030 align:start position:0%
at risk
but

06:09:23.030 --> 06:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:09:25.670 --> 06:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
you could say the inverse of that where
 
06:09:28.390 --> 06:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
mandating that kids get these vaccines
 
06:09:30.230 --> 06:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
is still putting people's children at
 
06:09:32.470 --> 06:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
risk so
 
06:09:34.310 --> 06:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you think that the best
 
06:09:36.708 --> 06:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
possible solution to that because
 
06:09:39.750 --> 06:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
there's risks on both sides is to allow
 
06:09:42.230 --> 06:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
the parents to choose
 
06:09:43.670 --> 06:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
actually your point is exactly well
 
06:09:47.190 --> 06:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
taken that is that you are by mandating
 
06:09:48.868 --> 06:09:48.878 align:start position:0%
placing some other children at risk but
 
06:09:50.070 --> 06:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
you have to look at then the overall
 
06:09:52.470 --> 06:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
risk benefit analysis and we
 
06:09:54.470 --> 06:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
those do still end up being in favor of
 
06:09:56.788 --> 06:09:56.798 align:start position:0%
vaccination rather than in favor of not
 
06:09:58.470 --> 06:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
vaccination for these kind of
 
06:09:59.910 --> 06:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
well-established and again that's why
 
06:10:01.990 --> 06:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
i'm glad koben's not in here because i'm
 
06:10:04.070 --> 06:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
not so sure that it does meet that
 
06:10:06.708 --> 06:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
criteria for that necessarily
 
06:10:06.718 --> 06:10:07.750 align:start position:0%
criteria for that necessarily
follow-up

06:10:07.750 --> 06:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:10:09.670 --> 06:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:10:11.910 --> 06:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
i understand you're you're alluding to
 
06:10:13.750 --> 06:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
an aggregate greater benefit to
 
06:10:15.830 --> 06:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
vaccination but
 
06:10:19.350 --> 06:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about individuals
 
06:10:22.150 --> 06:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
if if a person's child ends up vaccine
 
06:10:22.160 --> 06:10:23.110 align:start position:0%
if if a person's child ends up vaccine
injured

06:10:23.110 --> 06:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
injured
 
06:10:25.910 --> 06:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
you know that that's a severe impact to
 
06:10:28.390 --> 06:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
their family you know that's
 
06:10:30.470 --> 06:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
could potentially alter the course of
 
06:10:32.230 --> 06:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
the rest of their lives
 
06:10:32.240 --> 06:10:33.510 align:start position:0%
the rest of their lives
so

06:10:33.510 --> 06:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:10:35.830 --> 06:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
06:10:37.750 --> 06:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be
 
06:10:39.430 --> 06:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
justified to
 
06:10:41.990 --> 06:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
coerce or force or you know make it
 
06:10:43.590 --> 06:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
difficult for someone to make that
 
06:10:46.628 --> 06:10:46.638 align:start position:0%
decision for their family do you follow
 
06:10:48.470 --> 06:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
yes i mean i agree that it shouldn't be
 
06:10:49.910 --> 06:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
overly difficult i think what we
 
06:10:52.310 --> 06:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
currently have is perfectly satisfactory
 
06:10:55.270 --> 06:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
because it has a bar but the bar is but
 
06:10:56.868 --> 06:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
there are exemptions
 
06:10:58.390 --> 06:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
that you have things you have to do but
 
06:10:59.350 --> 06:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
06:11:01.270 --> 06:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
it's not that high a bar i mean i think
 
06:11:02.628 --> 06:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
i could agree with perhaps getting rid
 
06:11:04.310 --> 06:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
of the notary that would not be such a
 
06:11:05.830 --> 06:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
crazy idea that could that would be
 
06:11:08.070 --> 06:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
pretty clean um but i think that if
 
06:11:09.830 --> 06:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to claim a medical it's it
 
06:11:11.750 --> 06:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
should have some kind of documentation
 
06:11:13.590 --> 06:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
if you're going to claim religious it
 
06:11:16.070 --> 06:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
should be a consistent uh belief and not
 
06:11:17.750 --> 06:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
something that's capricious and again
 
06:11:19.910 --> 06:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
conscience subjection just means i don't
 
06:11:22.150 --> 06:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
want it so i think that's a little bit
 
06:11:22.160 --> 06:11:23.590 align:start position:0%
want it so i think that's a little bit
different

06:11:23.590 --> 06:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
different
 
06:11:25.270 --> 06:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
but the other thing i do also come back
 
06:11:26.788 --> 06:11:26.798 align:start position:0%
to what i said in the testimony of the
 
06:11:29.030 --> 06:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
previous bill it is critical that we do
 
06:11:31.830 --> 06:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
understand and remember that the
 
06:11:34.390 --> 06:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
risks of vaccines are often
 
06:11:36.708 --> 06:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
wildly inflated by spouting various
 
06:11:39.030 --> 06:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
numbers that are just simply reports
 
06:11:41.190 --> 06:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
they are not necessarily causal and
 
06:11:43.190 --> 06:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
that's why any report needs to be looked
 
06:11:45.270 --> 06:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
into carefully so we do have to balance
 
06:11:48.548 --> 06:11:48.558 align:start position:0%
that and that's really why we're here to
 
06:11:50.150 --> 06:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
make that decision about what is the
 
06:11:51.750 --> 06:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
best thing because i can only kind of
 
06:11:53.670 --> 06:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
address my worries about the science
 
06:11:55.670 --> 06:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
what we do as a group is why we work as
 
06:11:57.670 --> 06:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
a committee and as a legislature because
 
06:12:02.628 --> 06:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:04.948 --> 06:12:04.958 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
06:12:07.830 --> 06:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
we've heard from the bill's proponents a
 
06:12:09.990 --> 06:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
proponent and
 
06:12:12.788 --> 06:12:12.798 align:start position:0%
a learned expert for the other side
 
06:12:15.110 --> 06:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
and now we have two things in play a
 
06:12:17.990 --> 06:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
myth full of pink cards and snow coming
 
06:12:18.000 --> 06:12:18.948 align:start position:0%
myth full of pink cards and snow coming
down

06:12:18.948 --> 06:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
down
 
06:12:20.628 --> 06:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
so we're going to go to our two-minute
 
06:12:20.638 --> 06:12:21.990 align:start position:0%
so we're going to go to our two-minute
rule

06:12:21.990 --> 06:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
rule
 
06:12:23.590 --> 06:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
and you can do it
 
06:12:25.590 --> 06:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
people caught on very well in the last
 
06:12:25.600 --> 06:12:26.788 align:start position:0%
people caught on very well in the last
hearing

06:12:26.788 --> 06:12:26.798 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
06:12:29.110 --> 06:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes dr william

one of the main tenets of organization
 
06:13:10.240 --> 06:13:11.350 align:start position:0%
one of the main tenets of organization
is

06:13:11.350 --> 06:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:13:13.350 --> 06:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
using the best evidence possible to
 
06:13:13.360 --> 06:13:14.390 align:start position:0%
using the best evidence possible to
determine

06:13:14.390 --> 06:13:14.400 align:start position:0%

our health care
we

06:13:17.910 --> 06:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:13:19.990 --> 06:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
support immunization of all children and
 
06:13:21.430 --> 06:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
adult and adults according to the
 
06:13:24.948 --> 06:13:24.958 align:start position:0%

our chapter as well as the national
 
06:13:35.760 --> 06:13:37.670 align:start position:0%
our chapter as well as the national
organization

06:13:37.670 --> 06:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
organization
 
06:13:40.868 --> 06:13:40.878 align:start position:0%
is opposed to hb 1035 as it's counter to
 
06:13:42.070 --> 06:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
our goal
 
06:13:44.470 --> 06:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
of eliminating non-medical exemptions
 
06:13:46.628 --> 06:13:46.638 align:start position:0%
for vaccines which i know is maybe a
 
06:13:48.788 --> 06:13:48.798 align:start position:0%
little controversial but we certainly
 
06:13:50.708 --> 06:13:50.718 align:start position:0%
don't want to see it expanded for the
 
06:13:52.868 --> 06:13:52.878 align:start position:0%
reasons that dr knurk
 
06:13:55.190 --> 06:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
has already alluded to which is that
 
06:13:58.230 --> 06:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
vaccines have saved millions of lives
 
06:14:00.708 --> 06:14:00.718 align:start position:0%
and we we have seen
 
06:14:02.788 --> 06:14:02.798 align:start position:0%
in areas where
 
06:14:04.470 --> 06:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
there are
 
06:14:06.470 --> 06:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
lower vaccine rates or where groups of
 
06:14:08.390 --> 06:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
people have opted not to vaccine we've
 
06:14:10.310 --> 06:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
seen outbreaks of measles
 
06:14:11.910 --> 06:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:14:13.350 --> 06:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
we really just don't want to see it go
 
06:14:15.670 --> 06:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
back that way
 
06:14:15.680 --> 06:14:16.470 align:start position:0%
back that way
while

06:14:16.470 --> 06:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
while
 
06:14:19.590 --> 06:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
right now the the level of
 
06:14:22.470 --> 06:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
of exemptions is very low um
 
06:14:30.230 --> 06:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:32.868 --> 06:14:32.878 align:start position:0%
what's the word i want movement that's
 
06:14:34.230 --> 06:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
going on
 
06:14:36.548 --> 06:14:36.558 align:start position:0%
we would expect to see an increasing
 
06:14:38.788 --> 06:14:38.798 align:start position:0%
number of unvaccinated people it's the
 
06:14:41.750 --> 06:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
number has quadrupled since about 2000
 
06:14:43.990 --> 06:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
and if it keeps going at that rate
 
06:14:46.150 --> 06:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
in in not that long a time we might see
 
06:14:49.590 --> 06:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
a very um high rate of
 
06:14:51.830 --> 06:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated people and increases in
 
06:14:51.840 --> 06:14:53.270 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated people and increases in
diseases

06:14:53.270 --> 06:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
06:14:55.510 --> 06:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
and i've got 15 seconds to conclude and
 
06:14:57.750 --> 06:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
so i will just conclude by saying so we
 
06:15:00.390 --> 06:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
are opposed to this bill
 
06:15:04.948 --> 06:15:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:07.590 --> 06:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
we welcome back uh trisha tilley and
 
06:15:16.548 --> 06:15:16.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:18.548 --> 06:15:18.558 align:start position:0%
the relative height of the chair has
 
06:15:22.310 --> 06:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:23.830 --> 06:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you again my name is patricia

department of health and human services
 
06:15:30.708 --> 06:15:30.718 align:start position:0%
i am aware of this very small chair and
 
06:15:33.030 --> 06:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
with me i have amir mccurry who is the
 
06:15:34.708 --> 06:15:34.718 align:start position:0%
chief of immunization
 
06:15:36.230 --> 06:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman pearson and
 
06:15:37.510 --> 06:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
06:15:38.788 --> 06:15:38.798 align:start position:0%
on me and marie mccary i'm the
 
06:15:40.948 --> 06:15:40.958 align:start position:0%
immunization section chief of the new
 
06:15:42.548 --> 06:15:42.558 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of health and human
 
06:15:44.310 --> 06:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
services public health
 
06:15:45.750 --> 06:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
trying to talk fast to get my two
 
06:15:46.868 --> 06:15:46.878 align:start position:0%
minutes in
 
06:15:48.628 --> 06:15:48.638 align:start position:0%
um so thank you very much we have
 
06:15:52.230 --> 06:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
submitted this testimony um we are in
 
06:15:55.190 --> 06:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
opposition of hb 1035 as this bill
 
06:15:56.628 --> 06:15:56.638 align:start position:0%
proposes to loosen the new hampshire
 
06:15:58.230 --> 06:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
school and child care immunization
 
06:16:00.310 --> 06:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
requirements which in turn will decrease
 
06:16:02.470 --> 06:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
the vaccination rates among children and
 
06:16:05.270 --> 06:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
put children unnecessarily at risk
 
06:16:07.430 --> 06:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
of the vaccine-preventable diseases that
 
06:16:10.548 --> 06:16:10.558 align:start position:0%
cause illness disability and death
 
06:16:12.628 --> 06:16:12.638 align:start position:0%
as we mentioned earlier today new
 
06:16:15.190 --> 06:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire has significantly fewer
 
06:16:17.030 --> 06:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
vaccines which are required compared to
 
06:16:19.910 --> 06:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
other states there are 16 diseases that
 
06:16:22.150 --> 06:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
are recommended by the acip which is the
 
06:16:23.990 --> 06:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
advisory committee on immunization
 
06:16:26.390 --> 06:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
practices and new hampshire has
 
06:16:28.470 --> 06:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
immunization requirements for 10 of
 
06:16:30.070 --> 06:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
those diseases
 
06:16:31.350 --> 06:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
we do allow for the medical and
 
06:16:33.590 --> 06:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions
 
06:16:34.948 --> 06:16:34.958 align:start position:0%
for these
 
06:16:38.548 --> 06:16:38.558 align:start position:0%
school and child care immunization
 
06:16:38.558 --> 06:16:39.750 align:start position:0%
school and child care immunization
requirements

06:16:39.750 --> 06:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
06:16:42.708 --> 06:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
but we do feel as though we're in line
 
06:16:44.708 --> 06:16:44.718 align:start position:0%
with many of the leading medical
 
06:16:46.548 --> 06:16:46.558 align:start position:0%
organizations such as the american
 
06:16:48.868 --> 06:16:48.878 align:start position:0%
academy of pediatrics american college
 
06:16:51.030 --> 06:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
of obstetricians and gynecologists and
 
06:16:53.910 --> 06:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
the american medical association
 
06:16:56.788 --> 06:16:56.798 align:start position:0%
in opposition to loosening the school
 
06:16:56.798 --> 06:16:58.390 align:start position:0%
in opposition to loosening the school
requirements

06:16:58.390 --> 06:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
06:16:58.400 --> 06:16:59.830 align:start position:0%
requirements
and

06:16:59.830 --> 06:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:17:01.350 --> 06:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
we are also feeling as though the
 
06:17:04.548 --> 06:17:04.558 align:start position:0%
department has a goal of having that
 
06:17:07.350 --> 06:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
balance of individual individual choice
 
06:17:09.270 --> 06:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
and public health protection we feel as
 
06:17:11.830 --> 06:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
though allowing the medical exemption
 
06:17:14.070 --> 06:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me allowing the religious
 
06:17:16.548 --> 06:17:16.558 align:start position:0%
exemption allows for that
 
06:17:18.390 --> 06:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
historically new hampshire we have
 
06:17:20.548 --> 06:17:20.558 align:start position:0%
experienced a less than five percent
 
06:17:22.868 --> 06:17:22.878 align:start position:0%
exemption rate we are concerned about
 
06:17:25.350 --> 06:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
the potential of the expansion of the
 
06:17:27.510 --> 06:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
non-medical exemptions
 
06:17:30.708 --> 06:17:30.718 align:start position:0%
as indicated by other states
 
06:17:33.270 --> 06:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
new idaho for instance some counties
 
06:17:36.150 --> 06:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
have had a 27 percent
 
06:17:37.750 --> 06:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
height of
 
06:17:39.430 --> 06:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
exemption rates so that would be very
 
06:17:41.430 --> 06:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
concerning for new hampshire
 
06:17:44.390 --> 06:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
we feel as though 10 35 would undermine
 
06:17:46.310 --> 06:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
the protection from vaccine preventable
 
06:17:48.390 --> 06:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
diseases that new hampshire currently
 
06:17:51.030 --> 06:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
experiences and if i could just clarify
 
06:17:53.750 --> 06:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
one point that was made earlier today
 
06:17:55.910 --> 06:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
the state does not receive any personal
 
06:17:57.910 --> 06:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
information about individuals who submit
 
06:18:00.150 --> 06:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
religious or medical exemptions schools
 
06:18:01.910 --> 06:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
do report aggregate numbers to the
 
06:18:01.920 --> 06:18:03.110 align:start position:0%
do report aggregate numbers to the
department

06:18:03.110 --> 06:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
department
 
06:18:05.110 --> 06:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
hence the privacy issues that were
 
06:18:07.030 --> 06:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier today
 
06:18:08.310 --> 06:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
are not
 
06:18:10.788 --> 06:18:10.798 align:start position:0%
considered to be an issue of concern
 
06:18:13.430 --> 06:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
because we have no data point on this
 
06:18:20.230 --> 06:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:21.590 --> 06:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
well done
 
06:18:25.910 --> 06:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
any questions representative shapiro
 
06:18:28.548 --> 06:18:28.558 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman um i was just
 
06:18:30.470 --> 06:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
wondering about when you cited
 
06:18:32.548 --> 06:18:32.558 align:start position:0%
statistics in idaho
 
06:18:32.558 --> 06:18:33.510 align:start position:0%
statistics in idaho
um

06:18:33.510 --> 06:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:34.788 --> 06:18:34.798 align:start position:0%
which was a
 
06:18:36.948 --> 06:18:36.958 align:start position:0%
significantly larger number of
 
06:18:40.150 --> 06:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated children did that
 
06:18:42.948 --> 06:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
did that relate at all to an expansion
 
06:18:45.430 --> 06:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
of exemptions
 
06:18:47.270 --> 06:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
idaho is one of those states where they
 
06:18:50.070 --> 06:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
do allow the conscientious objection
 
06:18:52.150 --> 06:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
overall their state is a little bit over
 
06:18:53.590 --> 06:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
7 percent
 
06:18:56.548 --> 06:18:56.558 align:start position:0%
however their counties specific data
 
06:18:59.510 --> 06:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
do have pockets where 27
 
06:19:02.310 --> 06:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
are considered to be having exemptions
 
06:19:03.990 --> 06:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
and that would be highly concerning for
 
06:19:05.190 --> 06:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
06:19:07.510 --> 06:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
and again this um this data was seen
 
06:19:09.510 --> 06:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
when we they went to the expansion to a
 
06:19:11.750 --> 06:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
conscientious objection and where they
 
06:19:13.830 --> 06:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
really saw that increase was incoming
 
06:19:16.628 --> 06:19:16.638 align:start position:0%
kindergartners so that that is something
 
06:19:18.548 --> 06:19:18.558 align:start position:0%
that we're very concerned about thank
 
06:19:20.628 --> 06:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
you which seemed to be that would be
 
06:19:23.030 --> 06:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
covert driven i should assume this
 
06:19:24.948 --> 06:19:24.958 align:start position:0%
happened before covet
 
06:19:28.070 --> 06:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
then i assume wrong thank you
 
06:19:29.350 --> 06:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
did you want to follow up sir
 
06:19:31.830 --> 06:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
06:19:34.708 --> 06:19:34.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um this increase
 
06:19:34.718 --> 06:19:35.990 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um this increase
in

06:19:35.990 --> 06:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:19:37.510 --> 06:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
the exemptions
 
06:19:40.708 --> 06:19:40.718 align:start position:0%
what was the resulting increase or was
 
06:19:43.750 --> 06:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
there an increase in the actual illness
 
06:19:43.760 --> 06:19:45.350 align:start position:0%
there an increase in the actual illness
count

06:19:45.350 --> 06:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
count
 
06:19:47.190 --> 06:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
we do have studies that talk about
 
06:19:49.750 --> 06:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
recent outbreaks of measles pertussis in
 
06:19:49.760 --> 06:19:51.030 align:start position:0%
recent outbreaks of measles pertussis in
varicella

06:19:51.030 --> 06:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
varicella
 
06:19:55.190 --> 06:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
for example in 2019 a total of 1249
 
06:19:57.350 --> 06:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
measle cases and 22 measle outbreaks
 
06:19:59.750 --> 06:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
were reported in the united states this
 
06:19:59.760 --> 06:20:01.510 align:start position:0%
were reported in the united states this
represents

06:20:01.510 --> 06:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
represents
 
06:20:02.628 --> 06:20:02.638 align:start position:0%
the most
 
06:20:05.030 --> 06:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
u.s cases in a single year and the
 
06:20:07.590 --> 06:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
second highest number reported outbreaks
 
06:20:09.430 --> 06:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
annually since measles were declared
 
06:20:13.430 --> 06:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
elimination in u.s in 2000. follow-up
 
06:20:17.670 --> 06:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:19.430 --> 06:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
how do you
 
06:20:21.670 --> 06:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
what was the exact result from the
 
06:20:25.670 --> 06:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
places that increased the exemptions
 
06:20:28.868 --> 06:20:28.878 align:start position:0%
that's not national data that has to be
 
06:20:31.510 --> 06:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
specific to where the exemptions
 
06:20:31.520 --> 06:20:32.708 align:start position:0%
specific to where the exemptions
increased

06:20:32.708 --> 06:20:32.718 align:start position:0%
increased
 
06:20:34.070 --> 06:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
06:20:36.230 --> 06:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
and those studies
 
06:20:38.310 --> 06:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
talk more about the
 
06:20:40.628 --> 06:20:40.638 align:start position:0%
vaccination status and numbers of
 
06:20:42.708 --> 06:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
children that are vaccinated it doesn't
 
06:20:45.270 --> 06:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily dictate exemption or
 
06:20:47.830 --> 06:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
non-exemption for states
 
06:20:50.230 --> 06:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
but where we see the pockets of
 
06:20:52.548 --> 06:20:52.558 align:start position:0%
outbreaks occurring are the pockets
 
06:20:52.558 --> 06:20:53.430 align:start position:0%
outbreaks occurring are the pockets
where

06:20:53.430 --> 06:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
where
 
06:20:56.948 --> 06:20:56.958 align:start position:0%
the exemptions are likely to occur
 
06:20:59.590 --> 06:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
because of the relationship of decreased
 
06:21:02.830 --> 06:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:05.350 --> 06:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
06:21:07.030 --> 06:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you for taking
 
06:21:10.548 --> 06:21:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:12.788 --> 06:21:12.798 align:start position:0%
uh i'm gonna give you a scenario i love
 
06:21:14.948 --> 06:21:14.958 align:start position:0%
to give scenarios everyone in here knows
 
06:21:16.230 --> 06:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
this so
 
06:21:20.150 --> 06:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's my thing um
 
06:21:20.160 --> 06:21:21.990 align:start position:0%
it's my thing um
a

06:21:21.990 --> 06:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:21:25.030 --> 06:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
a per a family
 
06:21:25.040 --> 06:21:26.230 align:start position:0%
a per a family
atheist

06:21:26.230 --> 06:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
atheist
 
06:21:27.750 --> 06:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
no religious
 
06:21:31.030 --> 06:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
feelings whatsoever about anything
 
06:21:32.390 --> 06:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
they hear that
 
06:21:34.948 --> 06:21:34.958 align:start position:0%
there is something in the vaccine in the
 
06:21:37.110 --> 06:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
in the makeup of it
 
06:21:40.070 --> 06:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's associated with aborted fetal
 
06:21:40.080 --> 06:21:41.430 align:start position:0%
that's associated with aborted fetal
cells

06:21:41.430 --> 06:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
cells
 
06:21:43.670 --> 06:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
and they don't believe in abortion
 
06:21:47.430 --> 06:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
they have a moral
 
06:21:49.350 --> 06:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
feeling but not based on any kind of
 
06:21:49.360 --> 06:21:51.430 align:start position:0%
feeling but not based on any kind of
religion

06:21:51.430 --> 06:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
religion
 
06:21:53.910 --> 06:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
where do they fit it's not a religious
 
06:21:53.920 --> 06:21:55.670 align:start position:0%
where do they fit it's not a religious
exemption

06:21:55.670 --> 06:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
06:22:02.310 --> 06:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:05.030 --> 06:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that's where i think
 
06:22:06.868 --> 06:22:06.878 align:start position:0%
that's where the
 
06:22:09.830 --> 06:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the bill is trying to
 
06:22:12.150 --> 06:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
allow those people
 
06:22:14.628 --> 06:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
um to fit in
 
06:22:16.628 --> 06:22:16.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that question
 
06:22:19.190 --> 06:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
so you're correct um we currently have a
 
06:22:21.030 --> 06:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
religious exemption and we currently
 
06:22:23.270 --> 06:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
have a medical exemption and under that
 
06:22:24.948 --> 06:22:24.958 align:start position:0%
religious exemption there's very little
 
06:22:26.788 --> 06:22:26.798 align:start position:0%
information that's provided it's the
 
06:22:28.788 --> 06:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
child's name the parent's name date of
 
06:22:31.350 --> 06:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
birth and a notary signature and that's
 
06:22:34.150 --> 06:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
what's provided we understand that there
 
06:22:35.750 --> 06:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
are folks who
 
06:22:37.190 --> 06:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
take issue with the fact that it is
 
06:22:38.708 --> 06:22:38.718 align:start position:0%
called a religious exemption for the
 
06:22:40.948 --> 06:22:40.958 align:start position:0%
very reasons that you've described i
 
06:22:43.270 --> 06:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
think what we are concerned about is the
 
06:22:46.230 --> 06:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
overall opening and widening of the door
 
06:22:48.150 --> 06:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
for conscientious objections or
 
06:22:50.548 --> 06:22:50.558 align:start position:0%
otherwise reducing any sort of
 
06:22:54.230 --> 06:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
requirements within our schools
 
06:22:56.468 --> 06:22:56.478 align:start position:0%
so that we can better protect our
 
06:22:58.070 --> 06:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
concern is that we want to better
 
06:23:00.150 --> 06:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
protect the health of all the children
 
06:23:01.430 --> 06:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
in the in the schools i think
 
06:23:03.510 --> 06:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative kenner did a great job of
 
06:23:06.548 --> 06:23:06.558 align:start position:0%
describing this very fine balance we all
 
06:23:08.708 --> 06:23:08.718 align:start position:0%
enter into especially when we're in a
 
06:23:11.110 --> 06:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
place like a school of protecting our
 
06:23:12.868 --> 06:23:12.878 align:start position:0%
own individual rights and the rights of
 
06:23:15.110 --> 06:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
others in the school as well
 
06:23:19.910 --> 06:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:24.310 --> 06:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:26.548 --> 06:23:26.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
06:23:26.558 --> 06:23:28.150 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
so

06:23:28.150 --> 06:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:23:30.230 --> 06:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
just so you know i i'm going to give a
 
06:23:31.430 --> 06:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
definition that i'm going to ask a
 
06:23:33.910 --> 06:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
question an unalienable right is that
 
06:23:37.670 --> 06:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
which cannot be given away or taken away
 
06:23:39.590 --> 06:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
governmentally at least
 
06:23:42.150 --> 06:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
and it's not given by government so
 
06:23:44.070 --> 06:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
government can't take it away
 
06:23:46.548 --> 06:23:46.558 align:start position:0%
and then yes we have a balance we give
 
06:23:49.830 --> 06:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
up some of our rights however
 
06:23:52.390 --> 06:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
article 4 which is constitutional and
 
06:23:54.868 --> 06:23:54.878 align:start position:0%
that's that's our new hampshire state
 
06:23:56.628 --> 06:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
constitution but i know it also exists
 
06:23:59.750 --> 06:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
in the uh federal constitution
 
06:24:02.070 --> 06:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
the among the natural rights natural
 
06:24:02.080 --> 06:24:04.310 align:start position:0%
the among the natural rights natural
rights

06:24:04.310 --> 06:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
rights
 
06:24:05.510 --> 06:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
some are
 
06:24:08.390 --> 06:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
in their very na uh nature unalienable
 
06:24:11.350 --> 06:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
or inalienable because no equivalent can
 
06:24:14.310 --> 06:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
be given or received for them of this
 
06:24:16.708 --> 06:24:16.718 align:start position:0%
kind are the rights of conscience and
 
06:24:19.190 --> 06:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
now wouldn't you agree that if someone
 
06:24:21.750 --> 06:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
has a conscientious objection that they
 
06:24:23.670 --> 06:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
have the constitutional right to
 
06:24:27.750 --> 06:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:29.110 --> 06:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question i think
 
06:24:30.948 --> 06:24:30.958 align:start position:0%
again that is a decision for all of you
 
06:24:32.708 --> 06:24:32.718 align:start position:0%
in this committee and our legislature to
 
06:24:34.628 --> 06:24:34.638 align:start position:0%
make the concern that we have within the
 
06:24:36.310 --> 06:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
06:24:38.310 --> 06:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
is protecting the public's health and we
 
06:24:40.548 --> 06:24:40.558 align:start position:0%
do that under the guidance of our state
 
06:24:42.070 --> 06:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
legislature and the policies that we're
 
06:24:44.708 --> 06:24:44.718 align:start position:0%
given thank you very much representative
 
06:24:46.868 --> 06:24:46.878 align:start position:0%
leon thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
06:24:49.270 --> 06:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
for the questions i appreciate that the
 
06:24:50.948 --> 06:24:50.958 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
06:24:53.510 --> 06:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
only gets aggregated data but when
 
06:24:54.868 --> 06:24:54.878 align:start position:0%
you're speaking to that you can't speak
 
06:24:56.468 --> 06:24:56.478 align:start position:0%
to what's collected in the schools or in
 
06:24:59.670 --> 06:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
the department of education correct
 
06:25:02.788 --> 06:25:02.798 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
06:25:06.468 --> 06:25:06.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:10.948 --> 06:25:10.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:13.350 --> 06:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
now we will also hand out a map that we
 
06:25:15.270 --> 06:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
have of all the states that have
 
06:25:16.708 --> 06:25:16.718 align:start position:0%
different exemptions
 
06:25:19.430 --> 06:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
i love maps
 
06:25:24.230 --> 06:25:24.240 align:start position:0%

this year yeah uh
 
06:25:37.750 --> 06:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
from the looks of the empty chairs i
 
06:25:39.190 --> 06:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
don't think there'll be
 
06:25:41.670 --> 06:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
any exact exacting of there will not be
 
06:25:43.830 --> 06:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
any execs so the seed fillers are
 
06:25:47.350 --> 06:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
dismissed may i be excused
 
06:25:47.360 --> 06:25:50.270 align:start position:0%
dismissed may i be excused
absolutely

06:25:50.270 --> 06:25:50.280 align:start position:0%

06:25:57.030 --> 06:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
for those of you in the gallery the
 
06:25:59.430 --> 06:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
chair kept calling people with very
 
06:26:02.548 --> 06:26:02.558 align:start position:0%
clearly franco-american or franco names
 
06:26:04.070 --> 06:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
and they insisted
 
06:26:04.080 --> 06:26:05.830 align:start position:0%
and they insisted
on

06:26:05.830 --> 06:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:26:08.310 --> 06:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
giving american renditions
 
06:26:11.270 --> 06:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
and that's certainly their right but
 
06:26:13.430 --> 06:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
that that's what this little runner is
 
06:26:16.150 --> 06:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
we finally brought in someone who is
 
06:26:18.628 --> 06:26:18.638 align:start position:0%

starbucks
 
06:26:47.440 --> 06:26:48.628 align:start position:0%
starbucks
and

06:26:48.628 --> 06:26:48.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:26:51.430 --> 06:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
they were mandating vaccines at a time
 
06:26:53.910 --> 06:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
and she has a history of seizure
 
06:26:53.920 --> 06:26:55.110 align:start position:0%
and she has a history of seizure
disorder

06:26:55.110 --> 06:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
disorder
 
06:26:57.990 --> 06:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
um she had grand mal seizures growing up
 
06:27:00.628 --> 06:27:00.638 align:start position:0%
um she would have to take like 10 pills
 
06:27:03.430 --> 06:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
a day um it was awful and she remembers
 
06:27:04.868 --> 06:27:04.878 align:start position:0%
it she
 
06:27:04.878 --> 06:27:06.830 align:start position:0%
it she
thankfully

06:27:06.830 --> 06:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
thankfully
 
06:27:09.670 --> 06:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
thankfully um she
 
06:27:13.190 --> 06:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
outgrew them so she's no longer has any
 
06:27:15.990 --> 06:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
criminal seizures however she was
 
06:27:18.310 --> 06:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
petrified to take this vaccine
 
06:27:19.990 --> 06:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
because there's been
 
06:27:22.468 --> 06:27:22.478 align:start position:0%
many neurological disorders
 
06:27:24.628 --> 06:27:24.638 align:start position:0%
that have become affiliated from the
 
06:27:27.590 --> 06:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
adverse effects from the vaccine
 
06:27:29.990 --> 06:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
so she was petrified she was crying she
 
06:27:33.910 --> 06:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:36.070 --> 06:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
i said well get a medical exemption i
 
06:27:38.788 --> 06:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
mean you you have a history of seizures
 
06:27:38.798 --> 06:27:39.590 align:start position:0%
mean you you have a history of seizures
so

06:27:39.590 --> 06:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:27:42.310 --> 06:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
she reached out to her doctor her doctor
 
06:27:44.708 --> 06:27:44.718 align:start position:0%
um said oh i can't give you one
 
06:27:46.948 --> 06:27:46.958 align:start position:0%
and then she reached out to and she's
 
06:27:49.030 --> 06:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
like oh we'll call this person so my
 
06:27:50.788 --> 06:27:50.798 align:start position:0%
daughter called that person oh i don't
 
06:27:52.628 --> 06:27:52.638 align:start position:0%
know why she told me to call me i can't
 
06:27:54.948 --> 06:27:54.958 align:start position:0%
give you one so she reached out to her
 
06:27:56.628 --> 06:27:56.638 align:start position:0%
neurologist that she used to have a
 
06:27:57.750 --> 06:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
while back
 
06:27:59.110 --> 06:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
no answer
 
06:28:01.830 --> 06:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
so this is a thing and then there's this
 
06:28:03.190 --> 06:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
other woman i don't know this woman
 
06:28:05.910 --> 06:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
personally thank god the starbucks said
 
06:28:09.830 --> 06:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
no more maxine mandates they um
 
06:28:11.750 --> 06:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
they don't require anymore she was so
 
06:28:13.110 --> 06:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
happy she didn't have to lose her job
 
06:28:14.468 --> 06:28:14.478 align:start position:0%
because she's going to college as well
 
06:28:16.070 --> 06:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
through them
 
06:28:18.310 --> 06:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
anyway so there's another another woman
 
06:28:19.590 --> 06:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
just real quick there's another woman
 
06:28:21.510 --> 06:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
her husband had
 
06:28:24.390 --> 06:28:24.400 align:start position:0%
got myocarditis from the first shot
 
06:28:24.400 --> 06:28:25.510 align:start position:0%
got myocarditis from the first shot
and

06:28:25.510 --> 06:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:28:28.628 --> 06:28:28.638 align:start position:0%
he went to the um his doctor and asked
 
06:28:31.190 --> 06:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
for a medical exemption
 
06:28:33.910 --> 06:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
and his doctor would not give him one
 
06:28:35.750 --> 06:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:28:37.430 --> 06:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
they reached they
 
06:28:39.510 --> 06:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
well actually it was denied that it was
 
06:28:41.350 --> 06:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
from even the vaccine just real quick it
 
06:28:43.110 --> 06:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
was denied from the vaccine
 
06:28:45.350 --> 06:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:28:47.590 --> 06:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
he he ended up finally finding a doctor
 
06:28:50.150 --> 06:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
that would you know that agreed that it
 
06:28:51.510 --> 06:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
was from the vaccine that causes
 
06:28:51.520 --> 06:28:52.948 align:start position:0%
was from the vaccine that causes
myocarditis

06:28:52.948 --> 06:28:52.958 align:start position:0%
myocarditis
 
06:28:55.830 --> 06:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
however the doctor said
 
06:28:58.548 --> 06:28:58.558 align:start position:0%
my hands are tied i will be investigated
 
06:29:00.310 --> 06:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
these doctors are going to be
 
06:29:02.788 --> 06:29:02.798 align:start position:0%
investigated if they give any medical
 
06:29:02.798 --> 06:29:04.070 align:start position:0%
investigated if they give any medical
exemption

06:29:04.070 --> 06:29:04.080 align:start position:0%

06:29:06.390 --> 06:29:06.400 align:start position:0%

i'm also a parent so i've had the whole
school

06:30:25.510 --> 06:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
school
 
06:30:30.468 --> 06:30:30.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:32.708 --> 06:30:32.718 align:start position:0%
and people
 
06:30:32.718 --> 06:30:33.510 align:start position:0%
and people
are

06:30:33.510 --> 06:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:30:35.670 --> 06:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
in our country
 
06:30:37.910 --> 06:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
wonderfully lucky that
 
06:30:40.788 --> 06:30:40.798 align:start position:0%
we actually have vaccinations
 
06:30:40.798 --> 06:30:41.830 align:start position:0%
we actually have vaccinations
and

06:30:41.830 --> 06:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:30:45.350 --> 06:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
i just i just wanted to say my gosh
 
06:30:47.910 --> 06:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
in the states where they've had pockets
 
06:30:47.920 --> 06:30:48.628 align:start position:0%
in the states where they've had pockets
like

06:30:48.628 --> 06:30:48.638 align:start position:0%
like
 
06:30:51.430 --> 06:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
there's a particular
 
06:30:54.070 --> 06:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
religious group that is very much
 
06:30:58.150 --> 06:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
against vaccines in new york and um
 
06:31:00.230 --> 06:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
and that unfortunately that group also
 
06:31:00.240 --> 06:31:01.350 align:start position:0%
and that unfortunately that group also
got

06:31:01.350 --> 06:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
got
 
06:31:04.310 --> 06:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
quite a lot of measles and so new york
 
06:31:06.628 --> 06:31:06.638 align:start position:0%
as well as five other states actually
 
06:31:09.430 --> 06:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
removed the religious exemption
 
06:31:12.390 --> 06:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
it's just that it's a such a wonderfully
 
06:31:15.430 --> 06:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
infectious disease and
 
06:31:17.430 --> 06:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
with terrible outcomes
 
06:31:17.440 --> 06:31:18.830 align:start position:0%
with terrible outcomes
so

06:31:18.830 --> 06:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:31:22.310 --> 06:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
um i i would really um hope that
 
06:31:25.030 --> 06:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
everybody would vote against this for
 
06:31:27.430 --> 06:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
the vaccines that we've been doing right
 
06:31:27.440 --> 06:31:28.708 align:start position:0%
the vaccines that we've been doing right
along

06:31:28.708 --> 06:31:28.718 align:start position:0%
along
 
06:31:30.020 --> 06:31:30.030 align:start position:0%
we've just been so
 
06:31:30.030 --> 06:31:31.510 align:start position:0%
we've just been so
[Music]

06:31:31.510 --> 06:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:31:34.468 --> 06:31:34.478 align:start position:0%
yeah so lucky to not have the polio not
 
06:31:37.830 --> 06:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
have the measles not have you know
 
06:31:40.310 --> 06:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
what we would otherwise if
 
06:31:42.708 --> 06:31:42.718 align:start position:0%
a number of people start dropping off
 
06:31:45.670 --> 06:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
the list of those vaccinated
 
06:31:47.670 --> 06:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
so that's that's it maybe i finished
 
06:31:49.830 --> 06:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
challenge thank you for coming
 
06:31:51.590 --> 06:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
well thank you for listening i don't
 
06:31:55.750 --> 06:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
know if there's any questions but anyway
 
06:31:58.230 --> 06:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes kate fry
 
06:32:01.670 --> 06:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
100 north main street concord which is
 
06:32:08.310 --> 06:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:09.910 --> 06:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for providing that
 
06:32:09.920 --> 06:32:11.510 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for providing that
information

06:32:11.510 --> 06:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:32:13.830 --> 06:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
you filled it out perfectly um good
 
06:32:15.350 --> 06:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
afternoon you've been here once or twice
 
06:32:17.670 --> 06:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
before once or twice yes
 
06:32:19.590 --> 06:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon um i do have written
 
06:32:21.670 --> 06:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
testimony that i will leave with you um
 
06:32:23.030 --> 06:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
my name is kate fry i'm the vice
 
06:32:24.868 --> 06:32:24.878 align:start position:0%
president of advocacy at new futures
 
06:32:26.948 --> 06:32:26.958 align:start position:0%
i'll do my best not to repeat what was
 
06:32:29.110 --> 06:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
said but also hit the highlights and i
 
06:32:31.590 --> 06:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
will probably speak really fast too so
 
06:32:33.510 --> 06:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh new features support public health
 
06:32:36.548 --> 06:32:36.558 align:start position:0%
policy measures that decrease illness
 
06:32:38.310 --> 06:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
including immunizations and programs
 
06:32:39.830 --> 06:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
that ensure equitable and broad
 
06:32:41.830 --> 06:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
distribution of vaccines especially to
 
06:32:41.840 --> 06:32:42.868 align:start position:0%
distribution of vaccines especially to
kids

06:32:42.868 --> 06:32:42.878 align:start position:0%
kids
 
06:32:44.230 --> 06:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
this program new hampshire's
 
06:32:46.628 --> 06:32:46.638 align:start position:0%
immunization children's immune
 
06:32:49.430 --> 06:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
program does just that in new hampshire
 
06:32:51.510 --> 06:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
all children through the age of 18 can
 
06:32:53.670 --> 06:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
receive vaccines at no cost through an
 
06:32:55.110 --> 06:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
innovative program
 
06:32:55.120 --> 06:32:55.910 align:start position:0%
innovative program
that

06:32:55.910 --> 06:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:32:58.788 --> 06:32:58.798 align:start position:0%
combines general funds state funds and
 
06:33:01.910 --> 06:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
contributions from insurance companies
 
06:33:03.990 --> 06:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
this model allows
 
06:33:06.390 --> 06:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
every child to receive a vaccine free of
 
06:33:08.468 --> 06:33:08.478 align:start position:0%
charge in the child immunization
 
06:33:10.230 --> 06:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
schedule that has been approved at the
 
06:33:11.510 --> 06:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
national level
 
06:33:13.750 --> 06:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
through the acip and the american
 
06:33:15.910 --> 06:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
academy of pediatrics
 
06:33:17.830 --> 06:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
i say this because it's again an
 
06:33:20.548 --> 06:33:20.558 align:start position:0%
innovative program that many states have
 
06:33:22.788 --> 06:33:22.798 align:start position:0%
replicated and it's a cost-saving
 
06:33:25.030 --> 06:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
measure as well too
 
06:33:27.030 --> 06:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
as you know this is not about cova this
 
06:33:29.590 --> 06:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
is really about our childhood
 
06:33:32.230 --> 06:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
vaccination program and weakening that
 
06:33:34.868 --> 06:33:34.878 align:start position:0%
program by adding a vaccination adding a
 
06:33:37.990 --> 06:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
philosophical vaccination um not only
 
06:33:39.750 --> 06:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
would there be
 
06:33:42.628 --> 06:33:42.638 align:start position:0%
cost there's a huge cost savings when we
 
06:33:45.430 --> 06:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
talk about vaccinations um and i have
 
06:33:47.430 --> 06:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
some information in my testimony about
 
06:33:50.070 --> 06:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
how much money you save uh with every
 
06:33:52.948 --> 06:33:52.958 align:start position:0%
round of childhood vaccines
 
06:33:55.510 --> 06:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
again we have very high rates of
 
06:33:58.468 --> 06:33:58.478 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates in the state um a very
 
06:34:00.948 --> 06:34:00.958 align:start position:0%
low exemption rate at this point but the
 
06:34:03.670 --> 06:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
fear is once you add an easy opt out
 
06:34:05.270 --> 06:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
that we've talked about
 
06:34:07.110 --> 06:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
it will impact
 
06:34:09.590 --> 06:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
the greater number of folks who sent
 
06:34:12.788 --> 06:34:12.798 align:start position:0%
their kids to school unvaccinated
 
06:34:14.230 --> 06:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
public health achievements such as
 
06:34:16.230 --> 06:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
vaccines are often a victim of their own
 
06:34:18.150 --> 06:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
success because
 
06:34:20.390 --> 06:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
vaccines many of us have never seen
 
06:34:22.468 --> 06:34:22.478 align:start position:0%
polio tetanus all the diseases you've
 
06:34:22.478 --> 06:34:23.670 align:start position:0%
polio tetanus all the diseases you've
heard

06:34:23.670 --> 06:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
heard
 
06:34:25.590 --> 06:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
and it also protects a broader
 
06:34:27.590 --> 06:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
population because they build a
 
06:34:29.750 --> 06:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
protective firewall around us by
 
06:34:32.230 --> 06:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
increasing immunity and protecting those
 
06:34:34.070 --> 06:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
who can't get vaccinated including
 
06:34:36.150 --> 06:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
infants and children and adults with
 
06:34:38.070 --> 06:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
weakened immune system
 
06:34:40.868 --> 06:34:40.878 align:start position:0%
um so i think i sped through it but i am
 
06:34:43.110 --> 06:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
leaving you with my testimony um
 
06:34:46.548 --> 06:34:46.558 align:start position:0%
information about um some outbreaks um
 
06:34:49.910 --> 06:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
that happened after a result of um a
 
06:34:52.070 --> 06:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
widening of the exemptions and since you
 
06:34:54.310 --> 06:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
like maps i'm bringing you the same map
 
06:34:57.510 --> 06:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:59.590 --> 06:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you so much you're always welcome
 
06:34:59.600 --> 06:35:01.510 align:start position:0%
thank you so much you're always welcome

06:35:01.510 --> 06:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:35:03.110 --> 06:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
while these are going around the chair
 
06:35:06.230 --> 06:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
calls dr claire o'grady from barnstead
 
06:35:07.990 --> 06:35:08.000 align:start position:0%

house bill 1035.
um

06:35:27.510 --> 06:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:29.270 --> 06:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
as many people have already pointed out
 
06:35:31.750 --> 06:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
since the mid-1800s the u.s school
 
06:35:34.468 --> 06:35:34.478 align:start position:0%
system has done quite a bit to improve
 
06:35:36.390 --> 06:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
american children's health including
 
06:35:39.030 --> 06:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
introducing physical education classes
 
06:35:41.190 --> 06:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
reviewing fire safety but also being a
 
06:35:41.200 --> 06:35:41.990 align:start position:0%
reviewing fire safety but also being a
place

06:35:41.990 --> 06:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
place
 
06:35:44.390 --> 06:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
where vaccination mandates occurred
 
06:35:45.990 --> 06:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
first with our neighbor in the south
 
06:35:46.000 --> 06:35:47.590 align:start position:0%
first with our neighbor in the south
massachusetts

06:35:47.590 --> 06:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
06:35:49.350 --> 06:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
um we've learned a lot from these school
 
06:35:51.270 --> 06:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
vaccination mandates and the subsequent
 
06:35:53.110 --> 06:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
supreme court cases revolving around
 
06:35:54.788 --> 06:35:54.798 align:start position:0%
them including jacobson versus
 
06:35:57.510 --> 06:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and zucked versus king
 
06:35:59.670 --> 06:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
in both of these cases where individuals
 
06:36:01.670 --> 06:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
challenge the vaccination mandates due
 
06:36:03.750 --> 06:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
to perceived oppression
 
06:36:05.590 --> 06:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
against their personal liberties it was
 
06:36:07.750 --> 06:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
deemed that quote every well-ordered
 
06:36:09.430 --> 06:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
society charged with the duty of
 
06:36:11.430 --> 06:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
conserving the safety of its members
 
06:36:13.430 --> 06:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
must understand that an individual's
 
06:36:15.510 --> 06:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
liberty does not outweigh the protection
 
06:36:17.910 --> 06:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
of public health and safety in the face
 
06:36:20.390 --> 06:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
of great danger such as a pandemic or a
 
06:36:21.910 --> 06:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
deadly illness
 
06:36:24.070 --> 06:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately in both cases the court held
 
06:36:26.070 --> 06:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
that mandatory vaccinations are neither
 
06:36:28.310 --> 06:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
arbitrary nor oppressive so long as they
 
06:36:30.310 --> 06:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
meet several conditions
 
06:36:31.750 --> 06:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
there are three of them
 
06:36:33.350 --> 06:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
one that there's a grave threat to the
 
06:36:35.510 --> 06:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
public without vaccination two that
 
06:36:38.310 --> 06:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
vaccines mandated are safe and effective
 
06:36:40.548 --> 06:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
and three that mandatory vaccination has
 
06:36:43.030 --> 06:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
superior cost-benefit profile
 
06:36:45.270 --> 06:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
in the written testimony that i'll give
 
06:36:47.910 --> 06:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
to you guys i'll outline on how our
 
06:36:52.070 --> 06:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
current vaccines meet all three criteria
 
06:36:53.910 --> 06:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
our school vaccine mandates do meet
 
06:36:55.670 --> 06:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
these three conditions our current
 
06:36:57.750 --> 06:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
school vaccinations are not oppressive
 
06:37:00.150 --> 06:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
nor are they unconstitutional what would
 
06:37:02.468 --> 06:37:02.478 align:start position:0%
be oppressive and unconstitutional is
 
06:37:04.390 --> 06:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
allowing conscientious objection
 
06:37:06.948 --> 06:37:06.958 align:start position:0%
exemptions or personal opinions
 
06:37:09.110 --> 06:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
to trump the safety of our children
 
06:37:11.030 --> 06:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
school of action and school vaccination
 
06:37:12.868 --> 06:37:12.878 align:start position:0%
mandates are largely associated with
 
06:37:14.868 --> 06:37:14.878 align:start position:0%
increased vaccine coverage by
 
06:37:16.788 --> 06:37:16.798 align:start position:0%
introducing this alternative exemption
 
06:37:18.548 --> 06:37:18.558 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is permitting a decrease
 
06:37:20.628 --> 06:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
in the rate of vaccine coverage a
 
06:37:22.788 --> 06:37:22.798 align:start position:0%
fracture in our herd community and an
 
06:37:25.030 --> 06:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
increased risk for infections and death
 
06:37:26.948 --> 06:37:26.958 align:start position:0%
i ask that you guys oppose house bill
 
06:37:29.350 --> 06:37:29.360 align:start position:0%

mother
 
06:38:35.910 --> 06:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
from all these perspectives i strongly
 
06:38:37.110 --> 06:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
encourage you
 
06:38:40.628 --> 06:38:40.638 align:start position:0%
to vote no on house bill 1035
 
06:38:42.310 --> 06:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:38:43.670 --> 06:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
passing this bill
 
06:38:46.548 --> 06:38:46.558 align:start position:0%
would be reckless and really
 
06:38:48.788 --> 06:38:48.798 align:start position:0%
shows disregard for history
 
06:38:50.708 --> 06:38:50.718 align:start position:0%
and science as many of the previous
 
06:38:52.948 --> 06:38:52.958 align:start position:0%
speakers have mentioned
 
06:38:55.430 --> 06:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
this bill would bring our public schools
 
06:38:56.548 --> 06:38:56.558 align:start position:0%
back to
 
06:38:56.558 --> 06:38:57.590 align:start position:0%
back to
the

06:38:57.590 --> 06:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:39:00.628 --> 06:39:00.638 align:start position:0%
state of decades even centuries ago when
 
06:39:02.628 --> 06:39:02.638 align:start position:0%
these vaccine preventable illnesses ran
 
06:39:02.638 --> 06:39:05.830 align:start position:0%
these vaccine preventable illnesses ran
rampant

06:39:05.830 --> 06:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:05.840 --> 06:39:07.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:39:07.270 --> 06:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:10.390 --> 06:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
i will um
 
06:39:12.708 --> 06:39:12.718 align:start position:0%
try to speed through and i'm echoing
 
06:39:13.990 --> 06:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
some of the points that others have had
 
06:39:16.390 --> 06:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
but part of the problem here is that
 
06:39:17.910 --> 06:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
these vaccines are so effective that
 
06:39:19.590 --> 06:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
many of us have never seen these
 
06:39:21.750 --> 06:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
diseases you know i think polio is such
 
06:39:23.830 --> 06:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
a good example i can't imagine being a
 
06:39:25.910 --> 06:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
parent in the 1940s and worrying about
 
06:39:27.670 --> 06:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
my child waking up
 
06:39:27.680 --> 06:39:28.868 align:start position:0%
my child waking up
paralyzed

06:39:28.868 --> 06:39:28.878 align:start position:0%
paralyzed
 
06:39:30.708 --> 06:39:30.718 align:start position:0%
and and so when the polio vaccine was
 
06:39:33.670 --> 06:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
introduced in the 1950s that was very
 
06:39:35.590 --> 06:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
well accepted and adopted parents were
 
06:39:37.830 --> 06:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
so grateful because they saw that threat
 
06:39:40.390 --> 06:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
every day we don't you know i've never
 
06:39:41.750 --> 06:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
seen a child with measles and i'm a
 
06:39:46.230 --> 06:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
pediatrician um but
 
06:39:49.350 --> 06:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
i think you know it's important to
 
06:39:51.270 --> 06:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
believe the scientific and historical
 
06:39:53.910 --> 06:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
accounts of these diseases just as i
 
06:39:55.190 --> 06:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
have never been to mount everest than
 
06:39:57.350 --> 06:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
believe scientific accounts of
 
06:40:00.070 --> 06:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
the climate there
 
06:40:01.350 --> 06:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
06:40:03.030 --> 06:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
symptoms of these illnesses all gloss
 
06:40:05.350 --> 06:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
over because i think they have been you
 
06:40:07.030 --> 06:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
know it's been hammered home that these
 
06:40:09.270 --> 06:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
illnesses are deadly and that the risks
 
06:40:11.350 --> 06:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
of these illnesses are much greater than
 
06:40:16.070 --> 06:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:17.030 --> 06:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's been
 
06:40:20.150 --> 06:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
so i will just end by saying
 
06:40:20.160 --> 06:40:21.510 align:start position:0%
so i will just end by saying
children

06:40:21.510 --> 06:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:40:23.590 --> 06:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
sending parents have the right to choose
 
06:40:25.270 --> 06:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
not to vaccinate their children that is
 
06:40:27.270 --> 06:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
their right if they choose to take those
 
06:40:29.510 --> 06:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
risks absolutely they are welcome to do
 
06:40:30.788 --> 06:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
that i will recommend that they
 
06:40:32.628 --> 06:40:32.638 align:start position:0%
vaccinate their children but they have
 
06:40:34.548 --> 06:40:34.558 align:start position:0%
that right they do not have the right to
 
06:40:36.948 --> 06:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
then send their children to school with
 
06:40:39.270 --> 06:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
other children who may have leukemia and
 
06:40:41.430 --> 06:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
be unable to be vaccinated
 
06:40:43.430 --> 06:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
putting all those children and teachers
 
06:40:45.270 --> 06:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
at risk is
 
06:40:48.548 --> 06:40:48.558 align:start position:0%
in my opinion more of a rights violation
 
06:40:50.390 --> 06:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
i strongly urge you to
 
06:40:52.548 --> 06:40:52.558 align:start position:0%
oppose house bill 1035 thank you thank
 
06:40:56.150 --> 06:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
you doctor the chair calls gary
 
06:41:02.548 --> 06:41:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:05.110 --> 06:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
is that dr gary york thank you yes i
 
06:41:07.030 --> 06:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
thought so yes you didn't you left it
 
06:41:09.350 --> 06:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
off i'm not a pediatrician well neither
 
06:41:14.310 --> 06:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:17.750 --> 06:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
i must admit i'm not a little confused
 
06:41:19.990 --> 06:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
with all the legislation that's going
 
06:41:20.000 --> 06:41:21.030 align:start position:0%
with all the legislation that's going
around

06:41:21.030 --> 06:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
around
 
06:41:24.628 --> 06:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
i looked at this bill and
 
06:41:26.468 --> 06:41:26.478 align:start position:0%
if i'll it follow on the heels of the
 
06:41:29.590 --> 06:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
bill that we heard presented recently
 
06:41:33.670 --> 06:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
and it it left me uh at sea to be honest
 
06:41:33.680 --> 06:41:35.590 align:start position:0%
and it it left me uh at sea to be honest
because

06:41:35.590 --> 06:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:41:37.750 --> 06:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
the previous bill
 
06:41:37.760 --> 06:41:39.190 align:start position:0%
the previous bill
was

06:41:39.190 --> 06:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:41:41.990 --> 06:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
put forth to require
 
06:41:42.000 --> 06:41:43.350 align:start position:0%
put forth to require
a

06:41:43.350 --> 06:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:41:48.070 --> 06:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
copy 19 vaccine in the school system
 
06:41:49.990 --> 06:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
so in the main i don't have any issues
 
06:41:52.708 --> 06:41:52.718 align:start position:0%
with the currently required
 
06:41:54.948 --> 06:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
vaccines for attendance
 
06:41:57.350 --> 06:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
i have deep concerns about the schedule
 
06:42:00.628 --> 06:42:00.638 align:start position:0%
of those vaccines but nonetheless
 
06:42:03.430 --> 06:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
i looked at this bill and
 
06:42:05.510 --> 06:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking if the previous bill is
 
06:42:05.520 --> 06:42:06.628 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking if the previous bill is
passed

06:42:06.628 --> 06:42:06.638 align:start position:0%
passed
 
06:42:09.910 --> 06:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
that we heard about copen 19
 
06:42:12.390 --> 06:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
and i think you all know the passion i
 
06:42:16.548 --> 06:42:16.558 align:start position:0%
have about testifying for
 
06:42:16.558 --> 06:42:17.350 align:start position:0%
have about testifying for
the

06:42:17.350 --> 06:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:42:19.830 --> 06:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
mandates and vaccines
 
06:42:22.150 --> 06:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
how would that even uh
 
06:42:23.990 --> 06:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
come into play here it would seem that
 
06:42:26.150 --> 06:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
then um
 
06:42:29.430 --> 06:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
suppose that the 19 vaccine is rushed
 
06:42:31.670 --> 06:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
through like so much of
 
06:42:35.510 --> 06:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
the cobin 19 stuff and it became
 
06:42:38.310 --> 06:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
available fda approved
 
06:42:41.510 --> 06:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
i don't feel there's been a lot of
 
06:42:44.310 --> 06:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
safety data on that vaccine
 
06:42:47.190 --> 06:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
so i guess um as i say i'm not against
 
06:42:50.070 --> 06:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
the historic uh required vaccines but
 
06:42:51.670 --> 06:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to cover the bases
 
06:42:54.230 --> 06:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
because as a citizen i'm confused by all
 
06:42:57.830 --> 06:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
the overlap of some of these bills and i
 
06:43:02.548 --> 06:43:02.558 align:start position:0%
uh i just i'm i like the part that says
 
06:43:04.788 --> 06:43:04.798 align:start position:0%
let's just say that
 
06:43:07.110 --> 06:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
a vaccine for covet is required say
 
06:43:08.948 --> 06:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
within six months
 
06:43:12.070 --> 06:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh i don't think any of my
 
06:43:12.080 --> 06:43:13.590 align:start position:0%
uh i don't think any of my
children

06:43:13.590 --> 06:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:43:15.670 --> 06:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
if they were of school age would have
 
06:43:18.150 --> 06:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
the religious exemption or the medic
 
06:43:19.750 --> 06:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
medical exemption
 
06:43:19.760 --> 06:43:20.628 align:start position:0%
medical exemption
but

06:43:20.628 --> 06:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:43:23.830 --> 06:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
having a conscientious objection
 
06:43:26.628 --> 06:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
allows for someone to
 
06:43:29.350 --> 06:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
declare a long-held
 
06:43:33.430 --> 06:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
personal belief that is sincere
 
06:43:36.310 --> 06:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
and i think you have to honor that
 
06:43:38.150 --> 06:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:43:40.708 --> 06:43:40.718 align:start position:0%
i'm up here kind of befuddled and
 
06:43:42.868 --> 06:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
i'm just showing you
 
06:43:45.750 --> 06:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
my crazy mind spinning around
 
06:43:47.510 --> 06:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
06:43:49.350 --> 06:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
that's quite all right the only
 
06:43:51.510 --> 06:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
difference is we have the same but we
 
06:43:56.390 --> 06:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:58.548 --> 06:43:58.558 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes paula mckinnon comes
 
06:44:01.190 --> 06:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
back to us new hampshire school nurse
 
06:44:01.200 --> 06:44:02.788 align:start position:0%
back to us new hampshire school nurse
association

06:44:02.788 --> 06:44:02.798 align:start position:0%
association
 
06:44:10.708 --> 06:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:12.230 --> 06:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
06:44:14.708 --> 06:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
uh i am paula mckinnon i have been a
 
06:44:17.030 --> 06:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
school nurse for 27 years and a nurse
 
06:44:18.468 --> 06:44:18.478 align:start position:0%
for 30 years
 
06:44:20.868 --> 06:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
and school nurses are the
 
06:44:23.270 --> 06:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
entity that actually
 
06:44:25.350 --> 06:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
implements the law when it comes to
 
06:44:28.390 --> 06:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates the legislature has
 
06:44:30.788 --> 06:44:30.798 align:start position:0%
already said that the schools have the
 
06:44:33.830 --> 06:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
power to exclude children from school
 
06:44:36.548 --> 06:44:36.558 align:start position:0%
if they don't have the required vaccines
 
06:44:39.350 --> 06:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
and that is the way if you choose to use
 
06:44:42.628 --> 06:44:42.638 align:start position:0%
the word coerce that is the way we get
 
06:44:45.030 --> 06:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
people to comply with the law
 
06:44:47.110 --> 06:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
now i do have written testimony i'm
 
06:44:50.070 --> 06:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
going to skip over most of it and get to
 
06:44:53.190 --> 06:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
some points that i'd like to make
 
06:44:54.628 --> 06:44:54.638 align:start position:0%
there has been
 
06:44:57.990 --> 06:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
testimony or comments made
 
06:45:00.310 --> 06:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
that the information that's given to the
 
06:45:03.110 --> 06:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
school as to your
 
06:45:04.830 --> 06:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
reason for a medical
 
06:45:07.190 --> 06:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
exemption then gets passed on to
 
06:45:10.070 --> 06:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
government agencies and i can say with
 
06:45:12.150 --> 06:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
100 percent certainty that that is not
 
06:45:13.350 --> 06:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
the case
 
06:45:17.430 --> 06:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh the school law ferpa which is the
 
06:45:19.910 --> 06:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
release of information from schools
 
06:45:19.920 --> 06:45:20.788 align:start position:0%
release of information from schools
would

06:45:20.788 --> 06:45:20.798 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:45:22.788 --> 06:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
strictly prohibit that
 
06:45:25.350 --> 06:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
and while the school nurse has knowledge
 
06:45:26.628 --> 06:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
of these
 
06:45:28.548 --> 06:45:28.558 align:start position:0%
people and their
 
06:45:31.510 --> 06:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
medical exemptions it stops there it's
 
06:45:33.270 --> 06:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
not reported to teachers it's not
 
06:45:35.510 --> 06:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
reported to the state it is recorded
 
06:45:38.070 --> 06:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
nowhere except in the child's own health
 
06:45:40.070 --> 06:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
record as i'm sure it also is at the
 
06:45:42.628 --> 06:45:42.638 align:start position:0%
doctor's office
 
06:45:44.868 --> 06:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
if i could speak for a moment
 
06:45:46.788 --> 06:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
about you've got about half a minute to
 
06:45:49.030 --> 06:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
go oh great okay
 
06:45:51.430 --> 06:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
i'm going to give you in my testimony uh
 
06:45:53.030 --> 06:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
there are ten different medical
 
06:45:56.868 --> 06:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
organizations that in 2019
 
06:45:59.990 --> 06:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
did studies on the
 
06:46:04.310 --> 06:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:06.310 --> 06:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
i'll give you that for your reading
 
06:46:08.948 --> 06:46:08.958 align:start position:0%
pleasure later on today
 
06:46:11.030 --> 06:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
i would also like to state that
 
06:46:12.708 --> 06:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's unintended
 
06:46:14.948 --> 06:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
consequences from from laws that are
 
06:46:16.788 --> 06:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
passed and
 
06:46:16.798 --> 06:46:17.670 align:start position:0%
passed and
if

06:46:17.670 --> 06:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:46:19.750 --> 06:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
we want our children to be back full
 
06:46:21.510 --> 06:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
time and in person
 
06:46:24.310 --> 06:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
for all of the vaccine-mandated diseases
 
06:46:28.548 --> 06:46:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:30.868 --> 06:46:30.878 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and let's just throw it out
 
06:46:32.628 --> 06:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
there what if measles came into new
 
06:46:36.230 --> 06:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire and in my school i've got 10
 
06:46:38.788 --> 06:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
children that are not vaccinated against
 
06:46:41.190 --> 06:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
measles wrap it up 15 seconds one of
 
06:46:43.030 --> 06:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
them brought measles into the school
 
06:46:45.270 --> 06:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
community unintended consequences of
 
06:46:47.670 --> 06:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
those 10 that are unvaccinated are
 
06:46:50.628 --> 06:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
required by law to stay home so that we
 
06:46:50.638 --> 06:46:52.150 align:start position:0%
required by law to stay home so that we
can

06:46:52.150 --> 06:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
can
 
06:46:54.390 --> 06:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
not proliferate the
 
06:46:54.400 --> 06:46:55.270 align:start position:0%
not proliferate the
the

06:46:55.270 --> 06:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:46:57.030 --> 06:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
disease being spread further thank you
 
06:46:59.350 --> 06:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
so much for your testimony we appreciate
 
06:47:01.590 --> 06:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
it we wish we had a lot longer but we
 
06:47:01.600 --> 06:47:02.548 align:start position:0%
it we wish we had a lot longer but we
don't

06:47:02.548 --> 06:47:02.558 align:start position:0%
don't
 
06:47:05.030 --> 06:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
the chair next recognizes dr jennifer
 
06:47:07.270 --> 06:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
jones who's going to tell us
 
06:47:09.270 --> 06:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
where she's from
 
06:47:09.280 --> 06:47:10.468 align:start position:0%
where she's from
uh

06:47:10.468 --> 06:47:10.478 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:47:12.708 --> 06:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
what her specialty is
 
06:47:14.868 --> 06:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
in medicine thank you mr chairman my
 
06:47:16.150 --> 06:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
name is dr jennifer jones i'm a
 
06:47:18.788 --> 06:47:18.798 align:start position:0%
pediatrician i work for core pediatric
 
06:47:20.230 --> 06:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
and adolescent medicine where i serve as
 
06:47:22.150 --> 06:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
the medical director it's the large
 
06:47:23.830 --> 06:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
pediatric group that is associated with
 
06:47:26.070 --> 06:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
exeter hospital
 
06:47:27.910 --> 06:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
i had some prepared testimony but given
 
06:47:29.510 --> 06:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
that there's two minutes and we've had a
 
06:47:32.230 --> 06:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
lot of good testimony already um i think
 
06:47:34.230 --> 06:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
instead what i'd like to do is respond
 
06:47:36.390 --> 06:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
to some um concepts that have been
 
06:47:37.750 --> 06:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
brought forward
 
06:47:39.270 --> 06:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
specifically i'd like to talk about a
 
06:47:40.788 --> 06:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
medical exemption
 
06:47:43.670 --> 06:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
i grant medical exemptions for vaccines
 
06:47:46.230 --> 06:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
not only do i grant them i suggest them
 
06:47:47.990 --> 06:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
because medically it is the right thing
 
06:47:49.350 --> 06:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
to do
 
06:47:52.390 --> 06:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
some children meet medical criteria that
 
06:47:53.910 --> 06:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
they should not be vaccinated for
 
06:47:55.430 --> 06:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
certain vaccines
 
06:47:57.990 --> 06:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
and it is not controversial it is not
 
06:48:00.628 --> 06:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
based on my personal feelings it's based
 
06:48:03.190 --> 06:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
on scientific uh guidelines for which
 
06:48:04.468 --> 06:48:04.478 align:start position:0%
types of children should avoid
 
06:48:04.478 --> 06:48:06.070 align:start position:0%
types of children should avoid
vaccination

06:48:06.070 --> 06:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
06:48:07.990 --> 06:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh i don't worry about being
 
06:48:09.910 --> 06:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
investigated or
 
06:48:12.070 --> 06:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
getting in trouble for giving vaccine
 
06:48:13.910 --> 06:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
mandates because medically i'm providing
 
06:48:16.628 --> 06:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
appropriate evidence-based care
 
06:48:18.070 --> 06:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
the time i might be worried about being
 
06:48:20.548 --> 06:48:20.558 align:start position:0%
investigated is if i provided a false
 
06:48:24.230 --> 06:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
medical exemption which i would not do
 
06:48:27.190 --> 06:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
i also would like to comment on the idea
 
06:48:29.030 --> 06:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
of people who choose alternative healthy
 
06:48:31.990 --> 06:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
lifestyles i think that's wonderful
 
06:48:32.000 --> 06:48:32.868 align:start position:0%
lifestyles i think that's wonderful
and

06:48:32.868 --> 06:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:48:35.990 --> 06:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
certainly promotes general health
 
06:48:38.230 --> 06:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
does not however provide antibodies in
 
06:48:40.628 --> 06:48:40.638 align:start position:0%
your body against infectious diseases
 
06:48:43.350 --> 06:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
there really are no alternatives to
 
06:48:45.510 --> 06:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
vaccinations to protect you against
 
06:48:48.390 --> 06:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
particular diseases
 
06:48:50.468 --> 06:48:50.478 align:start position:0%
in terms of the idea of inalienable
 
06:48:51.670 --> 06:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
rights i've been thinking about that
 
06:48:54.788 --> 06:48:54.798 align:start position:0%
while sitting in this room and um
 
06:48:57.190 --> 06:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's very clear that all parents
 
06:48:59.510 --> 06:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
have the right as dr arsenal mentioned
 
06:49:01.190 --> 06:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
to decline vaccines
 
06:49:03.350 --> 06:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
parents decline vaccines in my office
 
06:49:04.708 --> 06:49:04.718 align:start position:0%
all the time
 
06:49:06.390 --> 06:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
and we talk about it we talk about the
 
06:49:08.708 --> 06:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
risks and benefits we talk about their
 
06:49:11.030 --> 06:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
concerns their fears their worries
 
06:49:12.948 --> 06:49:12.958 align:start position:0%
and um of course they have that
 
06:49:14.708 --> 06:49:14.718 align:start position:0%
inalienable right i cannot hold their
 
06:49:16.150 --> 06:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
child down and give them a vaccine
 
06:49:18.150 --> 06:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
against their consent
 
06:49:19.990 --> 06:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
i think that is separate from the idea
 
06:49:21.350 --> 06:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
of whether they can participate in
 
06:49:24.150 --> 06:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
school as part of society and so those
 
06:49:25.990 --> 06:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
are just some of my thoughts on the idea
 
06:49:29.190 --> 06:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
of inalienable rights
 
06:49:30.628 --> 06:49:30.638 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
06:49:33.430 --> 06:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
the covid vaccine that's not what this
 
06:49:35.190 --> 06:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
bill is about this bill has nothing to
 
06:49:36.948 --> 06:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
do with the coveted vaccine
 
06:49:38.708 --> 06:49:38.718 align:start position:0%
this bill is about
 
06:49:41.190 --> 06:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
established science on vaccines that
 
06:49:43.030 --> 06:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
have been part of routine pediatric care
 
06:49:44.628 --> 06:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
for decades
 
06:49:46.310 --> 06:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
and i think some of the discussion about
 
06:49:49.430 --> 06:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
kovid is a distraction from this bill i
 
06:49:51.590 --> 06:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
urge this committee to vote against this
 
06:49:54.230 --> 06:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
bill thank you i want to question if um
 
06:49:57.190 --> 06:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
i'll try to word it more graciously
 
06:49:59.030 --> 06:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
i think i have a different understanding
 
06:50:01.670 --> 06:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
06:50:05.150 --> 06:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
then it's not about cobit if it is about
 
06:50:08.548 --> 06:50:08.558 align:start position:0%
vaccinations doesn't it include covid
 
06:50:10.948 --> 06:50:10.958 align:start position:0%
with the others it's not solely about
 
06:50:13.270 --> 06:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
covert but it includes it does it not mr
 
06:50:14.788 --> 06:50:14.798 align:start position:0%
chairman i don't believe that it
 
06:50:16.868 --> 06:50:16.878 align:start position:0%
pertains to covet as coveted vaccine is
 
06:50:18.230 --> 06:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
not currently mandated in the state of
 
06:50:20.548 --> 06:50:20.558 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and this bill my
 
06:50:22.708 --> 06:50:22.718 align:start position:0%
understanding is refers to the current
 
06:50:22.718 --> 06:50:23.510 align:start position:0%
understanding is refers to the current
law

06:50:23.510 --> 06:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
law
 
06:50:25.430 --> 06:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
and the nine vaccinations that are
 
06:50:27.030 --> 06:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
required for children plus one
 
06:50:28.868 --> 06:50:28.878 align:start position:0%
additional for preschool children covet
 
06:50:30.868 --> 06:50:30.878 align:start position:0%
is not included on that list i thank you
 
06:50:32.468 --> 06:50:32.478 align:start position:0%
for your clarification i think you're
 
06:50:33.990 --> 06:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
06:50:36.548 --> 06:50:36.558 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony

06:50:47.190 --> 06:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is laura condon
 
06:50:48.708 --> 06:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
i'm from bedford i'm the new hampshire
 
06:50:50.390 --> 06:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
director of advocacy with the national
 
06:50:52.788 --> 06:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
vaccine information center
 
06:50:54.310 --> 06:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
06:50:54.320 --> 06:50:55.590 align:start position:0%
would you believe
that

06:50:55.590 --> 06:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:50:58.230 --> 06:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
that i served for five years as public
 
06:51:00.150 --> 06:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
member on the new hampshire vaccine
 
06:51:03.350 --> 06:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
association board um so i know it pretty
 
06:51:05.110 --> 06:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
well would you believe that the
 
06:51:06.788 --> 06:51:06.798 align:start position:0%
department spends about 30 million
 
06:51:09.590 --> 06:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
dollars every year on child vaccines
 
06:51:13.110 --> 06:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
would you believe that 40 74
 
06:51:15.990 --> 06:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
of those 30 million vaccine purchases
 
06:51:18.468 --> 06:51:18.478 align:start position:0%
are received by parents on a voluntary
 
06:51:18.478 --> 06:51:19.830 align:start position:0%
are received by parents on a voluntary
basis

06:51:19.830 --> 06:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
basis
 
06:51:22.948 --> 06:51:22.958 align:start position:0%
74 percent of vaccines in new hampshire
 
06:51:25.030 --> 06:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
received in a voluntary basis no
 
06:51:27.750 --> 06:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
mandates no exemptions required parents
 
06:51:30.390 --> 06:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
are willingly getting 47 percent of the
 
06:51:34.070 --> 06:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines that the state purchases
 
06:51:37.270 --> 06:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
and um although the the state did
 
06:51:40.390 --> 06:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
report that during the pandemic vaccine
 
06:51:43.750 --> 06:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
use is down about 60 percent based on
 
06:51:45.350 --> 06:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine ordering and we've seen
 
06:51:48.230 --> 06:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely zero outbreaks of any
 
06:51:50.788 --> 06:51:50.798 align:start position:0%
childhood diseases
 
06:51:53.670 --> 06:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
parents know their children's best um
 
06:51:55.190 --> 06:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
they love their children more than
 
06:51:57.750 --> 06:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else it really should be a
 
06:52:00.468 --> 06:52:00.478 align:start position:0%
parent's right to to decide there's been
 
06:52:03.030 --> 06:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
talk here about nine or ten vaccines for
 
06:52:05.670 --> 06:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
children let's be clear there are 35
 
06:52:08.070 --> 06:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
doses of vaccines required for children
 
06:52:10.628 --> 06:52:10.638 align:start position:0%
in daycare and schools in new hampshire
 
06:52:12.230 --> 06:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
many of these vaccines for illnesses
 
06:52:14.708 --> 06:52:14.718 align:start position:0%
that are non-communicable in a classroom
 
06:52:16.948 --> 06:52:16.958 align:start position:0%
setting such as hepatitis b many of
 
06:52:18.788 --> 06:52:18.798 align:start position:0%
these vaccines do not prevent illness or
 
06:52:21.510 --> 06:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
spread pertussis vaccine is one example
 
06:52:24.070 --> 06:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
only reducing symptoms to that of a cold
 
06:52:26.150 --> 06:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
resulting in greater spread other
 
06:52:28.628 --> 06:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
vaccines fail to provide immunity mumps
 
06:52:30.548 --> 06:52:30.558 align:start position:0%
for example as thousands of cases of
 
06:52:32.548 --> 06:52:32.558 align:start position:0%
mump occur every year and fully
 
06:52:35.670 --> 06:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
vaccinated college students
 
06:52:37.030 --> 06:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
children do not have a vaccine
 
06:52:39.030 --> 06:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
deficiency that needs to be addressed
 
06:52:40.390 --> 06:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
they have
 
06:52:43.270 --> 06:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
immune systems that work just fine and
 
06:52:45.190 --> 06:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
on our advanced living conditions
 
06:52:47.750 --> 06:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
including indoor plumbing child labor
 
06:52:50.390 --> 06:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
laws have been instituted um we don't
 
06:52:53.110 --> 06:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
spray ddt the paralyzing agent on
 
06:52:56.310 --> 06:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
children anymore good thing um
 
06:52:58.468 --> 06:52:58.478 align:start position:0%
that um there's been much that have been
 
06:52:59.830 --> 06:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
changed when you look at the history
 
06:53:01.830 --> 06:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
there there's a lot to be changed
 
06:53:03.910 --> 06:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
parents are increasingly bullied at
 
06:53:06.310 --> 06:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
doctor's office to submit a vaccination
 
06:53:09.190 --> 06:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
those parents come to me 15 seconds i
 
06:53:10.948 --> 06:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
had one such parent that we actually had
 
06:53:12.788 --> 06:53:12.798 align:start position:0%
to file a police report she was so
 
06:53:15.190 --> 06:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
bullied by her national pediatrician
 
06:53:17.430 --> 06:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
i i urge you to
 
06:53:20.868 --> 06:53:20.878 align:start position:0%
no joke um i urge you that here we are
 
06:53:22.548 --> 06:53:22.558 align:start position:0%
in a free state and a free nation we
 
06:53:24.468 --> 06:53:24.478 align:start position:0%
respect the rights and responsibility of
 
06:53:26.548 --> 06:53:26.558 align:start position:0%
parents to make medical decisions in the
 
06:53:28.468 --> 06:53:28.478 align:start position:0%
best interest of their own children i
 
06:53:30.150 --> 06:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote this bill is ought to
 
06:53:32.310 --> 06:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
pass thank you and the chair now calls
 
06:53:34.708 --> 06:53:34.718 align:start position:0%
on um
 
06:53:36.868 --> 06:53:36.878 align:start position:0%
russon chester
 
06:53:40.948 --> 06:53:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:40.958 --> 06:53:41.910 align:start position:0%
 
right

06:53:41.910 --> 06:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:53:45.030 --> 06:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
last name kind of messes everyone up
 
06:53:46.310 --> 06:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chair thank you
 
06:53:48.708 --> 06:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
committee members i'm going to be brief
 
06:53:50.948 --> 06:53:50.958 align:start position:0%
um yay
 
06:53:52.868 --> 06:53:52.878 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is is that i listened to
 
06:53:54.468 --> 06:53:54.478 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks today
 
06:53:57.510 --> 06:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
and they talked about the importance of
 
06:53:59.750 --> 06:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
school systems done a lot of good first
 
06:54:01.270 --> 06:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
with neighbor
 
06:54:04.390 --> 06:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
in the south massachusetts what makes uh
 
06:54:07.830 --> 06:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
what makes the it good is if
 
06:54:10.868 --> 06:54:10.878 align:start position:0%
if a vaccine if a vaccine can help
 
06:54:13.110 --> 06:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
prevent great threat
 
06:54:15.750 --> 06:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
safe if it's safe and effective
 
06:54:19.430 --> 06:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
and it's cost benefit profile
 
06:54:19.440 --> 06:54:20.150 align:start position:0%
and it's cost benefit profile
so

06:54:20.150 --> 06:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:54:23.270 --> 06:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
when a parent's child
 
06:54:24.948 --> 06:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
is damaged
 
06:54:27.830 --> 06:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
from a vaccine injury
 
06:54:29.430 --> 06:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
can we use that
 
06:54:32.070 --> 06:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
is that okay is it okay to say yes but
 
06:54:34.230 --> 06:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
cost benefit says it was worth it to
 
06:54:36.070 --> 06:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
have your child hurt
 
06:54:39.270 --> 06:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
that's not okay one child we see it on
 
06:54:42.628 --> 06:54:42.638 align:start position:0%
our highways one death is too many
 
06:54:45.910 --> 06:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
why isn't one vaccine injury too many
 
06:54:48.468 --> 06:54:48.478 align:start position:0%
our children have been dying for years
 
06:54:50.628 --> 06:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
from vaccine injuries or have been
 
06:54:50.638 --> 06:54:52.070 align:start position:0%
from vaccine injuries or have been
deliberately

06:54:52.070 --> 06:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
deliberately
 
06:54:54.548 --> 06:54:54.558 align:start position:0%
injured well not deliberately less
 
06:54:56.868 --> 06:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
necessarily but they've been but i was
 
06:54:59.190 --> 06:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
talking to laura condon and
 
06:55:00.868 --> 06:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
she shocked me with some of the
 
06:55:02.708 --> 06:55:02.718 align:start position:0%
statistics that's been going on with our
 
06:55:04.788 --> 06:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
children the only reason why it's a big
 
06:55:07.750 --> 06:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
deal now which i'm ashamed of is because
 
06:55:10.628 --> 06:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
it's affected the adults and that's
 
06:55:12.548 --> 06:55:12.558 align:start position:0%
that's terrible
 
06:55:13.990 --> 06:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
the other reason why it's become
 
06:55:14.000 --> 06:55:15.190 align:start position:0%
the other reason why it's become
[Music]

06:55:15.190 --> 06:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:55:18.150 --> 06:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
common knowledge is because this whole

it's opened a lot of eyes and a lot of
 
06:55:27.910 --> 06:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
hearts and i thank the lord for that but
 
06:55:29.430 --> 06:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
06:55:29.440 --> 06:55:30.868 align:start position:0%
at the same time
with

06:55:30.868 --> 06:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:55:33.830 --> 06:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
because it we're responsible
 
06:55:37.030 --> 06:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
bottom line is we are responsible for
 
06:55:39.430 --> 06:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
the wealth health and well-being of our
 
06:55:42.390 --> 06:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
children did you know that the amish
 
06:55:46.468 --> 06:55:46.478 align:start position:0%
population has the lowest coven 19
 
06:55:46.478 --> 06:55:47.910 align:start position:0%
population has the lowest coven 19
um

06:55:47.910 --> 06:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:55:51.030 --> 06:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
any kind of cova they must all be
 
06:55:52.868 --> 06:55:52.878 align:start position:0%
well they're not vaccinated so they must
 
06:55:56.948 --> 06:55:56.958 align:start position:0%
all be non whatever um
 
06:56:00.150 --> 06:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
with regards to mean second okay
 
06:56:02.628 --> 06:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
with regards to polio would you believe
 
06:56:04.070 --> 06:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
that i was approached by a
 
06:56:06.948 --> 06:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
representative in this room that says i
 
06:56:10.548 --> 06:56:10.558 align:start position:0%
have polio careful no no no that i i was
 
06:56:14.150 --> 06:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
i was inflicted with polio however i
 
06:56:16.788 --> 06:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
truly believe that the problem was is
 
06:56:18.868 --> 06:56:18.878 align:start position:0%
that i we used to go through the most
 
06:56:18.878 --> 06:56:20.390 align:start position:0%
that i we used to go through the most
mosquito

06:56:20.390 --> 06:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
mosquito
 
06:56:22.070 --> 06:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
um smoke
 
06:56:25.270 --> 06:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm convinced that my polio was
 
06:56:27.110 --> 06:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
caused because i already had natural
 
06:56:29.030 --> 06:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
immunity thank you so much for your
 
06:56:29.040 --> 06:56:30.948 align:start position:0%

06:56:37.750 --> 06:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
um just one final thing the uh prime
 
06:56:37.760 --> 06:56:39.510 align:start position:0%
um just one final thing the uh prime
sponsor

06:56:39.510 --> 06:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
06:56:41.670 --> 06:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
has indicated he's willing to be
 
06:56:44.310 --> 06:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
flexible some of that could go back to
 
06:56:49.590 --> 06:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:52.708 --> 06:56:52.718 align:start position:0%
but he is flexible on the bill and you
 
06:56:55.350 --> 06:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
know we like to get this as many bills

as we can on to consent out of this
 
06:56:59.590 --> 06:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
committee it's not always possible to
 
06:57:02.948 --> 06:57:02.958 align:start position:0%
square the circle but we like to try
 
06:57:05.350 --> 06:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
and i am wondering we don't have to do
 
06:57:07.350 --> 06:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
it but i'd like to give the opportunity
 
06:57:09.750 --> 06:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
as i always do that if there's one or
 
06:57:12.548 --> 06:57:12.558 align:start position:0%
two people who would like to work with
 
06:57:15.910 --> 06:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
the representative the prime sponsor on
 
06:57:18.070 --> 06:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
maybe making the bill
 
06:57:21.510 --> 06:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
acceptable to them without it becoming
 
06:57:23.510 --> 06:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
unacceptable to you
 
06:57:26.070 --> 06:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
