00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
good morning if you could uh join me as
 
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the
 
00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
United States of America and to the
 
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
Republic for which it stands one nation
 
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
under God indivisible with liberty and
 
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
Welcome to our continuing series of
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
hearings on the bill
 
00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 align:start position:0%
reform issue
 
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 align:start position:0%
yesterday we heard a lot of information
 
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to take in that we're
 
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
still going to be processing
 
00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
today we're going to take up a little
 
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
bit less complicated or actually we'll
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
see the issue of paying bail
 
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and making sure that they
 
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
are compensated appropriately for their
 
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.810 align:start position:0%
are compensated appropriately for their
time

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.310 align:start position:0%
time
equipment

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature
 
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.570 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature
um

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
with that we heard from bail
 
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioners yesterday so I think we
 
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
have a pretty good idea we heard one
 
00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
person was owed 50 something thousand
 
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.890 align:start position:0%
person was owed 50 something thousand
dollars

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
from the state in just over a period of
 
00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
two years
 
00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 align:start position:0%
um obviously that's unacceptable we ask
 
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of these folks
 
00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
they're volunteers and we understand the
 
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
spirit of the volunteerism of New
 
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as all of us know we are also
 
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 align:start position:0%
volunteers but no one's asking us to
 
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
supply our own equipment our own paper
 
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
our own vehicles and mileage we get paid
 
00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 align:start position:0%
for mileage it makes it seems ridiculous
 
00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:31.610 align:start position:0%
for mileage it makes it seems ridiculous
that

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
some people who appear to be for the
 
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
most part retirees are expected to use
 
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
their small pay to
 
00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 align:start position:0%
not only
 
00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:43.979 align:start position:0%
support us
 
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
with their time but also their their
 
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
vehicles that you know the the gas
 
00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 align:start position:0%
prices just keep going up
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
um it's just unconscionable in my mind
 
00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:55.639 align:start position:0%
the way that they have been treated
 
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
especially in light of how important
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
they are to the system without them it
 
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
would it would literally come to a
 
00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 align:start position:0%
screeching halt so I'll open the floor
 
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
for a discussion if anyone would like to
 
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
speak on the topic or has any ideas or
 
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
thoughts I'll let you guys have at it
 
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.189 align:start position:0%
thoughts I'll let you guys have at it
first

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 align:start position:0%
representative roach thank you Mr
 
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
chairman so just coincidentally last
 
00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:19.139 align:start position:0%
evening I happened to be talking with
 
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
the police chief in one of my towns and
 
00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
he was telling me that in Cheshire
 
00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:25.979 align:start position:0%
County uh the best of his knowledge
 
00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:28.259 align:start position:0%
there is only one bill commissioner at
 
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:30.300 align:start position:0%
this point uh the other four are
 
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
permanently unavailable due to not being
 
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
not being paid um the forty dollars that
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
is required
 
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
so one you know one bail commissioner
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
for entire accounting I think is a is a
 
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
stretch his suggestion was putting it
 
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
indeed um and my concern is even that I
 
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
think we need a timeline
 
00:07:59.330 --> 00:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
um you know most people in this state
 
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
when you perform services or work you're
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
expected to be paid within two weeks of
 
00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:07.139 align:start position:0%
that work performed especially when you
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
have your own Financial outlays to be
 
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursed so I think we need to look at
 
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
the amount we need to look at the time
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
they're paid and the source of the
 
00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:18.249 align:start position:0%
they're paid and the source of the
funding

00:08:18.249 --> 00:08:18.259 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:21.780 align:start position:0%
anyone else represents Stone thank you
 
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
perhaps it might be something to look
 
00:08:29.089 --> 00:08:29.099 align:start position:0%
into if we would consider
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
billing per Bale and the state would
 
00:08:35.329 --> 00:08:35.339 align:start position:0%
actually pay per bail and then they'd be
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
reimbursed by either similar to Cost
 
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
Containment but I know that we've
 
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
discussed the Cost Containment may not
 
00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:42.659 align:start position:0%
be the proper entity for collection but
 
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
including the court fees that basically
 
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
the state would pay the bail
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
Commissioners per bail and then they the
 
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
state would recover the funds
 
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
I think that is a an excellent uh road
 
00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
to start going down I believe that the
 
00:08:59.329 --> 00:08:59.339 align:start position:0%
court has the ability to order someone
 
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
to pay whereas the bill commissioner
 
00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:02.660 align:start position:0%
does not
 
00:09:05.449 --> 00:09:05.459 align:start position:0%
so if the court pays the money up front
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
it's the Court's money to get back and I
 
00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
feel like they'd be more motivated to
 
00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:11.339 align:start position:0%
get their own money back than to get
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
money back for someone else so I think
 
00:09:15.949 --> 00:09:15.959 align:start position:0%
that that's a good starting point as far
 
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:19.740 align:start position:0%
as in the bill that we draft
 
00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:23.339 align:start position:0%
that we put in there that the bail
 
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
Commissioners will be paid by the court
 
00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:27.899 align:start position:0%
per bail and I would suggest that we put
 
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
a a two-week time limit for that to be
 
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.490 align:start position:0%
a a two-week time limit for that to be
processed

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
processed
 
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
depending on when they're submitted
 
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
then we order the court to collect it as
 
00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
they see fit based on the indigency or
 
00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:45.779 align:start position:0%
not of the the defendant that's their
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
determination to make if they feel like
 
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:50.220 align:start position:0%
they can get their money back or not
 
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
um we will of course have to put some
 
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
seed money
 
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
in that to give the course time to
 
00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:57.620 align:start position:0%
request it in their budget going forward
 
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
so we'll have to discuss one
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
how much to ask for
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
and going forward how that how that
 
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
structure would look
 
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
representative Muse did you have
 
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
it's interesting after having sat
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
through these hearings uh on on bail
 
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioners for uh all three of all
 
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
three of my terms
 
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:25.730 align:start position:0%
three of my terms
um

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
one of the things that strikes me is
 
00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:30.899 align:start position:0%
just how unusual the situation is with
 
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
Bill commissioner pay uh
 
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
it would be like asking policemen to
 
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
collect a fine from the people they
 
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:38.930 align:start position:0%
collect a fine from the people they
arrest

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
arrest
 
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
so and that that would be the way that
 
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
we actually pay police salaries
 
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:46.140 align:start position:0%
so I mean if you extrapolate the way
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
that we handle Bill commissioner pay uh
 
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
and you and you you sort of Transport
 
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839 align:start position:0%
that over to roles that may be more
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
familiar to us I think most people would
 
00:10:59.329 --> 00:10:59.339 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly come to the conclusion
 
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
that it really makes absolutely no sense
 
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:05.220 align:start position:0%
and that we do need a much better way if
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
we're if we're going to retain the bail
 
00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:09.779 align:start position:0%
commissioner system we need a way of
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
making sure that people are paid for the
 
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
service that they render they're paid
 
00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:18.980 align:start position:0%
consistently they're paid fairly
 
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
and even in a situation where people are
 
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
getting paid a hundred percent of the
 
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
time which which is not the situation
 
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.810 align:start position:0%
time which which is not the situation
now

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:28.820 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
we are still saving an incredible amount
 
00:11:35.449 --> 00:11:35.459 align:start position:0%
of money as a state by by having this
 
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
system and the longer that we let this
 
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
situation fester and it's been festering
 
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
for at least uh the the five years so
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
far that I've been in the legislature
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
the longer that we let this whole
 
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:50.420 align:start position:0%
situation Fester
 
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to have fewer and fewer
 
00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
experience Bill Commissioners and at
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
some point the whole thing just starts
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
to crash and we really will have no
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
choice but to look at another system so
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
at this point we do have a choice and
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
and I think it does start with making
 
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
sure that these folks are paid fairly
 
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.310 align:start position:0%
sure that these folks are paid fairly
inconsistently

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
I agree uh wholeheartedly representative
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
um Rhodes thank you Mr chair I just have
 
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
a follow-up to representative Stone's
 
00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
um suggestion which would be
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
there are several bail Commissioners
 
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
right now that are out
 
00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars and you know when
 
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
we go forward with this initiative
 
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:33.180 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that we you know come up
 
00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
with today or over the next several
 
00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:35.990 align:start position:0%
with today or over the next several
weeks

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
I think something we need to address is
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
are we moving forward from here as in
 
00:12:41.329 --> 00:12:41.339 align:start position:0%
you know it's still up to that bill
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner do what they need to do for
 
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
the for the pay that they're owed or are
 
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
we looking at somehow trying to make
 
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
right the wrongs that have been done
 
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
over the last
 
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
several years I think that's something
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
that obviously is going to be a
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
conversation so I think we need to be
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
proactive with how we're going to handle
 
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.610 align:start position:0%
proactive with how we're going to handle
it

00:12:58.610 --> 00:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
um I think that um best case scenario we
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
we would
 
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:05.220 align:start position:0%
um include in whatever funding we
 
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
request an amount to reimburse
 
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
outstanding debts to the bail
 
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.430 align:start position:0%
outstanding debts to the bail
commissioners

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
and have them start with a clean slate
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
if possible but right now when I think
 
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna need is um and perhaps
 
00:13:20.569 --> 00:13:20.579 align:start position:0%
representative scitec can help
 
00:13:20.579 --> 00:13:21.410 align:start position:0%
representative scitec can help
um

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
we need a kind of a number like in other
 
00:13:26.449 --> 00:13:26.459 align:start position:0%
words does anyone know exactly how many
 
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners we have
 
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:33.779 align:start position:0%
about how many Bales I mean and because
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
we have no I T system it's kind of
 
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
impossible to come up with that number
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
but we have to come up with a number to
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
ask for to be able to pay the bill
 
00:13:41.639 --> 00:13:42.889 align:start position:0%
ask for to be able to pay the bill
commissioners

00:13:42.889 --> 00:13:42.899 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:44.519 align:start position:0%
any input on that representative side
 
00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:45.829 align:start position:0%
any input on that representative side
Tech

00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
Tech
 
00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:49.139 align:start position:0%
almost none I don't want to say things I
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
don't know because I I only know Salem
 
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
Pelham Windham and our Dynamic so we
 
00:13:59.569 --> 00:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
have a pretty we're unusual in that
 
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
we're close geographically
 
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
so I don't spend a trip to one of these
 
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
places is basically takes five dollars
 
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
off of my bail not
 
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
because you really had to get there you
 
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
didn't walk
 
00:14:18.769 --> 00:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
and we have a pretty very good uh High
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
rate of return I it two out of ten is
 
00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
maybe it's one out of ten because we
 
00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
also get checks appear
 
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
semi periodically from the court by the
 
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
way I might add
 
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
where is the court I've not maybe
 
00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
they're watching but you'd think they'd
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
be here to have an ore in this water
 
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
okay so I I wish I could tell you more I
 
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
think my sense is
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking for me I don't know what Mr
 
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
Leary might want to say but going
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
forward correcting the situation I don't
 
00:14:56.569 --> 00:14:56.579 align:start position:0%
think we're looking I don't think
 
00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:58.740 align:start position:0%
anybody's looking for anything else but
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
get this straightened out
 
00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
if I may because this I I don't want to
 
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
talk much but I do want to throw this in
 
00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:08.519 align:start position:0%
because we're looking at the overall
 
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
bail situation
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
and the Roman censor Cato ended every
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
speech no matter what it was about with
 
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:20.220 align:start position:0%
carthago delenda est Carthage must be
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
destroyed and I want to end everything I
 
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
talk about with we need a training
 
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
program or I'm talking with Mr Leary
 
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
about how he handles it we handle it
 
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
District Court tells us something in
 
00:15:35.329 --> 00:15:35.339 align:start position:0%
October another District Court tells us
 
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
something else these it's like a golf
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
course with local ground rules well wait
 
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
a minute this is a system of justice I
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not comfortable with that I
 
00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:49.139 align:start position:0%
look when I'm a bail commissioner I
 
00:15:51.889 --> 00:15:51.899 align:start position:0%
follow the rules I don't follow what how
 
00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
I might vote in the house or what my
 
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
personal preference is I represent a
 
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
system and everybody is Mr they're every
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
one of them as far as I'm concerned
 
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
guilty who cares I represent a system
 
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
and they're treated I tell them I'll
 
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
I'll stop here uh you showed up you're
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
acting like a business we treat you like
 
00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
a business may not be a business you
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
want to be in but please keep up the
 
00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:19.100 align:start position:0%
good work
 
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your input
 
00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:25.139 align:start position:0%
um sir would you like to maybe address
 
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
the issue of the number of bail
 
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
Commissioners uh how many are in your
 
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
area emergency
 
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
we have four in our area uh one is
 
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
semi-active three actives do you have
 
00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
any concept or idea of how many the
 
00:16:44.689 --> 00:16:44.699 align:start position:0%
state we have is it I I've heard from
 
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
people more involved by the way amazing
 
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
you know Trixie with fed that's about
 
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
here I'm on the condo board with a
 
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
relative of hers and through marriage I
 
00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
was at a meeting last night I'm trying
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
to talk him into a bail commissioner
 
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
because they need one in either for her
 
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try to talk her back into
 
00:17:10.449 --> 00:17:10.459 align:start position:0%
it or uh for the dairy Londonderry
 
00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
Manchester area
 
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
um so I think Mr Leary can probably tell
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
you more than I can about that or I'm
 
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
kind of insular I know what I know but I
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
don't know more than I know gotcha sir
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman again for the
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
record my name is Paul Leary I'm a bail
 
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner and pointed out of Franklin
 
00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.789 align:start position:0%
commissioner and pointed out of Franklin
Court

00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
Court
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
and I am the only one appointed out of
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
the Franklin Court however we have
 
00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
several from the Laconia District Court
 
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
that cover as well as a couple out of
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
the Concord Court
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
pre-covered we had approximately 120
 
00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:01.860 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners it was what I was
 
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:02.810 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners it was what I was
told

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
told
 
00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
posts covid the first round it was down
 
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
to 100 and currently from the scuttlebut
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
we're hearing it's about 85 now and
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
people are doing what's called The Quiet
 
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
retiring on either the Justice of the
 
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
Peace Commission expires or the bail
 
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:23.220 align:start position:0%
Commissioners expires they just don't
 
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
renew it and they just disappear and
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes people move and the Court's
 
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
not aware of that until if they have to
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
have an annual meeting and then we
 
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
happen to be talking oh no they went to
 
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
Florida two years ago so the thing is
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's why we're figuring about 85 and
 
00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:43.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.409 --> 00:18:45.419 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
um you've heard what we're talking about
 
00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with a an amount to
 
00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:52.140 align:start position:0%
seed this this program of making the
 
00:18:54.409 --> 00:18:54.419 align:start position:0%
courts have to pay
 
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
um do you have any concept of how many
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
Bales are conducted per year and I know
 
00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:03.059 align:start position:0%
it's see the court the court system will
 
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
be able to tell you that because they
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
record all of that stuff because they
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
have to but it's individual courts
 
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
there's no I'm sure the courts have
 
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
because they have the administrative
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
office of the courts I would hope in
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
this day and age that they've been
 
00:19:21.289 --> 00:19:21.299 align:start position:0%
reporting monthly their activity to the
 
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
court so they'd have the totals where
 
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
did the checks come out of
 
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
the checks that you get where did they
 
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:29.220 align:start position:0%
come out of
 
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know they come in an envelope in
 
00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:32.220 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire right it's
 
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
like they don't they don't come very
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
often no I I'm just trying to I figure
 
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
someone I can call and say could you
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
tell me how many bills you've done last
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
year I said that ingested my last
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
training in Laconia which was the best
 
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
one in seven years and all of a sudden
 
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
in the next two weeks I got like eight
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
or nine checks from the court and then
 
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
it was crickets for a long time well
 
00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
perhaps this will generate a few more
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
chats but here's the problem
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
again I told you yesterday will we fall
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
in the scope of things we understand
 
00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
that but the bail commissioner's fee is
 
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
tagged on after everything goes to the
 
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
court so the very last payment that the
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
defendant makes whether it happened to
 
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
be six months a year five years or ten
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
years then we get our check yeah we need
 
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
to be at the front end yeah but I think
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
our representative over there was headed
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
in the correct direction but don't limit
 
00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
it to them to every two weeks it's just
 
00:20:30.409 --> 00:20:30.419 align:start position:0%
whatever the bail Commissioners put in
 
00:20:33.169 --> 00:20:33.179 align:start position:0%
in a two-week period they report it for
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
the next period we get paid and that's
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
what I meant by that but from my and I'm
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
speaking just on my behalf not anyone
 
00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.210 align:start position:0%
speaking just on my behalf not anyone
else

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
it would be ridiculous to think at this
 
00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
point because some of us I've only been
 
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
doing it seven and a half years and I
 
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
showed you I'm at over fifty one
 
00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:49.789 align:start position:0%
showed you I'm at over fifty one
thousand

00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
but since I typed that up I've done
 
00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:54.179 align:start position:0%
about seven Bales and I've only been
 
00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
paid for one out of the seven so that
 
00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
number's going on it's like the deficit
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
clock that's yeah it's kind of like that
 
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
and if you want to make this happen in
 
00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
reality we're trying to take care of
 
00:21:06.289 --> 00:21:06.299 align:start position:0%
today and the future
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's the past and when I
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
came on Judge Gordon told me I'd be paid
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
for three out of five
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
that's 60 I told you I've been
 
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
collecting 62 to 68 so what he told me
 
00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
back in March of 2016 is held true so
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
the thing is I knew that when I came
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
into it what I like that
 
00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:29.220 align:start position:0%
absolutely would my wife like it even
 
00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
better absolutely but I considered it a
 
00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
hobby in a way so the thing is that's
 
00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
from my standpoint but let's fix it for
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
today and going forward then later on if
 
00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
someone wins the lotto and gives it to
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
the state to pay off all the bail
 
00:21:45.409 --> 00:21:45.419 align:start position:0%
Commissioners we'll gladly take it but
 
00:21:48.049 --> 00:21:48.059 align:start position:0%
let's fix it for today and go forward to
 
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
the future well I like to aim high and
 
00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
see where we end up oh absolutely
 
00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
um so here's the problem and I hope the
 
00:21:58.909 --> 00:21:58.919 align:start position:0%
com everyone's listening so even if I
 
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
were to be able to call and say okay so
 
00:22:03.529 --> 00:22:03.539 align:start position:0%
how many bails did you pay for that
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't tell us how many bills were
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
actually done because they're not paying
 
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
for all the bills so
 
00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to see if there's a way and
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
I'm going to representative SCI text
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
point I'm gonna have to call the court
 
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.310 align:start position:0%
point I'm gonna have to call the court
and

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
see if there's a way for them to figure
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
out how many bales were done last year
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
in total well and I suspect they won't
 
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
be able to tell me
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
I think they may because say like the
 
00:22:30.169 --> 00:22:30.179 align:start position:0%
electronic bench warrants I go and I do
 
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
one defendant like I told you the one I
 
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
had he had nine electronic bench
 
00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
warrants there were seven different
 
00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
courts but each one of those nine
 
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
because they were electronic bench
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
warrant required a bond
 
00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
that what you need to know form two more
 
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
pages and the Circuit Court bail order
 
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
form so there were five pages for each
 
00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
one so 45 pages of paperwork seven
 
00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
envelopes seven stamps and if it went
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
over four pages you needed the fifth
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
stamp on that just to give you an idea
 
00:22:58.909 --> 00:22:58.919 align:start position:0%
of cost time spent was about five maybe
 
00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
six hours total time between going there
 
00:23:03.649 --> 00:23:03.659 align:start position:0%
coming that and finishing up addressing
 
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
all the envelopes and then the cost that
 
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't count going to the post office
 
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
dropping them off going to the bank
 
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
making the deposits writing the checks
 
00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
again we have to pay for our own checks
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
to write to the court too so yeah it's
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of cost involved but we're
 
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
only allowed to correct one bail
 
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
per call doesn't matter how much we have
 
00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
to do or how long we're there
 
00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
so if you get one call to one city and
 
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
there's six defendants to be billed you
 
00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
would get be able to bill for all of
 
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
them correct that's a different story
 
00:23:39.649 --> 00:23:39.659 align:start position:0%
matter of fact had that happened the
 
00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
other night five
 
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
young gentleman out partying all under
 
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
the age of 21. so that was one of those
 
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
gold mines so yeah it doesn't happen
 
00:23:51.169 --> 00:23:51.179 align:start position:0%
very often
 
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
they all had the money and it was like
 
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
that was a surprise too and it was one
 
00:23:58.130 --> 00:23:58.140 align:start position:0%
of those Christmas came early 1 30 in
 
00:23:59.930 --> 00:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
the morning so the thing is it does
 
00:24:03.289 --> 00:24:03.299 align:start position:0%
happen and uh since taking starting to
 
00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:05.940 align:start position:0%
take credit cards that helped a lot
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
especially doing the remote bailing
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
because I'll be honest I've got to go
 
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
over to Bradford I've got five envelopes
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
over there I got to pick up I've got
 
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
three in Whitefield I've got one down
 
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:16.860 align:start position:0%
somewhere in Rockingham County in the
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
middle of nowhere not easy to get to
 
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
it's been there for three years I'll get
 
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
there eventually but it's not that and
 
00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:24.539 align:start position:0%
that's one of the biggest problems about
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
remote bailing but the worst part is if
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
it's a cash bail
 
00:24:30.529 --> 00:24:30.539 align:start position:0%
that's like Plymouth won't hold the
 
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
money and dispatch even until the next
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
morning to come up and get it
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
then I just don't call
 
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
it's like I don't want to be driving at
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
night in really bad weather because I'm
 
00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
reaching that age where Mike probably
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be and you got to understand
 
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
that and know it so it's like it's not
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
that I don't want to do it but it's like
 
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
hey guys you got to work with me halfway
 
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
you want me to do it I'll do it hang on
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
to the money and I'll come up but
 
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
they're worried about it
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
put it in a Gun Locker take the key out
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
yeah it seems we heard that yesterday
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
that bail money that isn't for the bail
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner's fee seems to be being
 
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
treated like a hot potato nobody wants
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
to hold it or take it well you can
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
understand in this day and age because
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
the thing is if it disappears who's
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
reliable forward or responsible for it
 
00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:18.780 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean it's the same with the jails
 
00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:20.780 align:start position:0%
like the jails we have to go out to
 
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
Merrimack County Jail the round trip is
 
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
16.6 miles it's doable in any kind of
 
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:28.740 align:start position:0%
weather except when the trees come down
 
00:25:30.289 --> 00:25:30.299 align:start position:0%
across the road that just makes it a
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
little difficult okay so okay thank you
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
any anyone have a question uh
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative Stone
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if you have the information
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
on this or not but one of the things
 
00:25:42.169 --> 00:25:42.179 align:start position:0%
we're seeing in a lot of other avenues
 
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
is the lack of Volunteers in certain age
 
00:25:45.529 --> 00:25:45.539 align:start position:0%
groups do we have any Bill commissions
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
that you're aware of that are actually
 
00:25:51.769 --> 00:25:51.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
so the best of my knowledge and belief
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
at this juncture or time I would say in
 
00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
the negative but I don't know for sure
 
00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:00.900 align:start position:0%
thank you was that evasive enough that
 
00:26:03.649 --> 00:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
that is is enough to say that probably
 
00:26:03.659 --> 00:26:04.610 align:start position:0%
that is is enough to say that probably
not

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
um so again though but
 
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
the nature of this job is difficult for
 
00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
someone who has a full-time job and the
 
00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:16.860 align:start position:0%
family or you know pets it's just it's
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
it would be very difficult so I can
 
00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
understand the the age group but at the
 
00:26:24.529 --> 00:26:24.539 align:start position:0%
same time that that's incenses me more
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
that we're taking advantage of them so
 
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair yes I could just inject on
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
that uh when I first came on there was a
 
00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:35.460 align:start position:0%
young lady she was probably in her 40s
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
who trained me
 
00:26:39.769 --> 00:26:39.779 align:start position:0%
and she was happy I came on she says you
 
00:26:42.289 --> 00:26:42.299 align:start position:0%
can take care of the evening and the
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
nights I'll take care of the days
 
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:46.740 align:start position:0%
because of where her job fell that
 
00:26:48.769 --> 00:26:48.779 align:start position:0%
worked out well
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
so the thing is there are some people
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
out there that are willing to do you
 
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
know like School shift type things and
 
00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
in this day and age
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the court system would be
 
00:26:59.930 --> 00:26:59.940 align:start position:0%
willing to take someone if they had six
 
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
or eight hours a day that they could
 
00:27:03.769 --> 00:27:03.779 align:start position:0%
give because the thing is the system is
 
00:27:06.049 --> 00:27:06.059 align:start position:0%
stretched and I told you I bailed nine
 
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
counties the one County I don't have and
 
00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
I'm not interested to jump into it the
 
00:27:12.049 --> 00:27:12.059 align:start position:0%
Cheshire county for the reason the fact
 
00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:13.940 align:start position:0%
is they only have one
 
00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:24.299 align:start position:0%
um to your best to your knowledge or are
 
00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
you representing scitec how long is the
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
the fee been forty dollars
 
00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
since 2008 2008
 
00:27:36.529 --> 00:27:36.539 align:start position:0%
that was in your report of 2019. okay
 
00:27:36.539 --> 00:27:38.149 align:start position:0%
that was in your report of 2019. okay
um

00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
how does the committee feel about uh
 
00:27:42.529 --> 00:27:42.539 align:start position:0%
increasing that to 50 I mean the 10
 
00:27:45.649 --> 00:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
increase over what um that number of
 
00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
years with the I know representative
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
scitex probably about to say no let's
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
just stay with the 40 but go ahead I'll
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
say that I'll say that but what we'd
 
00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:58.140 align:start position:0%
prefer I think isn't an increase but I
 
00:28:00.289 --> 00:28:00.299 align:start position:0%
think they would prefer because I'm
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
lucky I just to be paid it all by the
 
00:28:06.169 --> 00:28:06.179 align:start position:0%
way Salem does shifts that's how we
 
00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
handle it that's so one week is
 
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
destroyed you're you are 24 7 for one
 
00:28:15.409 --> 00:28:15.419 align:start position:0%
week then you're offered uh I think we I
 
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
think they we would appreciate the
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
Assurance of the forty dollars not 50
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
Chancey as I said I I um I believe that
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
we can walk and chew gum at the same
 
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
time and I think that um it's it's a sad
 
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
State of Affairs that you have to settle
 
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:34.140 align:start position:0%
for something less than would be
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate just so that you have
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
something at all
 
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
um so I would like if the committee
 
00:28:42.409 --> 00:28:42.419 align:start position:0%
agrees to try and shoot for fifty
 
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
dollars I mean we still have to
 
00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
negotiate with the Senate and but I'd
 
00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
like to start a little high so that if
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
we do end up back at the 40 at least we
 
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:56.820 align:start position:0%
representative Stone
 
00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you I would support the 50 I think
 
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
that'd be a much easier Revenue source
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
to go with than to deal with mileage
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
where if you included mileage it'd be a
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
more problematic and more comprehensive
 
00:29:10.669 --> 00:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
staff time and document time and
 
00:29:12.409 --> 00:29:12.419 align:start position:0%
Reporting time I think a straight 50
 
00:29:14.029 --> 00:29:14.039 align:start position:0%
would be keeping it very clean and
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
should be a little more palatable for
 
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
the other entities that are involved in
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
this I I was thinking the same way
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
because mileage I think that they should
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
get mileage but to your point that
 
00:29:27.649 --> 00:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
requires Court staff processing and so
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
every everything we do is throwing a
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
pebble in a pond and the ripples go out
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
represent scitec
 
00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
um I have I have customers from both
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions from Massachusetts and
 
00:29:40.799 --> 00:29:42.830 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions from Massachusetts and
from

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:44.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I've done some
 
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:46.520 align:start position:0%
comparison shopping
 
00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:48.860 align:start position:0%
you should be aware Massachusetts
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
charges 40. and so I you know I don't
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
know that we care about what they do but
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's a point of reference the other
 
00:30:00.769 --> 00:30:00.779 align:start position:0%
thing is it's done by the clerk of court
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
yes in Massachusetts and many
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
I don't want to exaggerate I've heard
 
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
several times
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
my customers my clients my restees thank
 
00:30:15.889 --> 00:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
me for the promptness by which we get
 
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
there we had to wait eight hours in
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so yeah it's done by the
 
00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
clerks and they have they do have bail
 
00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:24.769 align:start position:0%
clerks and they have they do have bail
Commissioners

00:30:24.769 --> 00:30:24.779 align:start position:0%
Commissioners
 
00:30:27.049 --> 00:30:27.059 align:start position:0%
um but it the clerk of courts in the
 
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
local Town usually handles it and you do
 
00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
have to wait for a bail commission if
 
00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
the clerk does not want to get out of
 
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
bed so there's that and I don't believe
 
00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:37.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure the clerk of courts is
 
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
salaried anyway quite handsomely in
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I may have
 
00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know if they get that 40
 
00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919 align:start position:0%
on top of that or if it goes to some
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
victim witness who knows sir yeah go
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
ahead representative means
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
you know one of the things that we've
 
00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
also heard in in some of the other
 
00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.529 align:start position:0%
also heard in in some of the other
sessions

00:30:57.529 --> 00:30:57.539 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
um uh and this is from from the court
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
system was just the unusual status of
 
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners
 
00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
um they're not employees of the court
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
system they're not really contractors of
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
the court system
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
um they're volunteers who for the most
 
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
part are are inconsistently trained uh I
 
00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:19.860 align:start position:0%
know a few years ago in the commission
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
that we had on bail commissioner pay one
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
of our recommendations was to try to
 
00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:26.220 align:start position:0%
professionalize it a little bit by
 
00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
making sure that bill Commissioners at
 
00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:30.779 align:start position:0%
least got ID cards state ID cards and
 
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we heard
 
00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
yesterday was somehow that got
 
00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
translated into a computer printout with
 
00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
a little tiny picture at the top that
 
00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
these folks are supposed to drag along
 
00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:45.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
so I mean part part of it is I I think
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
one of the things that that just always
 
00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:55.980 align:start position:0%
strikes me about these hearings is how
 
00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
critical the role is and and what a
 
00:32:00.769 --> 00:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
critical role they play in the in in the
 
00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
but there just seems to have been a A
 
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:07.799 align:start position:0%
continuing refusal on the part of the
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
court system to really do much of
 
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
anything to professionalize the role
 
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
um and and I think these are people who
 
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
really regard themselves as being
 
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
professionals and they take care of you
 
00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:23.940 align:start position:0%
know a lot of that kind of activity
 
00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
themselves I think you know the vast
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
majority are very responsible people
 
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
but the but the fact that they're
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
essentially treated like the poor step
 
00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:37.799 align:start position:0%
children of the judicial system
 
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:40.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't really serve the people of New
 
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:43.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or them
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
um very well given the kind of
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
sacrifices that they make to do the job
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
so you know the bottom line is if we're
 
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
going to have a system that depends on
 
00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:55.340 align:start position:0%
folks like this
 
00:32:59.149 --> 00:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
those folks need to be able to depend on
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
the system to at least make sure they
 
00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:04.919 align:start position:0%
get paid they get properly trained and
 
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:07.140 align:start position:0%
that there are Professional Standards
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
that they can comply with and shoot to
 
00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:11.940 align:start position:0%
aim for and I mean
 
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't see you know I was in
 
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
business for a long time I don't see how
 
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
you recruit anybody to a role where
 
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
they're inconsistently paid where
 
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
not only is it a situation where they
 
00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
may or not get get paid there's a
 
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
certain amount of personal risk involved
 
00:33:34.009 --> 00:33:34.019 align:start position:0%
and driving to these locations at night
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
through snowstorms and things things
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
like that when they get there they find
 
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
that the handbook uh that's supposed to
 
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
be their Bible hasn't been updated since
 
00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:46.380 align:start position:0%
2019 and I think one of the things you
 
00:33:48.649 --> 00:33:48.659 align:start position:0%
were saying is the the 2019 version
 
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
isn't accessible on the on the website
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
or the 2020 version
 
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
so I mean this is this is just really
 
00:33:55.799 --> 00:33:57.710 align:start position:0%
so I mean this is this is just really
inexcusable

00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
inexcusable
 
00:34:00.169 --> 00:34:00.179 align:start position:0%
um and uh it it's just something we need
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
to fix
 
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
agreed and and to the uh to I don't want
 
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
to you know just like I said yesterday I
 
00:34:09.649 --> 00:34:09.659 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to bail Commissioners to
 
00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
feel like they needed to be defensive I
 
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
would like to to extend the same thing
 
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
to the court
 
00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
um I spoke to the new um uh liaison to
 
00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
the legislature a week ago
 
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
um she's also the general counsel and
 
00:34:25.369 --> 00:34:25.379 align:start position:0%
she's very open to all of this
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
um and right now I'm working on setting
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
up a meeting with the Chief Justice
 
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
who's open to the meeting so um I feel
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
like you know we have a a little bit of
 
00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:36.419 align:start position:0%
a different court system we're dealing
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
with just like we're a different
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
legislature with the new chief justice
 
00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:42.419 align:start position:0%
is kind of taken over and and wrapping
 
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
his arms around everything so this is
 
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:46.919 align:start position:0%
the perfect time I think so um we're I
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
believe we'll be able to address these
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
issues and the court we'll see hear them
 
00:34:55.129 --> 00:34:55.139 align:start position:0%
with an open mind and what we want to do
 
00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
and it's difficult for the court to be
 
00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:57.950 align:start position:0%
and it's difficult for the court to be
here

00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:01.140 align:start position:0%
because they have to stay out of policy
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
um it would be great if they were here
 
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
as a resource to give us information but
 
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
I feel like
 
00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
um we're getting all we need directly
 
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:11.700 align:start position:0%
from The Source on this on this matter
 
00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
and we'll bring that to the um to the
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
courts with our proposals I think what's
 
00:35:20.089 --> 00:35:20.099 align:start position:0%
important what we need to do is
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
go to the court and say this is what
 
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
we're thinking is this workable and if
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
not why not and how much do you need sir
 
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
go ahead just to answer something that
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
representative news brought up is when
 
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
we came on we were told we were not
 
00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
employees yes that we are independent
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
contractors and we receive a 1099 at the
 
00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:44.700 align:start position:0%
end of the year we are officers of the
 
00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:47.460 align:start position:0%
Court inferior but we are officers of
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
the Court Justice is justice of the
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
peace is and that's even further down
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
the line yes and that's one of the
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
benefits of having you because we don't
 
00:35:58.250 --> 00:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
have to pay you benefits we don't have
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
to so that's that's the reason that the
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
1099 in the contractor that being said
 
00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:06.839 align:start position:0%
there's no reason that we can't give our
 
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
contractors what they need to do the job
 
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:11.700 align:start position:0%
that we are Contracting them to do
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
okay so I think we have something to add
 
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
oh yes sir go ahead Mr prayer uh
 
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
representative you talked earlier about
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
swearing him in I don't think that would
 
00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
go against anything not being part of
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
the system if we could swear them in and
 
00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
also along with that a simple laminated
 
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
ID because they're going into police
 
00:36:29.089 --> 00:36:29.099 align:start position:0%
stations and sensitive parts of the
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
buildings and courts and everything else
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
they ought to have a little
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
to buy his license type ID that they can
 
00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:37.140 align:start position:0%
wear on their neck to show that they're
 
00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
part of the system and not part of the
 
00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:40.790 align:start position:0%
part of the system and not part of the
problem

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
agree let's take a just a quick informal
 
00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
vote 50 is everyone okay for shooting
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
for fifty dollars
 
00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
thank you and they're putting in like
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
six hours they're getting like eight
 
00:37:01.849 --> 00:37:01.859 align:start position:0%
dollars and can we do better then I
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
would rather not try to do better I I
 
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.210 align:start position:0%
would rather not try to do better I I
agree

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:05.220 align:start position:0%
agree
 
00:37:07.609 --> 00:37:07.619 align:start position:0%
um but we have to look at what first of
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
all we're how much is the court going to
 
00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:12.180 align:start position:0%
be able to get back first you know with
 
00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:14.940 align:start position:0%
with a large percentage of the of the
 
00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
defendants being indigent
 
00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
the courts aren't going to be able to
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
get that money back so it's going to end
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
up being funded at a general fund every
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
year in a budget so we have to really be
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
careful with that I think if we could
 
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
get 50 we can come back later
 
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
um let's let's get a beachhead and once
 
00:37:32.089 --> 00:37:32.099 align:start position:0%
we take the beach head we can advance so
 
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
I think 50 is a as you heard from
 
00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
representative he's nervous that might
 
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
be a bridge too far
 
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
um but we're going to start with that
 
00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
but your point is well taken so we we
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
have an informal agreement on shooting
 
00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
for 50.
 
00:37:49.069 --> 00:37:49.079 align:start position:0%
um to representative Pratt's point do we
 
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
have an agreement on directing the court
 
00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
to make a uh to make a agreement enter
 
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
into an agreement with the DMV to
 
00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.849 align:start position:0%
into an agreement with the DMV to
provide

00:37:58.849 --> 00:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:37:58.859 --> 00:38:01.910 align:start position:0%
provide
um identification

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
also do we have an agreement on doing
 
00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
whatever we need to make sure that they
 
00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:11.220 align:start position:0%
are sworn
 
00:38:15.069 --> 00:38:15.079 align:start position:0%
such that they are able to access
 
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
FBI and criminal justice information
 
00:38:19.849 --> 00:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
representative Stone
 
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I my memory served me
 
00:38:23.329 --> 00:38:23.339 align:start position:0%
correctly I think that's more of an
 
00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
issue not being sworn but completing the
 
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
required training
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
to be certified now I think there's
 
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
probably a couple of things let's do we
 
00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
agree that we need to do whatever we
 
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
need to do to ensure that they have
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
access to criminal justice information
 
00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
yes does everyone agree to that
 
00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.530 align:start position:0%
yes does everyone agree to that
information

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:41.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
that would probably be one of the
 
00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
justices if they had to be sworn of Mr
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
Sure yes sir correct me if I'm wrong but
 
00:38:50.089 --> 00:38:50.099 align:start position:0%
it isn't all bail commissions have to be
 
00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
Justice of the Peace yes so they're
 
00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
they're assets yeah in other words we
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
fill out two applications one is a
 
00:38:58.730 --> 00:38:58.740 align:start position:0%
Justice of the piece one to be a bail
 
00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
commissioner we have to go get four
 
00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:02.940 align:start position:0%
people to sign off that we're
 
00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
Representatives we have the state police
 
00:39:07.609 --> 00:39:07.619 align:start position:0%
background check so we're basically
 
00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
twice in the five-year period of our
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
appointment we've been a background
 
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
check has been done because you have to
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
take a note of office of any kind yeah I
 
00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
have to sign off especially as a Justice
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
of the Peace the bail commissioner is
 
00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
more based on the fact to be
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
a bail commissioner you have to be a
 
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
Justice of the Peace so we're already
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
sworn okay okay but the thing is to
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
sieges this is where you have to be
 
00:39:32.089 --> 00:39:32.099 align:start position:0%
careful this is this is the federal
 
00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
government right and it has to do with
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
peace officers basically in other words
 
00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
you're a police you're an executive
 
00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
branch we're in the judicial branch
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
however in sieges
 
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners are allowed to review
 
00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
I can't possess they can't send me an
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
email or a fax or any of that because I
 
00:39:55.609 --> 00:39:55.619 align:start position:0%
don't meet the criteria but because of
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
the job functionality I do I'm allowed
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
to review it
 
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
okay we're gonna we're gonna look into
 
00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:05.579 align:start position:0%
that and see if there's I know
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
probations allowed to see and hold and
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
have but this one and they have I
 
00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:13.140 align:start position:0%
believe the power of arrest because they
 
00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
can take people into into custody it is
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
a good point
 
00:40:19.609 --> 00:40:19.619 align:start position:0%
um okay so for the committee I'm looking
 
00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:22.740 align:start position:0%
to seeing what what level if if possible
 
00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
that they would be able to access
 
00:40:26.329 --> 00:40:26.339 align:start position:0%
criminal records
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
on their own from a secure terminal of
 
00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
some type
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
um so we're going to put a pin in that
 
00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.030 align:start position:0%
um so we're going to put a pin in that
also

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.710 align:start position:0%
also
um

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:41.569 --> 00:40:41.579 align:start position:0%
with regard to that I would propose that
 
00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
we ask for a limited number of
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
amount of money to onboard these folks
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
when they come aboard
 
00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
you know they they have to have I mean
 
00:40:55.849 --> 00:40:55.859 align:start position:0%
and correct me if I'm wrong you need a
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
cell phone
 
00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
you need some type of a laptop iPad
 
00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.210 align:start position:0%
you need some type of a laptop iPad
something

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:02.220 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
um but I mean what what type of
 
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
equipment do you I mean you're spending
 
00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
a lot out of your own Pockets to do this
 
00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
efficiently now and I don't mean Bare
 
00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
Bones to do it efficiently when I
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
and I had my own cell phone
 
00:41:22.849 --> 00:41:22.859 align:start position:0%
they did provide me copies I'd go in and
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
I'd periodically get 10 or 15 but it's
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes inevitably when I needed
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
something they were busy so it got to a
 
00:41:32.089 --> 00:41:32.099 align:start position:0%
point it was more convenient just to
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
make my own and just go from there over
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
time as we aged arthritis and whatnot
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
and I was taking a look at my
 
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
handwriting and since I was complaining
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
about Judges handwriting so we couldn't
 
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
read on the bail orders I figured it was
 
00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
time to Pony up I got my iPad I got a
 
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
program that allowed me to go in and be
 
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
able to utilize the state forms as they
 
00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:53.270 align:start position:0%
able to utilize the state forms as they
were

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
and sold with sure and then they started
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
putting them out on the website and we
 
00:41:59.810 --> 00:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
were able to download them and work with
 
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
them and I type all of that so over time
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
just myself because I wanted to put
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
forward a more professional and more
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
importantly I didn't want the defendant
 
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:10.740 align:start position:0%
to be able to say that I couldn't read
 
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
what they wrote
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
and have that as a loophole
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
and just to be clear I'm not going to
 
00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
propose that we vote an amount of money
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going this is for me to when I meet
 
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
with the Chief Justice to say
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
what do you think about
 
00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
providing your contractors with
 
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
something to start them up it'd be it
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
some kind of a startup package
 
00:42:37.849 --> 00:42:37.859 align:start position:0%
we talked about it you put it as a
 
00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
bridge too far
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
you have to in my view you have to ask
 
00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:44.420 align:start position:0%
for something that's reasonable
 
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
everybody has a cell phone
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
everybody has a computer I don't use a
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
computer I use the police facilities
 
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
copying Mr Leary does it himself I find
 
00:42:58.130 --> 00:42:58.140 align:start position:0%
the police departments are very
 
00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
Cooperative about letting me make my
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
copies there so I think that is
 
00:43:08.329 --> 00:43:08.339 align:start position:0%
I want to keep any request that this
 
00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
committee makes
 
00:43:13.609 --> 00:43:13.619 align:start position:0%
uh reasonable and I think people may nod
 
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
their heads but they're not going to
 
00:43:17.569 --> 00:43:17.579 align:start position:0%
believe that we have to provide cell
 
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
phones or something and that's just
 
00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
operating equipment for everybody
 
00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:22.670 align:start position:0%
operating equipment for everybody
but

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
the big thing that should be on that
 
00:43:28.569 --> 00:43:28.579 align:start position:0%
list mother Heavens is it training
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
that's got to be I mean I I sorry
 
00:43:34.079 --> 00:43:35.870 align:start position:0%
that's got to be I mean I I sorry
oh

00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
remember we are independent contractors
 
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
we bring our own tools to the job and I
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
agree with representative scitec I think
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
that's definitely more than a bridge
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's like three or four or five bridges
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
too far
 
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
especially to equip that amount of
 
00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:52.190 align:start position:0%
especially to equip that amount of
people

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
but I Echo hit what he said is training
 
00:43:58.010 --> 00:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
and where the court was willing to go
 
00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
out and hire one person to train 15
 
00:44:00.359 --> 00:44:01.910 align:start position:0%
out and hire one person to train 15
magistrates

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
magistrates
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
I think or the moment the bill that was
 
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
put in is that hired that same person
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
and have them train the bail
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and that means new bail
 
00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that come in they meet
 
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:16.140 align:start position:0%
with that person that is designed to do
 
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
the training set it up and give them the
 
00:44:20.329 --> 00:44:20.339 align:start position:0%
basic training then they go out and
 
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
Shadow a bail commissioner actually
 
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
doing the work out in the field I think
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
would be you know miles ahead and again
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
looking to the Future so that other
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
people that would sit here before you
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
would be appropriately you know trained
 
00:44:37.609 --> 00:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
and have the
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
respect so to speak of the office and
 
00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
not be treated as an afterthought I
 
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
think those are the important things and
 
00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
by the training alone I think it UPS the
 
00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
professionalism of the group you're
 
00:44:50.569 --> 00:44:50.579 align:start position:0%
fortunate that you have a huge
 
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
professional group but there's some too
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
like with every group that could need a
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
little bit more help in that area
 
00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
so in in that
 
00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
vein just so um represents scitec
 
00:45:06.109 --> 00:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to bring it up again we all
 
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
agree that whatever we pass is going to
 
00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:11.300 align:start position:0%
require and just as a side note
 
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
generally speaking we wouldn't tell
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
another branch of government what to do
 
00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
with their employees but they're not
 
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:22.140 align:start position:0%
their employees so I I feel very
 
00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
comfortable since they are serving both
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
the judicial executive
 
00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
we we can as the legislature say what
 
00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
they they need so everyone agrees
 
00:45:35.329 --> 00:45:35.339 align:start position:0%
training should be part of onboarding
 
00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
and at least annually or more often if
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
the laws are changed that require it is
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:50.329 --> 00:45:50.339 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
oh I was just going to say when it comes
 
00:45:54.589 --> 00:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
to the laptops and stuff maybe this is
 
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
something we put off depending on how
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
you know the rest of this conversation
 
00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
goes but maybe it could be more of a
 
00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:04.140 align:start position:0%
reimbursement system instead of upfront
 
00:46:05.809 --> 00:46:05.819 align:start position:0%
providing people with the technology
 
00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:07.740 align:start position:0%
they need that way if people you know
 
00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:10.140 align:start position:0%
don't have an iPad or a laptop that day
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
or if it breaks you know they're able to
 
00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:13.079 align:start position:0%
get one
 
00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
um I employ independent contractors and
 
00:46:16.609 --> 00:46:16.619 align:start position:0%
I give them mileage reimbursement and
 
00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for you know costs that
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
they spend to complete the job
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
I also was going to say that if we're
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
looking into allowing them to you know
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
access criminal records and stuff like
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
that then maybe it does have to be a
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
state issued laptop so I think that's
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
something we also need to think about I
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
think that that that issue I'm going to
 
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
address with the Chief Justice and
 
00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.450 align:start position:0%
address with the Chief Justice and
so

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:44.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
into the to the two bail Commissioners
 
00:46:49.849 --> 00:46:49.859 align:start position:0%
uh president's point if I was going to
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
suggest that we fund
 
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
um some kind of a startup package they I
 
00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:56.460 align:start position:0%
agree that
 
00:46:58.609 --> 00:46:58.619 align:start position:0%
because it's such an ethereal thing you
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
know some people need it some people
 
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.069 align:start position:0%
know some people need it some people
don't

00:47:01.069 --> 00:47:01.079 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
but if we talk to the Chief Justice to
 
00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:04.740 align:start position:0%
say look
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
what do you think what what would be
 
00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:11.339 align:start position:0%
appropriate in your mind even to your
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
point of reimbursement type of system
 
00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
that we could put seed money into start
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
that they could fund out of their budget
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
when they ask for a new budget so
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
that'll just be part of the conversation
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
I have with the court I don't think it's
 
00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:25.740 align:start position:0%
something we'll necessarily try to
 
00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
mandate to legislation unless the court
 
00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
agrees to it representative Stone thank
 
00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:31.370 align:start position:0%
agrees to it representative Stone thank
you

00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm looking at the training
 
00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
aspect I think we should consider if
 
00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
it's going to be maybe a mandated
 
00:47:38.329 --> 00:47:38.339 align:start position:0%
four-hour block of training annually
 
00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
because once they have the initial
 
00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:41.220 align:start position:0%
training really it's more of a refresher
 
00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:43.140 align:start position:0%
course for the change of law that should
 
00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:45.260 align:start position:0%
probably be done at least annually yeah
 
00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
we need to prescribe the time amount
 
00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
that should be allocated to that or we
 
00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:51.180 align:start position:0%
should leave that up to them I think we
 
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
leave that up to the courts they I think
 
00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:54.300 align:start position:0%
that they know
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
they know at least as long as we mandate
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
we can use a descriptor substantial some
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
type of descriptor to say that this
 
00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:05.220 align:start position:0%
training has to be actually not just you
 
00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
know five minutes
 
00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:09.300 align:start position:0%
I think we can massage that language out
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
without putting an hour limit to it
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
um represent I'm
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
go ahead no I'm not interested yeah
 
00:48:21.309 --> 00:48:21.319 align:start position:0%
I would think that you might want to
 
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
Loop commissioner Quinn in from the
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety because he's the
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
one that signs off on the bottom line of
 
00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:30.740 align:start position:0%
all of the stuff doing with the
 
00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
NCIS the uh I'm already meeting with the
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
attorney general so he reports to him so
 
00:48:37.849 --> 00:48:37.859 align:start position:0%
but the thing is he's the one who's got
 
00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
to sign off on all of that stuff so he
 
00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:41.460 align:start position:0%
probably could answer the questions a
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
lot easier and quicker for you or send
 
00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
someone over that could so that you
 
00:48:47.809 --> 00:48:47.819 align:start position:0%
could ask the questions that you needed
 
00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
um back to the stand on Focus we agree
 
00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
on training did you have something I saw
 
00:48:58.130 --> 00:48:58.140 align:start position:0%
you raise your hand for a second then
 
00:48:59.809 --> 00:48:59.819 align:start position:0%
pull it back down when I took away the
 
00:49:02.329 --> 00:49:02.339 align:start position:0%
hours you put it back down yeah okay so
 
00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:03.900 align:start position:0%
we're going to mandate training but
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
we're not going to tell them how to do
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
it we're going to mandate that they have
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
initial training and that they have
 
00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:11.220 align:start position:0%
annual training or as the Law changes go
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
ahead represent I don't know I don't
 
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
know whether it's RSA or Court rule but
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
we do have an annual training or an
 
00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:20.700 align:start position:0%
annual refresher where we sit down and
 
00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
that typically is an hour maybe more uh
 
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
it's we have a rather free-flowing
 
00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
conversation uh with our district court
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
judge it's typically held in October and
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
many times I've sat there thinking
 
00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:35.460 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be nice if I were listening
 
00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
to other courts how come is our own is
 
00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
our wisdom confined only to this forum a
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
nice for that just
 
00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
I think what we heard though is that
 
00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
it's really um it's really
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
um depending on where you are what if
 
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
you get training what the training
 
00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:55.740 align:start position:0%
contains we heard someone who went to
 
00:49:57.290 --> 00:49:57.300 align:start position:0%
two different trainings within a week
 
00:49:59.569 --> 00:49:59.579 align:start position:0%
and they were different um so I think we
 
00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
needed it to be standardized across the
 
00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:05.060 align:start position:0%
state and it needs to be
 
00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
mandatory and so many to sign off that
 
00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
it occurred
 
00:50:11.809 --> 00:50:11.819 align:start position:0%
so I think that that we don't need to
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
get into the Weeds about what it
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
contains we just need to make sure that
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
it happens and somebody signs off that
 
00:50:19.809 --> 00:50:19.819 align:start position:0%
it happened
 
00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:23.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:26.329 --> 00:50:26.339 align:start position:0%
it doesn't sound like there is any kind
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
of certification process for this so
 
00:50:32.809 --> 00:50:32.819 align:start position:0%
it's one thing to provide training to
 
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
make training available and to even
 
00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
require people to take the training
 
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
um the other the other big issue is how
 
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
much of the training actually sinks in
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
um you know and that has to do with the
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensiveness and the effectiveness
 
00:50:50.569 --> 00:50:50.579 align:start position:0%
of of the training itself
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
so you know to me if there was if there
 
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
was one thing
 
00:50:58.450 --> 00:50:58.460 align:start position:0%
that we might want to also think about
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
it would be some sort of basic
 
00:51:05.089 --> 00:51:05.099 align:start position:0%
competency assessment or test that
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
somebody might take before they're just
 
00:51:08.329 --> 00:51:08.339 align:start position:0%
sort of thrown out there in this
 
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
situation for the first time and that
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
would be my primary worry because you
 
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
know if you if you do the math if we
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
have 85 Bill Commissioners now
 
00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
um sounds like we're down 35 from where
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
we were pre-covered so if if we do some
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
things that make it better and more
 
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
attractive for people to to be bail
 
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioners one of the things we could
 
00:51:31.609 --> 00:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
be dealing with you know in a perfect
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
world might be an influx of new
 
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
applicants uh so how do you do that how
 
00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
do you ensure that people you know who
 
00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:44.300 align:start position:0%
are new to the job can deliver a service
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
that is reasonably consistent with what
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
more experienced people might deliver
 
00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:54.180 align:start position:0%
and and I think that what I get a little
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
bit worried when I hear about uh four
 
00:51:58.490 --> 00:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
hours of training and then somebody's
 
00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
making bail decisions who's never done
 
00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
it before and and uh and and I think
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's kind of been where we are and
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
we've sort of found a way ways to make
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
it work but again you know if we're
 
00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:11.480 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
professionalizing this and uh I I think
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
one of the ways that people get
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
respected and they get treated like
 
00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:20.940 align:start position:0%
professionals is that they have
 
00:52:22.609 --> 00:52:22.619 align:start position:0%
consistent training and that there are
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
consistent standards across the board
 
00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
that professionalize the occupation
 
00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:29.750 align:start position:0%
that professionalize the occupation
so

00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:31.559 align:start position:0%
um having some type of an assessment
 
00:52:34.609 --> 00:52:34.619 align:start position:0%
would be a good idea I think I think too
 
00:52:38.329 --> 00:52:38.339 align:start position:0%
yeah we could um we could and how that
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
looks in the language I'm gonna hold off
 
00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
on until we speak to the courts but we
 
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
could require that they after their
 
00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
initial training that they ex display
 
00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
competency in the knowledge that they've
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
just received without making it um too
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
complicated or a big deal uh
 
00:52:56.809 --> 00:52:56.819 align:start position:0%
representative Stone
 
00:52:59.390 --> 00:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair isn't it my
 
00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:00.839 align:start position:0%
understanding and correctly if I'm wrong
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
but these individuals are appointed by
 
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
district court judge for where you serve
 
00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
or no it's done by AOC now
 
00:53:11.329 --> 00:53:11.339 align:start position:0%
it it used to be by your local uh your
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
District Court Judge it's now done by
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
the administer uh by the administration
 
00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
AOC judge of these uh of the Court
 
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
thank you it's done out of uh Granite
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
Street somewhere just follow up
 
00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
since these positions are volunteer
 
00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
positions uh and the courts obviously
 
00:53:31.549 --> 00:53:31.559 align:start position:0%
have a understanding of the individual's
 
00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
background I think that needs to be in
 
00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
consideration when we're looking at
 
00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
going too far to professionalize
 
00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
something that they are volunteers these
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
are basically a kind of a per diem rate
 
00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's relatively low and what you're
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
demanding them I think we have to really
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
balance that out and not
 
00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
overdo it with regulation at the same
 
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:51.230 align:start position:0%
overdo it with regulation at the same
time

00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
I agree but I I also representative Muse
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
that they should at least be able to
 
00:53:58.490 --> 00:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
display a competency before they hit the
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
streets so to say and how what that
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
looks like I'll leave to the courts to
 
00:54:04.609 --> 00:54:04.619 align:start position:0%
decide that way we're not going too too
 
00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:06.020 align:start position:0%
far as far as
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
micromanaging a relationship between the
 
00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:10.740 align:start position:0%
contractor and the subcontractor go
 
00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
ahead represent Muse
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
and and I think one of the things we
 
00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:15.780 align:start position:0%
shouldn't forget too is that although
 
00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
these folks are volunteers the decisions
 
00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
that they make
 
00:54:23.809 --> 00:54:23.819 align:start position:0%
um impact the freedom of of individuals
 
00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:25.740 align:start position:0%
in the justice system they're very very
 
00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
important decisions
 
00:54:30.589 --> 00:54:30.599 align:start position:0%
uh agreed and when we're talking about
 
00:54:32.329 --> 00:54:32.339 align:start position:0%
the you know a decision about whether
 
00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:35.220 align:start position:0%
someone stays or goes could have
 
00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
implications into their job their family
 
00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:38.170 align:start position:0%
implications into their job their family
life

00:54:38.170 --> 00:54:38.180 align:start position:0%
life
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
a huge huge ramifications so um I I see
 
00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with making sure that the
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
initial appointees can display a level
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
of Competency and knowledge of the law
 
00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
in what that looks like would leave to
 
00:54:54.829 --> 00:54:54.839 align:start position:0%
the courts to decide so
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt
 
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
I was a commissioner of safety for fire
 
00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
standard and training for income he is
 
00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:03.780 align:start position:0%
we always wrestle with the idea of how
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
much training uh is beneficial how much
 
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
training stops the volunteers from
 
00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
coming in and across the state in New
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have some of the highest
 
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
training level hours of any other state
 
00:55:17.089 --> 00:55:17.099 align:start position:0%
and because of that volunteerism is
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
dropping off because it's hovering
 
00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
around 200 hours
 
00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
to become a firefighter and so a lot of
 
00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
firefighters just say I don't have 200
 
00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:29.109 align:start position:0%
firefighters just say I don't have 200
hours

00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:30.780 align:start position:0%
how much
 
00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
you ask of a person that's getting forty
 
00:55:35.329 --> 00:55:35.339 align:start position:0%
dollars every other time they go out I I
 
00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:37.140 align:start position:0%
agree and thank you that that that
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
knowledge is is valuable
 
00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
um and the firefighters all likewise are
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
Vol these are volunteer firefighters and
 
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
they're not getting paid for that
 
00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:48.780 align:start position:0%
training either are they yeah so we we
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
have to be cognizant of that to uh
 
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
mandating you know many hours of
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
training for someone who's not getting
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
paid is
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
is indeed almost a punishment so again I
 
00:56:02.089 --> 00:56:02.099 align:start position:0%
go back to let's leave the court what
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
they think
 
00:56:05.809 --> 00:56:05.819 align:start position:0%
much training they need we just want to
 
00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
mandate that they have it that it's
 
00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
uniform and that before they take the
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
the role they have a basic understanding
 
00:56:14.569 --> 00:56:14.579 align:start position:0%
of the role representative side Tech uh
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative Muse stole by the Thunder
 
00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:19.740 align:start position:0%
that no matter what the training is or
 
00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
however they are making real decisions
 
00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
concerning people's Liberty yes you
 
00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:29.300 align:start position:0%
can't underestimate that agreed where I
 
00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:32.460 align:start position:0%
it's there has to be it's part of this
 
00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:33.770 align:start position:0%
it's there has to be it's part of this
training

00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:56:35.809 --> 00:56:35.819 align:start position:0%
the laboratory what I'm calling the
 
00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:38.700 align:start position:0%
laboratory like a field training officer
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
you go out and you actually see this
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
being done there's just something about
 
00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:45.900 align:start position:0%
getting your hands into the dirt and
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
seeing this the process at work
 
00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
it's more than ethereal it's it you're
 
00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
dealing with real people in a real
 
00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
situation just to feel you get for that
 
00:56:59.150 --> 00:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
and you can't get in a classroom it's
 
00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:01.740 align:start position:0%
got to be part of any training is that
 
00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
agreed and we can take
 
00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
um police field training officers they
 
00:57:08.809 --> 00:57:08.819 align:start position:0%
have to do
 
00:57:11.329 --> 00:57:11.339 align:start position:0%
um tandem most departments now you don't
 
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
just hit the street
 
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
um and I think the same should go that
 
00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
there should be a period of shadowing
 
00:57:21.049 --> 00:57:21.059 align:start position:0%
um however again back to its volunteer
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
and there unless that uh you're going to
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
split your forty dollars with your uh
 
00:57:29.329 --> 00:57:29.339 align:start position:0%
with your ride-along partner but we can
 
00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
um again I really hesitate to
 
00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:33.300 align:start position:0%
micromanage with the court how they do
 
00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
it so we can make strong suggestions
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:40.319 --> 00:57:45.170 align:start position:0%
 
ah

00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.329 --> 00:57:47.339 align:start position:0%
I wasn't committed not saying anything
 
00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
today but as a law professor I just
 
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
can't resist
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:58.250 --> 00:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
I think this committee has got to decide
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
whether they're going to treat bail
 
00:58:02.930 --> 00:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
Commissioners like volunteers
 
00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:06.020 align:start position:0%
or like paid
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
contractors you know if somebody's
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
getting 50 bucks and 50 bucks for uh
 
00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:14.220 align:start position:0%
being a bail commissioner in a
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
particular case they're no longer
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
volunteers so I just caution the
 
00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.370 align:start position:0%
volunteers so I just caution the
committee

00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
between treating you know using the term
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
volunteer and also being aggressive
 
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
which I completely agree with about
 
00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:28.380 align:start position:0%
these people getting paid the money
 
00:58:30.829 --> 00:58:30.839 align:start position:0%
they're due but if they're getting paid
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
that money they're not don't use the
 
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
word volunteers it it'll just confuse
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
the conversation with the court system I
 
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
just have language thing
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
um second you know
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
in thinking about training and thinking
 
00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:46.809 align:start position:0%
in thinking about training and thinking
about

00:58:46.809 --> 00:58:46.819 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:49.640 align:start position:0%
the shall we call it
 
00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
decentralized organization of bail
 
00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:55.140 align:start position:0%
Commissioners in the state you know one
 
00:58:57.410 --> 00:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
of the recommendations that might be
 
00:58:59.809 --> 00:58:59.819 align:start position:0%
worth talking to the court about and
 
00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:02.940 align:start position:0%
being in legislation is to fund a
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
part-time position in the court system
 
00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
for managing bail commissioners
 
00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:11.630 align:start position:0%
for managing bail commissioners
um

00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:14.109 --> 00:59:14.119 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
is the best model for pulling together
 
00:59:21.289 --> 00:59:21.299 align:start position:0%
all the different stuff the all the
 
00:59:23.329 --> 00:59:23.339 align:start position:0%
different and good stuff that everyone's
 
00:59:25.490 --> 00:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
been talking about today and yesterday I
 
00:59:29.089 --> 00:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
think I think and and I think uh
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
uh you know when the conversation occurs
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
with the court about bail Commissioners
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
you know they're going to say money
 
00:59:35.089 --> 00:59:35.099 align:start position:0%
money money money you know who's going
 
00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:36.900 align:start position:0%
to do yeah oh oh now we're going to add
 
00:59:40.609 --> 00:59:40.619 align:start position:0%
some more uh uh tasks to people who
 
00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:42.900 align:start position:0%
already have too many jobs
 
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's a legitimate
 
00:59:46.849 --> 00:59:46.859 align:start position:0%
concern on the course part but you know
 
00:59:49.450 --> 00:59:49.460 align:start position:0%
I think if if you bring this together
 
00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:52.980 align:start position:0%
and think about giving the court a
 
00:59:55.309 --> 00:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
part-time I think it's only needed for
 
00:59:59.329 --> 00:59:59.339 align:start position:0%
part-time a part-time position
 
00:59:59.339 --> 01:00:01.430 align:start position:0%
part-time a part-time position
uh

01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner coordinator let's call
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
it I think that is a model that the
 
01:00:07.849 --> 01:00:07.859 align:start position:0%
court might well be very receptive to
 
01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:11.660 align:start position:0%
and uh not make this a
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
conversation where
 
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh one party is saying you know you
 
01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
courts you're falling down on your task
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
as to bail Commissioners and the courts
 
01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
saying I I we don't have the money to do
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
all the things you want us to do I think
 
01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:29.460 align:start position:0%
that could be a a a quickly spiral into
 
01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:31.980 align:start position:0%
a negative conversation but if you you
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
know if you talk about you know we
 
01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:34.740 align:start position:0%
really want to improve Bill
 
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
Commissioners here's our thought what do
 
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
you think of this that might be a better
 
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
approach and I think that that was the
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
approach I intended to take but I really
 
01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
I like that idea
 
01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
um that there does need to be somebody
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
who is um who's has eyes on on this
 
01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
whole thing because it is balkanized and
 
01:00:54.839 --> 01:00:55.910 align:start position:0%
whole thing because it is balkanized and
um

01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
from one District to the next I mean
 
01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's hard for I want to be able to call
 
01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:00.839 align:start position:0%
a court and see how many Bill
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are there and someone to
 
01:01:04.849 --> 01:01:04.859 align:start position:0%
say this many as of today and how many
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
Bales were done last year this many as
 
01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:09.660 align:start position:0%
of right now that should be in to your
 
01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:13.140 align:start position:0%
point I think a coordinator who can look
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
up and maintain and the way I would put
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
it you know and talking to people in
 
01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.370 align:start position:0%
it you know and talking to people in
business

01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:20.390 align:start position:0%
business
um

01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
when they assign projects to people in
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
their business what they were looking
 
01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:29.220 align:start position:0%
for a phrase I've heard repeatedly is I
 
01:01:30.829 --> 01:01:30.839 align:start position:0%
want somebody who wakes up in the
 
01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
morning thinking about bail
 
01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
Commissioners yeah and we don't have
 
01:01:35.569 --> 01:01:35.579 align:start position:0%
that and that would be really helpful
 
01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Professor does the does the
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
committee agree with that idea that we
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
should propose to the courts and if they
 
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:42.950 align:start position:0%
should propose to the courts and if they
agree

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
agree
 
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
um try to fund a part-time position to
 
01:01:47.089 --> 01:01:47.099 align:start position:0%
be the bail commissioner coordinator
 
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to call it's their
 
01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
their job representative Newman
 
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
but I I intended to listen more than
 
01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:55.390 align:start position:0%
but I I intended to listen more than
talk

01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:55.400 align:start position:0%
talk
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
did some training
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
in the FAA and you have people that
 
01:02:02.109 --> 01:02:02.119 align:start position:0%
train and check
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
controllers and pilots and stuff like
 
01:02:04.559 --> 01:02:05.390 align:start position:0%
controllers and pilots and stuff like
that

01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
and I think that the really important
 
01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
part of that is if you do have one
 
01:02:10.849 --> 01:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
individual like you're going to talk
 
01:02:13.549 --> 01:02:13.559 align:start position:0%
about that they go and they do check
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
rides on on
 
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
kind of like check rides on on bail
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and then you would have
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
somebody that not only knew what was
 
01:02:23.809 --> 01:02:23.819 align:start position:0%
going on with the bail Commissioners
 
01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:25.740 align:start position:0%
they would also have an understanding of
 
01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
what was going on with the various
 
01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
courts and how
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
consistent the training is across the
 
01:02:36.049 --> 01:02:36.059 align:start position:0%
whole training program I'll bring that
 
01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.809 --> 01:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman I
 
01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
think one of the things we have to be
 
01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:44.839 align:start position:0%
very careful is one
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
is the system broken
 
01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
or does the system need to be
 
01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
kind of patch back together I think it's
 
01:02:54.890 --> 01:02:54.900 align:start position:0%
a little bit of both and what we're
 
01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
hearing is training training training
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
and the professor does bring up a good
 
01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
point the more we go down this path of
 
01:03:05.809 --> 01:03:05.819 align:start position:0%
creating a position in the court
 
01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
creating a revenue source to make sure
 
01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
they get paid we are now we are now
 
01:03:14.109 --> 01:03:14.119 align:start position:0%
opening up another branch of employees
 
01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be a very very
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
slippery slope so if we do create
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
something in the court system that says
 
01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
all these people are going to be in
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
charge of the bill commissioners
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
we don't have anything like that to
 
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
start so who who Who's going to save
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
what this job is going to be who's going
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
to be the one to actually create the job
 
01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
on the court system as a human resources
 
01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
department and I believe that they would
 
01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:39.660 align:start position:0%
probably have to write a job description
 
01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
and then they would have to send it out
 
01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:43.740 align:start position:0%
to get a salary analysis there's a whole
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
huge process we that's why we we stay
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
away from the micromanagement I'm going
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
to suggest this and I said I would I
 
01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
would Hazard a guess that the court
 
01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:56.460 align:start position:0%
system as long as we're willing to pay
 
01:03:58.609 --> 01:03:58.619 align:start position:0%
for it would be happy to have it
 
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
um so let's let's see what they say
 
01:04:02.329 --> 01:04:02.339 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you Mr
 
01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
chairman how about it would that fall
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
under somebody's job description that's
 
01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:08.220 align:start position:0%
already working in the court system
 
01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't sound like a very
 
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
time consuming thing to keep track of
 
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
that data it's my understanding that the
 
01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
the courts right now
 
01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
are understaffed and um and I don't
 
01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
believe that that's any form of an
 
01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
exaggeration and based on our visit
 
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
there as you can see they it's it's a
 
01:04:29.569 --> 01:04:29.579 align:start position:0%
very busy busy business and they they
 
01:04:31.609 --> 01:04:31.619 align:start position:0%
are not at their Staffing levels as it
 
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
is so if we were to tell them find some
 
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
time for someone
 
01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
they're going to say sure but it's going
 
01:04:37.609 --> 01:04:37.619 align:start position:0%
to take away from this and it's just
 
01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
going to representative Pratt it's still
 
01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
a possibility that we're looking at uh
 
01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
making the courts work six days a week
 
01:04:45.289 --> 01:04:45.299 align:start position:0%
because that's a very expensive one we
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
talked about before
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
um it's a very real possibility that
 
01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
we're going to discuss um having at
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
least one judge on the weekends to
 
01:04:55.970 --> 01:04:55.980 align:start position:0%
handle these and we already know there's
 
01:04:59.210 --> 01:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
one doing emergency orders so we're
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
going to have that conversation and I I
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
think for that for any of this and I
 
01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:04.619 align:start position:0%
don't want to get too far down this road
 
01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be another day but
 
01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:07.609 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be another day but
yeah

01:05:07.609 --> 01:05:07.619 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
if we're going to mandate a list of
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
crimes that cannot be bailed by a bail
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner then we cannot do that
 
01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
without having somebody alternatively be
 
01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:20.359 align:start position:0%
able to hear within 24 hours
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
a judge to be able to hear it so I think
 
01:05:25.609 --> 01:05:25.619 align:start position:0%
the two things are inextricably linked
 
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
and as we know our friends in the Senate
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
have kind of drawn that line and we won
 
01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
at least these crimes so I suggest that
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
we say okay you can have the crimes but
 
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
you have to be able to have somebody
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
there to hear these people so they at
 
01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
least have an opportunity to get out
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
because again go back to Presumed
 
01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
Innocent one more follow ahead yeah sure
 
01:05:46.849 --> 01:05:46.859 align:start position:0%
um maybe that would be the person that
 
01:05:47.809 --> 01:05:47.819 align:start position:0%
would be able to see in the bail
 
01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
commissions or that
 
01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
possible night court or whatever it is
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
yeah possibly but I'll we'll discuss
 
01:05:56.329 --> 01:05:56.339 align:start position:0%
that like I said they they have a they
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
have a human resources department they
 
01:05:59.930 --> 01:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
they they're going to want to put their
 
01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:00.829 align:start position:0%
they they're going to want to put their
their

01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:00.839 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:06:02.569 --> 01:06:02.579 align:start position:0%
um their own process in place to try and
 
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
figure out their time management I'm
 
01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:05.700 align:start position:0%
just willing to say are we willing to
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
are we willing to fund a part-time
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
position and let them figure out how to
 
01:06:11.690 --> 01:06:11.700 align:start position:0%
how to deal with it so
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
um I just want to be able when I go to
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
the core station the subcommittee thinks
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
that we would be able to vote to support
 
01:06:19.569 --> 01:06:19.579 align:start position:0%
such a thing if you are open to it
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
representative Stone thank you
 
01:06:24.349 --> 01:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
so it's my understanding that they don't
 
01:06:26.270 --> 01:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
have someone currently that oversees any
 
01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
of the bail operations or Commissioners
 
01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
or someone who is at least charged with
 
01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
that responsibility within AOC
 
01:06:34.809 --> 01:06:34.819 align:start position:0%
I think probably very Loosely um
 
01:06:37.849 --> 01:06:37.859 align:start position:0%
Professor share
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
the responsibility
 
01:06:40.319 --> 01:06:41.690 align:start position:0%
the responsibility
for

01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
the primary responsibility for bail
 
01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
Commissioners is with the administrative
 
01:06:48.770 --> 01:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
judge for the district court system
 
01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:51.670 align:start position:0%
judge for the district court system
um

01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:56.770 --> 01:06:56.780 align:start position:0%
that judge has a tremendous amount of
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
responsibilities on their plate
 
01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
and uh to representative Reed's
 
01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
discussion you know the very problem
 
01:07:09.049 --> 01:07:09.059 align:start position:0%
with bail Commissioners in part has been
 
01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
there's nobody who wakes up in the
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
morning thinking about bail
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
commissioners it's probably not a
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
full-time job but to organize consistent
 
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
repeated training to develop a shadowing
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
program to recruit bail Commissioners
 
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
you know I I think that's a substantial
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
job and you know I've known the last
 
01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
three consecutive
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
administrative judges and boy
 
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
they just don't have the time
 
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
to do this in the way it needs to be
 
01:07:50.930 --> 01:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
done for uh what else is on their plate
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
that that judge just give us the gives
 
01:07:54.109 --> 01:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
the committee a feeling for what else
 
01:07:56.450 --> 01:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
that administrative judge has to oversee
 
01:08:00.049 --> 01:08:00.059 align:start position:0%
they've got 32 or 33 Circuit Court
 
01:08:00.059 --> 01:08:01.450 align:start position:0%
they've got 32 or 33 Circuit Court
judges

01:08:01.450 --> 01:08:01.460 align:start position:0%
judges
 
01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
who on a daily basis create messes
 
01:08:09.289 --> 01:08:09.299 align:start position:0%
and run into problems you know they're
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
it to be uh
 
01:08:13.849 --> 01:08:13.859 align:start position:0%
I have tenure into law school so I can
 
01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
say this but they
 
01:08:18.249 --> 01:08:18.259 align:start position:0%
you know they're like
 
01:08:23.329 --> 01:08:23.339 align:start position:0%
uh 33 teenage cats that the
 
01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:25.980 align:start position:0%
administrative judge is hurting
 
01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:28.140 align:start position:0%
um they're just they do stuff that that
 
01:08:30.349 --> 01:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
they can't do they need to be told to
 
01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
back off they have to manage uh the
 
01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:34.980 align:start position:0%
administrative judge has to manage the
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
relationships between those judges and
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
the Clerks of Court
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
and negotiate those relationships with
 
01:08:43.849 --> 01:08:43.859 align:start position:0%
the administrative office of the Court
 
01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
which is in charge of the Clerks of
 
01:08:46.199 --> 01:08:47.349 align:start position:0%
which is in charge of the Clerks of
Court

01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
Court
 
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
they need to right now they need to
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
unwind the felonies first program and
 
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
get ready to have probable cause
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
hearings once again held in District
 
01:09:02.209 --> 01:09:02.219 align:start position:0%
Court which is a a huge administrative
 
01:09:02.219 --> 01:09:03.950 align:start position:0%
Court which is a a huge administrative
burden

01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
burden
 
01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:06.900 align:start position:0%
um uh and that's just you know
 
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
and they have to do the the budget work
 
01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
uh this is a
 
01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
it's important to bail Commissioners
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
it's important to the system but bail
 
01:09:23.169 --> 01:09:23.179 align:start position:0%
Commissioners as a relative matter or
 
01:09:26.809 --> 01:09:26.819 align:start position:0%
a blip on their radar in terms of having
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
time to focus on it
 
01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:30.900 align:start position:0%
so to your point they're not waking up
 
01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
in the morning thinking about bail
 
01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
Commissioners unless something bad
 
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
happened overnight something really bad
 
01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
you know I don't I'm not sure they ever
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
wake up any morning during the year
 
01:09:42.289 --> 01:09:42.299 align:start position:0%
thinking about bail Commissioners
 
01:09:42.299 --> 01:09:45.590 align:start position:0%
thinking about bail Commissioners
um

01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um and I I think
 
01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
there should be somebody at the court
 
01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:52.739 align:start position:0%
who does wake up and and a good point
 
01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
was just raised recruiting Bill
 
01:09:56.570 --> 01:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
Commissioners so I'm keeping track of
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
how many when they're leaving right now
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
it sounds like nobody is and so you
 
01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
could have a wave disappear and no one
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
would even know it until the police
 
01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
started calling saying no one's
 
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
answering our calls to bail people so um
 
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a very important topic
 
01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:14.460 align:start position:0%
to bring up with the court and I think
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
that with the support of the committee
 
01:10:17.650 --> 01:10:17.660 align:start position:0%
we can discuss
 
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
funding and we will discuss that as well
 
01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
with Finance
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
okay so we have training we have 50
 
01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.729 align:start position:0%
okay so we have training we have 50
funding

01:10:28.729 --> 01:10:28.739 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
um we have the possibility of funding a
 
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
position to oversee and manage the bail
 
01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
commissioner system
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
anything else what else am I missing I'm
 
01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
sure I'm missing something
 
01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:46.010 align:start position:0%
sure I'm missing something
representative

01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:48.050 --> 01:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
paid we're not going to dabble in
 
01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
mileage because we're going to up the
 
01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:50.990 align:start position:0%
mileage because we're going to up the
rate

01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
rate
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
yeah indeed there is I don't think we
 
01:10:54.169 --> 01:10:54.179 align:start position:0%
need to add any more we talked about
 
01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
swearing swearing in right yep we're
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
going to look into that we're gonna
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
training consistency I think we're those
 
01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
are all my friends
 
01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:11.209 align:start position:0%
are all my friends
okay

01:11:11.209 --> 01:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
so I think we can wrap up that portion
 
01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:15.110 align:start position:0%
so I think we can wrap up that portion
of

01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:11:17.689 --> 01:11:17.699 align:start position:0%
this discussion a lot of it is
 
01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
contingent upon
 
01:11:21.890 --> 01:11:21.900 align:start position:0%
the reception we received from the
 
01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:23.390 align:start position:0%
the reception we received from the
courts

01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
courts
 
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to mandate the courts do
 
01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
things to a certain limit but only to
 
01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
the Limit that they can do them and we
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
don't know that until we talk to them
 
01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
representative did you
 
01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:36.780 align:start position:0%
yeah one of the one of the things we may
 
01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
want to do because I know our a lot of
 
01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
our conversations have been pretty
 
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
pretty wide-ranging
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
one thing I'm I'm a little bit concerned
 
01:11:49.610 --> 01:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
about is if we
 
01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:51.050 align:start position:0%
about is if we
if we're

01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
if we're
 
01:11:53.330 --> 01:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
if we're too ambitious with whatever
 
01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
legislation that we decide to put
 
01:11:55.679 --> 01:11:57.169 align:start position:0%
legislation that we decide to put
forward

01:11:57.169 --> 01:11:57.179 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:11:57.179 --> 01:11:59.270 align:start position:0%
forward
uh

01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
you know will we be able to get it
 
01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
passed will the folks in the other body
 
01:12:04.610 --> 01:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
agree to it
 
01:12:07.130 --> 01:12:07.140 align:start position:0%
um so I mean one of the things one of
 
01:12:09.169 --> 01:12:09.179 align:start position:0%
the things to think think about doing
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
too is to
 
01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
um and maybe we can
 
01:12:16.970 --> 01:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
you know we can kind of think about this
 
01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
but at some point when we're done with
 
01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
this have some sort of uh prioritization
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
around what what really needs you know
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
what what's essential to have going
 
01:12:31.010 --> 01:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
forward and and then I think it's it's
 
01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
fine to say and we and we also recommend
 
01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
you know action on these things and some
 
01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
of these things
 
01:12:40.010 --> 01:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
the court May well may be able to do
 
01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:41.630 align:start position:0%
the court May well may be able to do
administratively

01:12:41.630 --> 01:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
administratively
 
01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
um especially if we connect them to
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
systemic issues that are causing
 
01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
problems in other areas because a lot of
 
01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
these things that we've identified just
 
01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
sort of tend to metastasize in other
 
01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:54.770 align:start position:0%
sort of tend to metastasize in other
places

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
places
 
01:12:57.050 --> 01:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
I'm a little hesitant on that because we
 
01:12:58.490 --> 01:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
do have a statute that the bail
 
01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
Commissioners received training and that
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to have seemed to have
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
taken quite so I think we do need to we
 
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
need to Define that but my intention was
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
we have I believe four or five bills
 
01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
that we've retained and I think that
 
01:13:15.490 --> 01:13:15.500 align:start position:0%
what we do is we prioritize and we we
 
01:13:17.209 --> 01:13:17.219 align:start position:0%
compartmentalize this into those
 
01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
different bills so that you know we've
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
got our main belt that has the things
 
01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
that just have to be fixed and then we
 
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
have the things that you know we still
 
01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
think are really important but if they
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
get pushed to the Wayside the system
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
still goes on and survives and it's
 
01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
we've fixed at least
 
01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
the minimum of what we could but I feel
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
like at this this point in history this
 
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
body has dealt with this so many times
 
01:13:46.669 --> 01:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
that it's now time to take a real
 
01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
um a real bite at just fixing it and
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
stop trying to whittle around the edges
 
01:13:53.090 --> 01:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
because it'll just be back in you and
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
I'll be here again next next year
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully and doing it again and so
 
01:13:59.689 --> 01:13:59.699 align:start position:0%
let's just move on if we can and
 
01:14:02.090 --> 01:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
hopefully get this all
 
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
in a in a global fix
 
01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm aware of the danger of being too
 
01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
ambitious I have spoken to our
 
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
counterparts some of them on the uh in
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
the other chamber in their concern Still
 
01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
Remains these list of crimes so I feel
 
01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
like as long as we get that in there
 
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
everything else should be okay as long
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
as we can come up with the money so
 
01:14:25.729 --> 01:14:25.739 align:start position:0%
let's shoot high aim for the stars and
 
01:14:27.709 --> 01:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
see where we end up I don't think
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
anyone's willing to let the thing just
 
01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
go away based on you know that so again
 
01:14:36.050 --> 01:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
we still have hurdles we still have to
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
get the courts to agree so barring that
 
01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
represent Pratt uh we talked the other
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
day about bail and I know it used to be
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh for a more serious crime you actually
 
01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh paid more money for the bail and it
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
sounded like that went away
 
01:14:59.090 --> 01:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
I don't understand how all that is yeah
 
01:14:59.100 --> 01:14:59.930 align:start position:0%
I don't understand how all that is yeah
um

01:14:59.930 --> 01:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
so it's my understanding that because I
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't part of that in 2018.
 
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
a large contingent of the people who are
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
who are arrested and make up the
 
01:15:14.689 --> 01:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
majority of this have no money they just
 
01:15:17.149 --> 01:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
don't so you know you could set
 
01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollar bill you could set a
 
01:15:20.570 --> 01:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar bill they're not going to
 
01:15:22.610 --> 01:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
have it so what happens is they end up
 
01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
being staying incarcerated just based on
 
01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
the mere fact that they're poor and
 
01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
that's not what the justice system was
 
01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
designed to do bail cash Bill still
 
01:15:33.169 --> 01:15:33.179 align:start position:0%
exists and can be used
 
01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
um in egregious cases and where someone
 
01:15:37.490 --> 01:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
actually has money so if you have a
 
01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
corporation somebody uh you know gets
 
01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
involved in a big white collar crime
 
01:15:43.070 --> 01:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
thing you can set a million dollars bail
 
01:15:45.890 --> 01:15:45.900 align:start position:0%
and that that would hurt them to lose it
 
01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
so that would ensure that they come but
 
01:15:50.030 --> 01:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
if you set a bail of a thousand dollars
 
01:15:51.890 --> 01:15:51.900 align:start position:0%
to a homeless person you've just been
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
caution you might as well just said hold
 
01:15:56.450 --> 01:15:56.460 align:start position:0%
them well just to play Devil's attitude
 
01:15:58.250 --> 01:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
on that oh absolutely a person that has
 
01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
nothing is more likely probably to flee
 
01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
the state if they were looking at time
 
01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:06.659 align:start position:0%
I agree and that's still that's still
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
available to hold flight risks they just
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
have to show why they would be a Flight
 
01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.570 align:start position:0%
have to show why they would be a Flight
Risk

01:16:11.570 --> 01:16:11.580 align:start position:0%
Risk
 
01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
um and someone without a car can't fly
 
01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
too far right
 
01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:17.460 align:start position:0%
um that's that's that's actually one of
 
01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
the things we're going to discuss next
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
week is the second part we've talked
 
01:16:23.810 --> 01:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
about the dangerousness we're going to
 
01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
touch on Flight Risk because those are
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
the two key aspects of why we have bail
 
01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:29.460 align:start position:0%
one are they a danger the public if they
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
let out two are they a risk of flight
 
01:16:33.229 --> 01:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
and we haven't even talked about flight
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
so that we're going to talk about that
 
01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:44.570 --> 01:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
let's see what I'm just we're going to
 
01:16:47.090 --> 01:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
take uh we're gonna take 15 minutes
 
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
and we're going to come back and if
 
01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
there's anything else we can touch on
 
01:43:41.810 --> 01:43:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
calling the meeting back to order
 
01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:45.109 align:start position:0%
calling the meeting back to order
um

01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:46.970 --> 01:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:43:49.010 --> 01:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
we we've talked about a great bit today
 
01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
I think we've made some good progress as
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
far as our as far as our structure of
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
what we're going to discuss with the
 
01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:56.870 align:start position:0%
what we're going to discuss with the
courts

01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
courts
 
01:43:58.729 --> 01:43:58.739 align:start position:0%
um I've just been informed that it's
 
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
likely that we'll have a meeting with
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
the Chief Justice sometime the first
 
01:44:04.609 --> 01:44:04.619 align:start position:0%
week of October myself and represent
 
01:44:07.129 --> 01:44:07.139 align:start position:0%
gather right and um
 
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
probably represent Rhodes and another
 
01:44:10.490 --> 01:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
representative that representative
 
01:44:12.290 --> 01:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
gathright chooses representative Muse is
 
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
going to be gone unfortunately but we'll
 
01:44:16.370 --> 01:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
sort out the logistics of that but it
 
01:44:17.930 --> 01:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
looks like it's going to be the first
 
01:44:20.689 --> 01:44:20.699 align:start position:0%
week in October
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
um one thing I want to address for us to
 
01:44:24.410 --> 01:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
think about
 
01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
um this is back to homework again if if
 
01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
you've looked online like we were
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
talking about yesterday to see all these
 
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
forms they have to put out
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
um the bill commissioner where he went
 
01:44:38.090 --> 01:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
he gave me a copy of all of them that
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask to be copied and put in
 
01:44:41.450 --> 01:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
everybody's box next week so you'll have
 
01:44:43.729 --> 01:44:43.739 align:start position:0%
it when you come back one thing I wanted
 
01:44:46.129 --> 01:44:46.139 align:start position:0%
to address though before we leave for
 
01:44:47.570 --> 01:44:47.580 align:start position:0%
the day and I'd like everyone to think
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
about over the next week
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
is that we've talked a lot about these
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
crimes and we've talked about you know
 
01:44:55.609 --> 01:44:55.619 align:start position:0%
the Felon and and the seriousness of
 
01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
these crimes but what we haven't
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
addressed I think and and we need to at
 
01:45:02.209 --> 01:45:02.219 align:start position:0%
least think about the majority of the
 
01:45:04.609 --> 01:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
problems for example the city of
 
01:45:06.770 --> 01:45:06.780 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Nashua are having
 
01:45:09.169 --> 01:45:09.179 align:start position:0%
aren't these crimes they're nuisance
 
01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
type crimes they're picking up people
 
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
for trespass for a disorderly person
 
01:45:16.850 --> 01:45:16.860 align:start position:0%
um and and they're bailing them out on
 
01:45:18.290 --> 01:45:18.300 align:start position:0%
personal cognizance and they're picking
 
01:45:20.169 --> 01:45:20.179 align:start position:0%
them up a few hours later the next day
 
01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
and it's happening you know three and
 
01:45:24.169 --> 01:45:24.179 align:start position:0%
four times sometimes over a weekend with
 
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
the same person I'd like everyone on the
 
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
committee to think about you know how
 
01:45:31.370 --> 01:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
how we could tackle that issue keeping
 
01:45:34.490 --> 01:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
in mind the the principle that we don't
 
01:45:36.050 --> 01:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
want to hold people because they're poor
 
01:45:37.370 --> 01:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
or mentally ill
 
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
but also taking that that burden off the
 
01:45:44.590 --> 01:45:44.600 align:start position:0%
local communities of same people
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
committing the same nuisance crime over
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
and over over a short period of time
 
01:45:52.609 --> 01:45:52.619 align:start position:0%
um perhaps look at it through the lens
 
01:45:55.490 --> 01:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
of okay you get picked up the second
 
01:45:58.609 --> 01:45:58.619 align:start position:0%
time that weekend perhaps we need to
 
01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
look at directing
 
01:46:03.410 --> 01:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
not necessarily be held in jail but
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
maybe an evaluation to see what's going
 
01:46:07.090 --> 01:46:07.100 align:start position:0%
on with them
 
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
something's happening be it mental
 
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
health be it substance
 
01:46:14.510 --> 01:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
let's look at how we can direct those
 
01:46:16.129 --> 01:46:16.139 align:start position:0%
people to get the services they need
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
rather than just put them into jail for
 
01:46:19.310 --> 01:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
the weekend
 
01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:20.750 align:start position:0%
the weekend
um

01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
that way we're helping both the
 
01:46:24.350 --> 01:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
community and the individual who's
 
01:46:26.090 --> 01:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
having these obvious issues that they
 
01:46:28.430 --> 01:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
have to keep you getting picked up any
 
01:46:32.090 --> 01:46:32.100 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that representative
 
01:46:33.530 --> 01:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
you know from from a homework
 
01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
perspective one of the things that's
 
01:46:39.490 --> 01:46:39.500 align:start position:0%
always interesting as a legislator is
 
01:46:41.810 --> 01:46:41.820 align:start position:0%
typically for almost any issue that you
 
01:46:43.609 --> 01:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
want to consider at some point or
 
01:46:45.770 --> 01:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
another there's been a commission or a
 
01:46:47.450 --> 01:46:47.460 align:start position:0%
committee that's been appointed to study
 
01:46:50.330 --> 01:46:50.340 align:start position:0%
the issue so back in 2022 the governor
 
01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
appointed an advisory Commission on
 
01:46:55.750 --> 01:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
mental illness in the corrections system
 
01:46:57.590 --> 01:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
and their full report and
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
recommendations are available and I have
 
01:47:02.750 --> 01:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
those and they address a lot of the
 
01:47:04.370 --> 01:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
things that I think we've heard
 
01:47:08.090 --> 01:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
consistently about in testimony some of
 
01:47:11.629 --> 01:47:11.639 align:start position:0%
the systemic issues so it's it's a
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
homeless person who might be arrested
 
01:47:16.490 --> 01:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
for shoplifting at Market Basket who is
 
01:47:20.050 --> 01:47:20.060 align:start position:0%
out on PR bail and then an hour later
 
01:47:22.729 --> 01:47:22.739 align:start position:0%
the same officer is rearresting them
 
01:47:24.770 --> 01:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
again at Market Basket for shoplifting
 
01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
so there are people
 
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
who commit small offenses over and over
 
01:47:33.729 --> 01:47:33.739 align:start position:0%
and over again um and
 
01:47:36.050 --> 01:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
there are substantial number of people
 
01:47:39.050 --> 01:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
like that in in our County jails so the
 
01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
issue is is how do we sort of get out of
 
01:47:44.570 --> 01:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
this cycle where the criminal justice
 
01:47:46.370 --> 01:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
system for better or worse seems to be
 
01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
warehousing people who have deeper
 
01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:49.970 align:start position:0%
warehousing people who have deeper
problems

01:47:49.970 --> 01:47:49.980 align:start position:0%
problems
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
um so this commission has actually uh
 
01:47:56.030 --> 01:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
dealt into kind of dove into that a bit
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
they do have recommendations so what
 
01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
I'll do is I'll send their final report
 
01:48:03.709 --> 01:48:03.719 align:start position:0%
to uh the members of the committee
 
01:48:06.169 --> 01:48:06.179 align:start position:0%
agreed that that is a very excellent
 
01:48:09.709 --> 01:48:09.719 align:start position:0%
idea so take a look at that and then put
 
01:48:11.149 --> 01:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
your own thoughts towards what you see
 
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
in that report and what you think about
 
01:48:15.229 --> 01:48:15.239 align:start position:0%
the issue I encourage also the members
 
01:48:18.169 --> 01:48:18.179 align:start position:0%
of the the subcommittee to um to reach
 
01:48:20.510 --> 01:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
out to your local police Chiefs and get
 
01:48:21.890 --> 01:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
their input and what what they're
 
01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
dealing with on a local basis
 
01:48:26.930 --> 01:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
um daily and maybe even take a trip to
 
01:48:29.330 --> 01:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
your local circuit court and just have a
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
have a look at what's going on there
 
01:48:33.169 --> 01:48:33.179 align:start position:0%
talk to some people come back to the
 
01:48:35.629 --> 01:48:35.639 align:start position:0%
committee with what you find and we'd
 
01:48:37.129 --> 01:48:37.139 align:start position:0%
like to incorporate as much of that as
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
we can I mean we've heard from the folks
 
01:48:41.330 --> 01:48:41.340 align:start position:0%
here that come here but while we're here
 
01:48:42.770 --> 01:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
talking about it real life's going on
 
01:48:46.010 --> 01:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
out there and we want to find out what
 
01:48:47.810 --> 01:48:47.820 align:start position:0%
our local local people are going through
 
01:48:50.629 --> 01:48:50.639 align:start position:0%
too so take a look at the report Dave's
 
01:48:52.250 --> 01:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
going to circulate
 
01:48:54.890 --> 01:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
put a thought to how these these for
 
01:48:56.750 --> 01:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
lack of a better term nuisance crimes
 
01:48:59.330 --> 01:48:59.340 align:start position:0%
that are really what are causing this
 
01:49:01.729 --> 01:49:01.739 align:start position:0%
consternation with the with the citizens
 
01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
in the in the police with the the repeat
 
01:49:06.770 --> 01:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
offenders it's it's generally not the
 
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know the the first degree assaults
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
and the attempted murders it's the
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
shoplifting it's the trespass it's the
 
01:49:15.470 --> 01:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
disorderly person
 
01:49:18.649 --> 01:49:18.659 align:start position:0%
and you know we we need to look at a way
 
01:49:22.010 --> 01:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
to break the cycle of just putting them
 
01:49:23.810 --> 01:49:23.820 align:start position:0%
in jail until they get back out again do
 
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
the same thing we need to look at
 
01:49:28.250 --> 01:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
focusing towards okay we're going to get
 
01:49:30.109 --> 01:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
him off the street but we're not just
 
01:49:30.119 --> 01:49:31.129 align:start position:0%
him off the street but we're not just
gonna

01:49:31.129 --> 01:49:31.139 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
01:49:33.530 --> 01:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
to use David's term Warehouse them we're
 
01:49:35.209 --> 01:49:35.219 align:start position:0%
going to see if we can look at where
 
01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:37.679 align:start position:0%
they need to get these services and
 
01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
connect them with these services and if
 
01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
after having had these Services they
 
01:49:45.050 --> 01:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
continue then it becomes a criminal
 
01:49:47.570 --> 01:49:47.580 align:start position:0%
issue but until then let's see if it's
 
01:49:49.490 --> 01:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
not first in mental health or substance
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
issue that we can actually address with
 
01:49:53.209 --> 01:49:53.219 align:start position:0%
resources that are out there even if
 
01:49:55.490 --> 01:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
it's just connecting them with a private
 
01:49:57.950 --> 01:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
agency that provides these services in
 
01:50:00.109 --> 01:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
the community so that's really all I
 
01:50:02.149 --> 01:50:02.159 align:start position:0%
would ask of you over the next week
 
01:50:03.790 --> 01:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
until we meet again
 
01:50:06.770 --> 01:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
have a care to that visit your Chiefs if
 
01:50:08.990 --> 01:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
you have time and see what's going on in
 
01:50:10.370 --> 01:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
your local communities anyone without
 
01:50:12.050 --> 01:50:12.060 align:start position:0%
any have anything else before we close
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
for the day
 
01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none closing the public hearing
 
01:52:30.649 --> 01:52:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.659 --> 03:03:25.730 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:03:25.730 --> 03:03:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:27.830 --> 03:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everybody it is one
 
03:03:27.840 --> 03:03:28.790 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everybody it is one
o'clock

03:03:28.790 --> 03:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
03:03:32.690 --> 03:03:32.700 align:start position:0%
I am going to open up our subcommittee I
 
03:03:34.849 --> 03:03:34.859 align:start position:0%
think this is a hearing I'm not exactly
 
03:03:37.250 --> 03:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
sure what to call it work session
 
03:03:40.190 --> 03:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
um for our two retained bills the first
 
03:03:42.469 --> 03:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
one we are going to hear is
 
03:03:46.730 --> 03:03:46.740 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 593 FN and we are going to
 
03:03:48.650 --> 03:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
invite representative McGuire to just
 
03:03:50.269 --> 03:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
say a few words
 
03:03:53.510 --> 03:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
before we make any decisions
 
03:03:55.130 --> 03:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
03:03:56.570 --> 03:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Dan
 
03:03:59.389 --> 03:03:59.399 align:start position:0%
McGuire I represent the town of Epsom so
 
03:04:01.670 --> 03:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
I'm the prime sponsor of this bill and
 
03:04:04.670 --> 03:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
I'm here to request that you find it uh
 
03:04:07.190 --> 03:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
in interim study so if you're not
 
03:04:09.530 --> 03:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
familiar with that interim study is
 
03:04:12.530 --> 03:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
emotion applicable to second year bills
 
03:04:14.630 --> 03:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
and because this was retained it's now a
 
03:04:17.450 --> 03:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
second year bill and it's also known as
 
03:04:20.809 --> 03:04:20.819 align:start position:0%
death With Dignity so it it has the
 
03:04:23.750 --> 03:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
effect of somewhat of the effect of itl
 
03:04:26.090 --> 03:04:26.100 align:start position:0%
the bill would not become law but on the
 
03:04:28.730 --> 03:04:28.740 align:start position:0%
other hand the subject matter would
 
03:04:31.550 --> 03:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
still be open in the sense that if a
 
03:04:33.769 --> 03:04:33.779 align:start position:0%
bill came from the senate for example or
 
03:04:36.190 --> 03:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
some other bill in the house
 
03:04:39.410 --> 03:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
was somehow related it could still be be
 
03:04:42.950 --> 03:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
discussed so there's actually been over
 
03:04:45.410 --> 03:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
the summer a fair amount of work going
 
03:04:48.170 --> 03:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
on with this bill you may recall that we
 
03:04:50.389 --> 03:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
had some difficulty with the Judiciary
 
03:04:52.969 --> 03:04:52.979 align:start position:0%
well we've had many meetings with the
 
03:04:55.190 --> 03:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
Judiciary we have new language that
 
03:04:58.130 --> 03:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
they're happy with Etc and so I could
 
03:04:59.870 --> 03:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
have come to you today with like another
 
03:05:02.090 --> 03:05:02.100 align:start position:0%
15-page amendment or something like that
 
03:05:05.389 --> 03:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
but I decided not to do that
 
03:05:09.410 --> 03:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
and um I'll I'll see if if I can work
 
03:05:11.570 --> 03:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
through the process and get that in as
 
03:05:13.910 --> 03:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
another bill some in you know in another
 
03:05:16.730 --> 03:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
way and that's my plan and if not I'll
 
03:05:19.429 --> 03:05:19.439 align:start position:0%
wait on another year but but rather than
 
03:05:22.309 --> 03:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
you know try to rework and rework this
 
03:05:24.830 --> 03:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
bill please uh just find it interim
 
03:05:29.210 --> 03:05:29.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:33.170 --> 03:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:35.150 --> 03:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I have just a question because I
 
03:05:38.090 --> 03:05:38.100 align:start position:0%
mean you told the process of an interim
 
03:05:38.100 --> 03:05:39.710 align:start position:0%
mean you told the process of an interim
study

03:05:39.710 --> 03:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
study
 
03:05:42.290 --> 03:05:42.300 align:start position:0%
um so what what is it in the house rules
 
03:05:44.570 --> 03:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
that that prevents you from just
 
03:05:47.870 --> 03:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
submitting it as a different bill
 
03:05:50.170 --> 03:05:50.180 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks for your question house rule
 
03:05:56.269 --> 03:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
36e says that if a bill is retained or
 
03:05:59.990 --> 03:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
found itl in the first year right it
 
03:06:03.469 --> 03:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
cannot be reintroduced so in order to
 
03:06:06.349 --> 03:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
reintroduce this and my plan is I'm
 
03:06:07.790 --> 03:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
actually going to be breaking it up into
 
03:06:09.530 --> 03:06:09.540 align:start position:0%
three different bills so it's a little
 
03:06:11.870 --> 03:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
more manageable but I have to go to the
 
03:06:14.269 --> 03:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
rules committee so I I'm on the agenda
 
03:06:16.969 --> 03:06:16.979 align:start position:0%
for the rules committee on October 10th
 
03:06:19.309 --> 03:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
to talk about this thank you for the
 
03:06:19.319 --> 03:06:22.010 align:start position:0%
to talk about this thank you for the
explanation

03:06:22.010 --> 03:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:23.570 --> 03:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
does anybody else have any questions for
 
03:06:25.849 --> 03:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
03:06:28.550 --> 03:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
okay so before we take this um this vote
 
03:06:31.070 --> 03:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
I just would like to say real quick that
 
03:06:33.410 --> 03:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
I cannot take credit for the work that
 
03:06:35.389 --> 03:06:35.399 align:start position:0%
is in front of me um this was given to
 
03:06:36.769 --> 03:06:36.779 align:start position:0%
me by somebody who works a lot harder
 
03:06:38.030 --> 03:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
than I do
 
03:06:41.450 --> 03:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
and I do have the history of forfeiture
 
03:06:44.450 --> 03:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
bills over the last couple of years uh
 
03:06:45.950 --> 03:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
some of them
 
03:06:47.870 --> 03:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
have actually been signed into law but
 
03:06:49.610 --> 03:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
will not be going into effect
 
03:06:52.429 --> 03:06:52.439 align:start position:0%
um or actually just went into effect a
 
03:06:54.530 --> 03:06:54.540 align:start position:0%
lot of them are either getting killed on
 
03:06:55.969 --> 03:06:55.979 align:start position:0%
the house floor or they're not making it
 
03:06:57.710 --> 03:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
quite through the Senate
 
03:06:59.929 --> 03:06:59.939 align:start position:0%
and this is I have this here I'm happy
 
03:07:01.130 --> 03:07:01.140 align:start position:0%
to share this with anybody wants to take
 
03:07:02.570 --> 03:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
a look at it
 
03:07:04.250 --> 03:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
um in addition to that I also made a
 
03:07:05.570 --> 03:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
couple of phone calls about this
 
03:07:06.830 --> 03:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
legislation and I did talk with
 
03:07:08.750 --> 03:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire as well
 
03:07:11.030 --> 03:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
and you know when we looked through this
 
03:07:13.130 --> 03:07:13.140 align:start position:0%
and we met the first time
 
03:07:15.469 --> 03:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
and most of you would remember we did
 
03:07:17.690 --> 03:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
have representative Lynn here and we
 
03:07:18.830 --> 03:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
03:07:21.650 --> 03:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
this being so broad does it all belong
 
03:07:23.630 --> 03:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
in criminal justice and that was one of
 
03:07:25.610 --> 03:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
the biggest problems that we had so
 
03:07:28.309 --> 03:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
basically where we are now is
 
03:07:30.830 --> 03:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding and with the
 
03:07:31.849 --> 03:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
conversations I've had with
 
03:07:33.950 --> 03:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
representative that it's going to be
 
03:07:37.550 --> 03:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
broken up into different sections at the
 
03:07:40.010 --> 03:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
at the leadership level and this will
 
03:07:42.110 --> 03:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
not all be coming to Criminal Justice at
 
03:07:43.490 --> 03:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
least not the first time around some of
 
03:07:44.809 --> 03:07:44.819 align:start position:0%
it may be going to Transportation some
 
03:07:46.490 --> 03:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
of it may be gone to Judiciary it's not
 
03:07:48.590 --> 03:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
for me to decide where it goes I just
 
03:07:50.269 --> 03:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
know that it doesn't all necessarily
 
03:07:52.309 --> 03:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
belong in this committee we're not you
 
03:07:54.170 --> 03:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
know the the subject matters to be
 
03:07:56.570 --> 03:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
discussed on those things so
 
03:07:59.090 --> 03:07:59.100 align:start position:0%
with that being said who wants to make a
 
03:07:59.100 --> 03:08:02.690 align:start position:0%
with that being said who wants to make a
motion

03:08:02.690 --> 03:08:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:07.429 --> 03:08:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:10.610 --> 03:08:10.620 align:start position:0%
fantastic do we have a second
 
03:08:13.790 --> 03:08:13.800 align:start position:0%

03:09:01.370 --> 03:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
all right with that we will close the
 
03:09:04.969 --> 03:09:04.979 align:start position:0%

03:09:09.650 --> 03:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
yeah what is this bill number help me
 
03:09:13.309 --> 03:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:14.929 --> 03:09:14.939 align:start position:0%
we are closing the work session for
 
03:09:23.990 --> 03:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:25.969 --> 03:09:25.979 align:start position:0%
do we actually have to wait until 1 30
 
03:09:31.269 --> 03:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:33.590 --> 03:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
so they both weren't just scheduled at
 
03:09:38.110 --> 03:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:49.910 --> 03:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:49.920 --> 03:32:51.969 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:32:51.969 --> 03:32:51.979 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:32:54.590 --> 03:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen it is
 
03:32:58.550 --> 03:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
um 1 30 and the cafeteria only has one
 
03:32:59.990 --> 03:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
person working and we do have a member
 
03:33:01.429 --> 03:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
that is just
 
03:33:03.170 --> 03:33:03.180 align:start position:0%
um coming back back upstairs so we are
 
03:33:04.790 --> 03:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
going to open this and just go into a
 
03:33:06.349 --> 03:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
recess for just a few minutes and so
 
03:33:08.030 --> 03:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
he's able to join us so please bear with
 
03:34:26.750 --> 03:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:28.610 --> 03:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
okay ladies and gentlemen we are now
 
03:34:31.790 --> 03:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
going to reopen the work session for
 
03:34:35.630 --> 03:34:35.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 113 and uh representative
 
03:34:37.490 --> 03:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
Abbott is here who is the main sponsor
 
03:34:51.650 --> 03:34:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:54.710 --> 03:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
yes the only thing I I don't have
 
03:34:56.870 --> 03:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
anything really to add to the testimony
 
03:35:00.530 --> 03:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
I have presented at the public hearing
 
03:35:04.550 --> 03:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
the the only thing I think that uh that
 
03:35:06.530 --> 03:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
this building does
 
03:35:09.830 --> 03:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
um is it does eliminate the state
 
03:35:12.550 --> 03:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
requirements for physical
 
03:35:17.110 --> 03:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
exams it does not limit any
 
03:35:20.830 --> 03:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
local agency from having physical
 
03:35:23.870 --> 03:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
requirements and I think what the
 
03:35:26.710 --> 03:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
situation we find ourselves in today
 
03:35:30.950 --> 03:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
not only on the state level but on the
 
03:35:34.190 --> 03:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
national level is the difficulty in
 
03:35:38.090 --> 03:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
recruiting and retaining police officers
 
03:35:40.929 --> 03:35:40.939 align:start position:0%
and I think that this
 
03:35:45.110 --> 03:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
is should be something that's under
 
03:35:48.170 --> 03:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
local control and not mandated by the
 
03:35:51.349 --> 03:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
state we are the only state that
 
03:35:53.570 --> 03:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
mandates physical requirements for
 
03:35:58.070 --> 03:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
police officers and we also
 
03:35:58.080 --> 03:35:58.610 align:start position:0%
police officers and we also
um

03:35:58.610 --> 03:35:58.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:02.929 --> 03:36:02.939 align:start position:0%
makes it difficulty a very difficult for
 
03:36:05.469 --> 03:36:05.479 align:start position:0%
communities like I represent
 
03:36:09.769 --> 03:36:09.779 align:start position:0%
which are small towns and recruiting and
 
03:36:12.469 --> 03:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
retaining police officers so this is why
 
03:36:16.849 --> 03:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
I put the bill in and I just
 
03:36:19.610 --> 03:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
that's all I have thank you
 
03:36:21.889 --> 03:36:21.899 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:36:24.170 --> 03:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:36:25.969 --> 03:36:25.979 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go ahead and say a few
 
03:36:28.790 --> 03:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
things one is
 
03:36:31.130 --> 03:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
I have had extensive
 
03:36:31.140 --> 03:36:32.750 align:start position:0%
I have had extensive
conversations

03:36:32.750 --> 03:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
03:36:36.229 --> 03:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
um with director skippa and
 
03:36:39.110 --> 03:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
we actually we actually talked about
 
03:36:41.389 --> 03:36:41.399 align:start position:0%
many many different options and one of
 
03:36:42.889 --> 03:36:42.899 align:start position:0%
the things that was discussed was the
 
03:36:45.650 --> 03:36:45.660 align:start position:0%
fact of this being in local control
 
03:36:49.190 --> 03:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
and one of the concerns that I had and
 
03:36:51.590 --> 03:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
after I think about 45 minutes of you
 
03:36:53.690 --> 03:36:53.700 align:start position:0%
know he and I having just a conversation
 
03:36:55.610 --> 03:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I that I was
 
03:36:57.830 --> 03:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
concerned about with that
 
03:36:57.840 --> 03:37:00.290 align:start position:0%
concerned about with that
was

03:37:00.290 --> 03:37:00.300 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:37:04.250 --> 03:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
some towns using this
 
03:37:06.769 --> 03:37:06.779 align:start position:0%
in a negative way so in other words if
 
03:37:08.870 --> 03:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
they had an officer that for whatever
 
03:37:12.170 --> 03:37:12.180 align:start position:0%
reason they wanted to get rid of and
 
03:37:13.790 --> 03:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate that I do know of some
 
03:37:15.590 --> 03:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
examples that I could give but I
 
03:37:17.750 --> 03:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
certainly will not do that
 
03:37:19.670 --> 03:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
that could have been changed they could
 
03:37:21.349 --> 03:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
have said oh we are you know we're not
 
03:37:23.150 --> 03:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
going to require it anymore because you
 
03:37:24.410 --> 03:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
know we're having trouble recruiting or
 
03:37:25.969 --> 03:37:25.979 align:start position:0%
retaining or whatever the reason will be
 
03:37:28.550 --> 03:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden nope we're
 
03:37:30.110 --> 03:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
gonna you know we have so and so that we
 
03:37:31.610 --> 03:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
think is going to have difficulties and
 
03:37:33.710 --> 03:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to switch it and I I was
 
03:37:35.269 --> 03:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
really nervous about a pendulum I didn't
 
03:37:36.590 --> 03:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
want it just going back and forth and
 
03:37:38.690 --> 03:37:38.700 align:start position:0%
being able to change at the will of a
 
03:37:40.490 --> 03:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
police off the police off I'm sorry a
 
03:37:44.330 --> 03:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
police chief or the town selectman
 
03:37:45.710 --> 03:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
um and we did come up with a solution to
 
03:37:48.349 --> 03:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
that however that solution just you know
 
03:37:49.670 --> 03:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
we just kept on going down this Rabbit
 
03:37:51.410 --> 03:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
Hole of every time we turned around
 
03:37:52.969 --> 03:37:52.979 align:start position:0%
there was another obstacle that just
 
03:37:54.410 --> 03:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to be solved with what we
 
03:37:55.670 --> 03:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
were trying to solve
 
03:37:57.769 --> 03:37:57.779 align:start position:0%
so I have a lot more to add but that is
 
03:37:59.090 --> 03:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
at least what I want to say about the
 
03:38:00.710 --> 03:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
local control thing
 
03:38:04.429 --> 03:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
um and I did ask Brad he's done a lot of
 
03:38:07.190 --> 03:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
work for all of us and I did ask him if
 
03:38:10.370 --> 03:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
he would please pull up what other
 
03:38:13.670 --> 03:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
states around us do in New England
 
03:38:15.590 --> 03:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
um I also had him look at what is
 
03:38:17.330 --> 03:38:17.340 align:start position:0%
required to become a police officer in
 
03:38:18.830 --> 03:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire versus other
 
03:38:21.410 --> 03:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
states around us and I actually had him
 
03:38:23.210 --> 03:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
go even a little bit deeper than that
 
03:38:25.370 --> 03:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
and pull up what are the standards for
 
03:38:26.570 --> 03:38:26.580 align:start position:0%
the military
 
03:38:29.690 --> 03:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
and federal positions and one of the
 
03:38:31.969 --> 03:38:31.979 align:start position:0%
things I know for a fact my husband is a
 
03:38:33.830 --> 03:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
railroad engineer I should say he's a
 
03:38:35.570 --> 03:38:35.580 align:start position:0%
railroad locomotive engineer
 
03:38:39.590 --> 03:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
and he is required every year to have a
 
03:38:40.849 --> 03:38:40.859 align:start position:0%
physical he has to have a hearing test
 
03:38:43.969 --> 03:38:43.979 align:start position:0%
he has a sleep apnea test many many that
 
03:38:45.889 --> 03:38:45.899 align:start position:0%
he has to do that is a requirement of
 
03:38:49.070 --> 03:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
his job along with random drug testing
 
03:38:50.750 --> 03:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
at will
 
03:38:52.490 --> 03:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
um used to be every year I do believe
 
03:38:53.870 --> 03:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
they went back to the federal standard
 
03:38:55.429 --> 03:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
which is every three years
 
03:38:58.790 --> 03:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
um and I do know that Pilots also have
 
03:39:00.349 --> 03:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
requirements that they have to do and
 
03:39:02.870 --> 03:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
they also have a mandatory retirement
 
03:39:05.570 --> 03:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
age that I will add right
 
03:39:07.610 --> 03:39:07.620 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know I think Brad sent
 
03:39:09.050 --> 03:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
this to everybody if you didn't get it I
 
03:39:10.610 --> 03:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
do have a copy and you're all welcome to
 
03:39:12.050 --> 03:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
look at it
 
03:39:13.309 --> 03:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
um so that's all I'm going to say about
 
03:39:15.050 --> 03:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
that for now is there anybody else that
 
03:39:18.950 --> 03:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:21.290 --> 03:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler
 
03:39:24.050 --> 03:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
I do think that having standards for our
 
03:39:25.910 --> 03:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
police officers physical standards is is
 
03:39:28.969 --> 03:39:28.979 align:start position:0%
quite important and as was talked about
 
03:39:31.250 --> 03:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
at lunch between representative Muse and
 
03:39:33.170 --> 03:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
myself and representative Newman and
 
03:39:33.180 --> 03:39:34.729 align:start position:0%
myself and representative Newman and
Murphy

03:39:34.729 --> 03:39:34.739 align:start position:0%
Murphy
 
03:39:36.670 --> 03:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has actually been
 
03:39:39.889 --> 03:39:39.899 align:start position:0%
congratulated and given as an example in
 
03:39:41.929 --> 03:39:41.939 align:start position:0%
other states for our physical fitness
 
03:39:44.150 --> 03:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
requirements and I would say that
 
03:39:47.410 --> 03:39:47.420 align:start position:0%
getting rid of them would put the Public
 
03:39:50.809 --> 03:39:50.819 align:start position:0%
Safety in Jeopardy if we have people who
 
03:39:54.410 --> 03:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
can't do the job of a police officer
 
03:39:57.290 --> 03:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
being able to catch a perp if they're
 
03:40:01.309 --> 03:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
running away or any of the very physical
 
03:40:03.530 --> 03:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
tasks that are needed when you're a
 
03:40:05.450 --> 03:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
police officer then that puts our
 
03:40:07.610 --> 03:40:07.620 align:start position:0%
communities at risk it just opens up the
 
03:40:09.290 --> 03:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
door for criminals to be able to know
 
03:40:11.769 --> 03:40:11.779 align:start position:0%
well this town's got some cops that are
 
03:40:14.510 --> 03:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
down and dirty and we can we can do
 
03:40:16.429 --> 03:40:16.439 align:start position:0%
whatever we want here and I think it's
 
03:40:18.110 --> 03:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
important that we have physical fitness
 
03:40:20.809 --> 03:40:20.819 align:start position:0%
requirements so that our cops are doing
 
03:40:23.809 --> 03:40:23.819 align:start position:0%
the job right and well and that they're
 
03:40:27.530 --> 03:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
fit and able to do it and I have seen
 
03:40:29.570 --> 03:40:29.580 align:start position:0%
that in our police officers here in New
 
03:40:32.030 --> 03:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and think it's important to to
 
03:40:33.590 --> 03:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
maintain this so whenever you're ready
 
03:40:39.729 --> 03:40:39.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:43.729 --> 03:40:43.739 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wheeler hold on
 
03:40:46.729 --> 03:40:46.739 align:start position:0%
a minute I think we have some people to
 
03:40:49.490 --> 03:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
have something to say this is being
 
03:40:54.960 --> 03:40:54.970 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:54.970 --> 03:40:59.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

03:40:59.510 --> 03:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:41:03.530 --> 03:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:05.690 --> 03:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
I'm up okay
 
03:41:05.700 --> 03:41:08.210 align:start position:0%
I'm up okay
um

03:41:08.210 --> 03:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:10.550 --> 03:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
I'm for repealing this bill and I'll
 
03:41:12.650 --> 03:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
tell you why I understand the concern
 
03:41:14.690 --> 03:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
about standards and being able to catch
 
03:41:16.969 --> 03:41:16.979 align:start position:0%
a perp however if you look at these
 
03:41:16.979 --> 03:41:18.110 align:start position:0%
a perp however if you look at these
standards

03:41:18.110 --> 03:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
standards
 
03:41:20.990 --> 03:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
a 59 year old police officer has to do
 
03:41:23.090 --> 03:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
the mile and a half run I think it's
 
03:41:25.210 --> 03:41:25.220 align:start position:0%
five seconds
 
03:41:28.429 --> 03:41:28.439 align:start position:0%
slower than an 18 year old female
 
03:41:31.969 --> 03:41:31.979 align:start position:0%
so when we start differentiating
 
03:41:34.370 --> 03:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
genders and ages
 
03:41:35.809 --> 03:41:35.819 align:start position:0%
and there are different standards for
 
03:41:37.670 --> 03:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
each one
 
03:41:39.410 --> 03:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
how does that how does that make uh
 
03:41:41.450 --> 03:41:41.460 align:start position:0%
someone able to catch a perp or be able
 
03:41:43.190 --> 03:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
to do the job better if they don't have
 
03:41:44.929 --> 03:41:44.939 align:start position:0%
to run as fast when they get older or if
 
03:41:46.610 --> 03:41:46.620 align:start position:0%
they're a different gender
 
03:41:49.250 --> 03:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
in addition we're losing experienced
 
03:41:49.260 --> 03:41:50.469 align:start position:0%
in addition we're losing experienced
officers

03:41:50.469 --> 03:41:50.479 align:start position:0%
officers
 
03:41:53.030 --> 03:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
usually those guys that have 25 years 30
 
03:41:54.710 --> 03:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
years on their police Chiefs their
 
03:41:56.690 --> 03:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
captains they're not out there chasing
 
03:41:59.990 --> 03:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
people but they have 30 years experience
 
03:42:01.610 --> 03:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
and we're going to lose that because
 
03:42:05.450 --> 03:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
they can't pass a Physical Agility Test
 
03:42:07.429 --> 03:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
you're not paid to do this to train
 
03:42:10.670 --> 03:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
you're not paid to keep in shape and if
 
03:42:11.809 --> 03:42:11.819 align:start position:0%
you get hurt while you're out there
 
03:42:14.450 --> 03:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
training for your test guess what you're
 
03:42:15.590 --> 03:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
out of a job
 
03:42:16.969 --> 03:42:16.979 align:start position:0%
because workman's comp is not going to
 
03:42:19.309 --> 03:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
cover you
 
03:42:20.690 --> 03:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the only state that
 
03:42:22.670 --> 03:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
requires this every three years
 
03:42:24.050 --> 03:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
in addition we don't require our
 
03:42:25.790 --> 03:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
firefighters to do it or our EMS people
 
03:42:29.269 --> 03:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
to do it just saw police officers
 
03:42:30.650 --> 03:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
I don't think this should be tied to
 
03:42:32.630 --> 03:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
someone's certification I know that most
 
03:42:34.729 --> 03:42:34.739 align:start position:0%
towns have a Physical Agility
 
03:42:37.790 --> 03:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
requirement that's incentive based if
 
03:42:39.110 --> 03:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
you want to take it I know in the towns
 
03:42:40.910 --> 03:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
that I've worked in and just with some
 
03:42:41.750 --> 03:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
background I've worked in law
 
03:42:43.729 --> 03:42:43.739 align:start position:0%
enforcement for 30 years however I'm not
 
03:42:44.929 --> 03:42:44.939 align:start position:0%
a chief
 
03:42:44.939 --> 03:42:45.830 align:start position:0%
a chief
um

03:42:45.830 --> 03:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:45.840 --> 03:42:47.210 align:start position:0%
um
but

03:42:47.210 --> 03:42:47.220 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:42:49.070 --> 03:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
they will pay you to pass it every three
 
03:42:50.210 --> 03:42:50.220 align:start position:0%
years and a lot of guys take that and
 
03:42:51.830 --> 03:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
take that Advantage it's extra money
 
03:42:53.210 --> 03:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
they'll keep in shape and I know a lot
 
03:42:54.710 --> 03:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
of guys will still keep in shape just
 
03:42:56.269 --> 03:42:56.279 align:start position:0%
for that incentive base that each Town
 
03:42:58.490 --> 03:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
provides I don't think tying it to your
 
03:43:00.410 --> 03:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
certification and if you miss a push-up
 
03:43:02.690 --> 03:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
by one or you miss the Run by 10 seconds
 
03:43:09.469 --> 03:43:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:11.990 --> 03:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
this law went into effect I think it was
 
03:43:14.630 --> 03:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
2001 I might be wrong on the date but um
 
03:43:18.170 --> 03:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
prior to that we did fine
 
03:43:20.269 --> 03:43:20.279 align:start position:0%
for however long police officers existed
 
03:43:21.710 --> 03:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
before 2001
 
03:43:24.349 --> 03:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
we had no issues with them being in
 
03:43:26.389 --> 03:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
shape we had no issues with them getting
 
03:43:29.750 --> 03:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
her extra or catching perps we operated
 
03:43:32.990 --> 03:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
be prior to that so
 
03:43:34.849 --> 03:43:34.859 align:start position:0%
I think it's about time we repeal this
 
03:43:36.229 --> 03:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
the standard will stay in place for
 
03:43:38.090 --> 03:43:38.100 align:start position:0%
recruitment when you first get hired to
 
03:43:39.290 --> 03:43:39.300 align:start position:0%
get in the academy and to get out of the
 
03:43:41.330 --> 03:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
academy but after that tying it to your
 
03:43:42.769 --> 03:43:42.779 align:start position:0%
certification I don't I don't think is
 
03:43:44.870 --> 03:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
the way we should be doing it that's it
 
03:43:48.050 --> 03:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:50.630 --> 03:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative Murray Murphy I'm sorry
 
03:43:53.210 --> 03:43:53.220 align:start position:0%
close enough thank you
 
03:43:53.220 --> 03:43:54.050 align:start position:0%
close enough thank you
um

03:43:54.050 --> 03:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:54.060 --> 03:43:55.490 align:start position:0%
um
I I

03:43:55.490 --> 03:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
I I
 
03:43:55.500 --> 03:43:56.150 align:start position:0%
I I
um

03:43:56.150 --> 03:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:58.190 --> 03:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
agree with some of Representative
 
03:44:01.010 --> 03:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
Stone's point the difference I have an
 
03:44:04.250 --> 03:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
opinion is around whether it's
 
03:44:05.990 --> 03:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate to make this decision
 
03:44:09.950 --> 03:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
legislatively or to have police
 
03:44:11.769 --> 03:44:11.779 align:start position:0%
standards in training
 
03:44:15.290 --> 03:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
reassess their current requirements um
 
03:44:17.389 --> 03:44:17.399 align:start position:0%
and I feel like that's the appropriate
 
03:44:20.510 --> 03:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
place for this fully recognizing that
 
03:44:22.429 --> 03:44:22.439 align:start position:0%
any of us as we get older are not going
 
03:44:24.830 --> 03:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
to be as physically fit maybe as as
 
03:44:26.809 --> 03:44:26.819 align:start position:0%
maybe with some mere exceptions
 
03:44:30.170 --> 03:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
um as we were when we were 18 or 19 but
 
03:44:31.729 --> 03:44:31.739 align:start position:0%
if I remember correctly some of the
 
03:44:34.370 --> 03:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
testimony that we had about concern was
 
03:44:36.110 --> 03:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
about liability too
 
03:44:37.670 --> 03:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
um whether a partner wasn't necessarily
 
03:44:40.190 --> 03:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
is in good physical shape whether there
 
03:44:42.590 --> 03:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
would be liability because potential
 
03:44:47.510 --> 03:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
liability for departments if a police
 
03:44:50.630 --> 03:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
officer an incident involving
 
03:44:50.640 --> 03:44:51.410 align:start position:0%
officer an incident involving
um

03:44:51.410 --> 03:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:54.830 --> 03:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
a a police officer that wasn't as
 
03:44:58.130 --> 03:44:58.140 align:start position:0%
physically fit and that it impacted
 
03:44:58.140 --> 03:44:58.729 align:start position:0%
physically fit and that it impacted
um

03:44:58.729 --> 03:44:58.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:00.370 --> 03:45:00.380 align:start position:0%
the public
 
03:45:05.150 --> 03:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
I I support a change if that's deemed
 
03:45:07.309 --> 03:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate but I think that the members
 
03:45:10.210 --> 03:45:10.220 align:start position:0%
should be the people
 
03:45:13.370 --> 03:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
doing this with the department and I
 
03:45:16.130 --> 03:45:16.140 align:start position:0%
would um fully recognizing we are having
 
03:45:18.170 --> 03:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
you know Staffing challenges within the
 
03:45:19.729 --> 03:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
PD I think we're seeing that across the
 
03:45:21.769 --> 03:45:21.779 align:start position:0%
board in many positions
 
03:45:25.250 --> 03:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
um uh I know that right now we only
 
03:45:28.070 --> 03:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
require this every three years and we
 
03:45:30.229 --> 03:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
heard from some officers who had been
 
03:45:30.239 --> 03:45:31.309 align:start position:0%
heard from some officers who had been
given

03:45:31.309 --> 03:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
given
 
03:45:33.469 --> 03:45:33.479 align:start position:0%
um there was some kind of of plan in
 
03:45:36.110 --> 03:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
place for them to have more time to to
 
03:45:38.389 --> 03:45:38.399 align:start position:0%
come into compliance so I think there
 
03:45:40.490 --> 03:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
are exceptions I think there are
 
03:45:42.710 --> 03:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
um there are ways to to
 
03:45:45.050 --> 03:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
um you know before an officer is no
 
03:45:47.090 --> 03:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
longer certified there are things in
 
03:45:47.100 --> 03:45:47.750 align:start position:0%
longer certified there are things in
place

03:45:47.750 --> 03:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
place
 
03:45:50.570 --> 03:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
um and I I feel that the place for this
 
03:45:52.790 --> 03:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
to happen is actually with police
 
03:45:55.309 --> 03:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
standards and training and not for us to
 
03:45:55.319 --> 03:45:56.830 align:start position:0%
standards and training and not for us to
legislatively

03:45:56.830 --> 03:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
legislatively
 
03:46:01.070 --> 03:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
decide that we we would not have uh
 
03:46:02.929 --> 03:46:02.939 align:start position:0%
um that this you know to remove this
 
03:46:05.090 --> 03:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
from from RSA
 
03:46:08.030 --> 03:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
03:46:08.040 --> 03:46:10.570 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
um

03:46:10.570 --> 03:46:10.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:14.110 --> 03:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:16.849 --> 03:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
and to representative Murphy's point we
 
03:46:19.130 --> 03:46:19.140 align:start position:0%
we did have a really good robust
 
03:46:21.590 --> 03:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
discussion during the uh the hearing
 
03:46:23.450 --> 03:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
process and and the executive session
 
03:46:25.790 --> 03:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
around possible alternatives
 
03:46:27.710 --> 03:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
so I think one of the things we learned
 
03:46:29.510 --> 03:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
from police standards in training is
 
03:46:33.250 --> 03:46:33.260 align:start position:0%
that the way that they currently do it
 
03:46:36.530 --> 03:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
that particular methodology is a couple
 
03:46:38.510 --> 03:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
of decades old and they're they're
 
03:46:40.729 --> 03:46:40.739 align:start position:0%
looking at changing it one of the things
 
03:46:42.469 --> 03:46:42.479 align:start position:0%
that I suggested
 
03:46:44.530 --> 03:46:44.540 align:start position:0%
um as a way of
 
03:46:47.269 --> 03:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
losing some of those good officers who
 
03:46:49.250 --> 03:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
basically can't meet the physical
 
03:46:52.370 --> 03:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
standards anymore was creating uh some
 
03:46:55.010 --> 03:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
type of an alternative a wellness
 
03:46:56.929 --> 03:46:56.939 align:start position:0%
program for example that they could
 
03:47:00.290 --> 03:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
participate in and potentially not uh
 
03:47:03.050 --> 03:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
you know and and potentially not loser
 
03:47:03.060 --> 03:47:04.849 align:start position:0%
you know and and potentially not loser
certification

03:47:04.849 --> 03:47:04.859 align:start position:0%
certification
 
03:47:07.670 --> 03:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
um but you know we when we start to get
 
03:47:09.349 --> 03:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
into things like that what we start to
 
03:47:11.090 --> 03:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
get into is sort of what I think we
 
03:47:13.910 --> 03:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
should avoid which is the legislature
 
03:47:16.309 --> 03:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
um micromanaging you know the the
 
03:47:18.650 --> 03:47:18.660 align:start position:0%
agencies and and I do think that there
 
03:47:20.750 --> 03:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
are people in police standards in
 
03:47:23.809 --> 03:47:23.819 align:start position:0%
training who are underwear you know
 
03:47:26.210 --> 03:47:26.220 align:start position:0%
they're aware of the fact that the
 
03:47:27.650 --> 03:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
legislature has told them that we have
 
03:47:29.990 --> 03:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
to have these standards but to a large
 
03:47:31.849 --> 03:47:31.859 align:start position:0%
extent I mean we've left it up to them
 
03:47:34.490 --> 03:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
to decide what the standard should be
 
03:47:36.290 --> 03:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
so if the standards aren't working if
 
03:47:38.150 --> 03:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
we're losing people because of it I
 
03:47:41.269 --> 03:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
think that's a wake-up call for police
 
03:47:43.790 --> 03:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
standards in training to really take a
 
03:47:45.590 --> 03:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
good look at those standards
 
03:47:48.170 --> 03:47:48.180 align:start position:0%
um but I don't necessarily think it's a
 
03:47:50.809 --> 03:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
wake-up call for the legislature to get
 
03:47:53.630 --> 03:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
rid of them especially
 
03:47:56.750 --> 03:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
not one even even the police themselves
 
03:47:59.389 --> 03:47:59.399 align:start position:0%
who testified so I it was it's always
 
03:48:02.030 --> 03:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
unusual for the for the Chiefs of Police
 
03:48:03.950 --> 03:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
Association to come and testify on a
 
03:48:05.929 --> 03:48:05.939 align:start position:0%
bill and be neutral about it and the
 
03:48:07.490 --> 03:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
reason they were neutral about it is
 
03:48:10.130 --> 03:48:10.140 align:start position:0%
well there was some disagreement even
 
03:48:12.590 --> 03:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
among among the Chiefs about whether or
 
03:48:15.170 --> 03:48:15.180 align:start position:0%
not repeal was a good idea
 
03:48:19.070 --> 03:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
so you know what what I would say is it
 
03:48:23.090 --> 03:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
it might be a better idea to see what
 
03:48:26.030 --> 03:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
police standards in training can do uh
 
03:48:28.309 --> 03:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
to to continue to be in contact with
 
03:48:28.319 --> 03:48:29.570 align:start position:0%
to to continue to be in contact with
them

03:48:29.570 --> 03:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:48:33.769 --> 03:48:33.779 align:start position:0%
um but um in terms of repealing the
 
03:48:36.050 --> 03:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
existing law I I think we should give it
 
03:48:38.150 --> 03:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit more time to play out and
 
03:48:41.389 --> 03:48:41.399 align:start position:0%
time for those discussions to play out
 
03:48:42.889 --> 03:48:42.899 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
03:48:42.899 --> 03:48:44.090 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
finzar

03:48:44.090 --> 03:48:44.100 align:start position:0%
finzar
 
03:48:46.610 --> 03:48:46.620 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I'm not recommending this
 
03:48:47.990 --> 03:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
at all but if you really want to measure
 
03:48:49.429 --> 03:48:49.439 align:start position:0%
physical fitness it should be tested
 
03:48:51.590 --> 03:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
every six months I mean three years just
 
03:48:53.389 --> 03:48:53.399 align:start position:0%
seems arbitrary and you could get out of
 
03:48:54.650 --> 03:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
shape for two and a half years and
 
03:48:56.570 --> 03:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
really bust your butt to get in shape so
 
03:48:59.269 --> 03:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
these quote unquote fat cop you could be
 
03:49:00.710 --> 03:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
a fat cop for two and a half years get
 
03:49:02.269 --> 03:49:02.279 align:start position:0%
in shape past the test and be a fat cop
 
03:49:11.030 --> 03:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:13.070 --> 03:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler
 
03:49:14.690 --> 03:49:14.700 align:start position:0%
well I just wanted to say I appreciate
 
03:49:16.790 --> 03:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh what my friend representative Manion
 
03:49:19.550 --> 03:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
talked about uh in his opposition to
 
03:49:21.889 --> 03:49:21.899 align:start position:0%
this what I would say is I agree that
 
03:49:25.550 --> 03:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
there is a problem with retention and
 
03:49:28.210 --> 03:49:28.220 align:start position:0%
staffing issues within the police
 
03:49:30.769 --> 03:49:30.779 align:start position:0%
within the industry of police but I I
 
03:49:35.389 --> 03:49:35.399 align:start position:0%
don't know if the data Bears out that it
 
03:49:38.210 --> 03:49:38.220 align:start position:0%
is the standards that is causing there
 
03:49:41.510 --> 03:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
to be a lack of uh Staffing shortages I
 
03:49:43.370 --> 03:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
think those Staffing shortages come more
 
03:49:47.450 --> 03:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
from a lack of adequate pay in a world
 
03:49:50.030 --> 03:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
where the cost of living has increased
 
03:49:52.910 --> 03:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
so greatly over these last four six
 
03:49:55.370 --> 03:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
years and I
 
03:49:58.370 --> 03:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
um would say that us as a state living
 
03:50:00.110 --> 03:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
up to Our obligation and trying to
 
03:50:02.330 --> 03:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
adequately pay people more and looking
 
03:50:03.889 --> 03:50:03.899 align:start position:0%
into other things I'd be happy to look
 
03:50:06.950 --> 03:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
into how we could retain uh employees
 
03:50:08.690 --> 03:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
state employees including our police
 
03:50:11.210 --> 03:50:11.220 align:start position:0%
officers in a
 
03:50:14.450 --> 03:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
more Humane and just way paying them
 
03:50:16.490 --> 03:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
adequately but I don't know if getting
 
03:50:18.889 --> 03:50:18.899 align:start position:0%
rid of the standards that has made New
 
03:50:21.530 --> 03:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire police officers solid and
 
03:50:24.370 --> 03:50:24.380 align:start position:0%
secure over these last uh
 
03:50:27.889 --> 03:50:27.899 align:start position:0%
22 years since 2001
 
03:50:27.899 --> 03:50:28.610 align:start position:0%
22 years since 2001
um

03:50:28.610 --> 03:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:31.070 --> 03:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
is the way to get that done um I think
 
03:50:33.950 --> 03:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
that lowers the standard uh lowers the
 
03:50:36.650 --> 03:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
bar of where our police officers are at
 
03:50:39.769 --> 03:50:39.779 align:start position:0%
which may yes in turn get us more people
 
03:50:42.590 --> 03:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
in that job but that lowers the standard
 
03:50:45.170 --> 03:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
uh and I think that it's important
 
03:50:49.370 --> 03:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
especially for people who are enforcing
 
03:50:52.610 --> 03:50:52.620 align:start position:0%
Justice on the streets to have a high
 
03:50:54.950 --> 03:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
standard for those um and I think New
 
03:50:56.690 --> 03:50:56.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should be proud that we have
 
03:50:58.910 --> 03:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
that high standard right now I would
 
03:51:01.429 --> 03:51:01.439 align:start position:0%
agree with representative tenzar that I
 
03:51:03.590 --> 03:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
think the three-year number is a an
 
03:51:06.170 --> 03:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
arbitrary one that is trying to play
 
03:51:08.330 --> 03:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
Both Sides um but I would also agree
 
03:51:09.590 --> 03:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
with representative Muse that that
 
03:51:11.929 --> 03:51:11.939 align:start position:0%
should be up to police standards and
 
03:51:13.429 --> 03:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
training and and we shouldn't be
 
03:51:15.469 --> 03:51:15.479 align:start position:0%
micromanaging it here I think this just
 
03:51:17.690 --> 03:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
opens up a can of worms for peeling this
 
03:51:20.630 --> 03:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't be beneficial for the
 
03:51:22.790 --> 03:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
legislature to engage in and I think
 
03:51:24.769 --> 03:51:24.779 align:start position:0%
that I apologize for jumping the gun
 
03:51:26.990 --> 03:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
with my motion earlier I just really
 
03:51:29.570 --> 03:51:29.580 align:start position:0%
wanted to get out of here but I but I I
 
03:51:32.389 --> 03:51:32.399 align:start position:0%
do but I I really appreciate this debate
 
03:51:34.670 --> 03:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
as well um so I would just say like yes
 
03:51:36.110 --> 03:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
if we want if we want to work on
 
03:51:37.670 --> 03:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
retention I'd be happy to work on
 
03:51:39.889 --> 03:51:39.899 align:start position:0%
retention uh with you but I don't think
 
03:51:41.750 --> 03:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
03:51:44.030 --> 03:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
lowering the standard
 
03:51:46.910 --> 03:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
for our police officers and and the
 
03:51:48.889 --> 03:51:48.899 align:start position:0%
physical physical fitness requirements
 
03:51:51.950 --> 03:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
they have uh is the way to do that
 
03:51:57.290 --> 03:51:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:58.969 --> 03:51:58.979 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just want to go
 
03:51:59.870 --> 03:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
on the record saying that this doesn't
 
03:52:01.370 --> 03:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
affect me either way
 
03:52:02.809 --> 03:52:02.819 align:start position:0%
um whether it passes or it's repealed
 
03:52:05.630 --> 03:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
just so it doesn't affect my position so
 
03:52:06.710 --> 03:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
I just want to go on the record and say
 
03:52:09.889 --> 03:52:09.899 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative Muse
 
03:52:13.070 --> 03:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
you're well set thanks
 
03:52:15.830 --> 03:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
okay so one of the things that I would
 
03:52:17.510 --> 03:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
like to point out that I think is very
 
03:52:20.510 --> 03:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
important for everybody to understand is
 
03:52:22.849 --> 03:52:22.859 align:start position:0%
that the police standards and Training
 
03:52:25.670 --> 03:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
Academy does have the ability to to
 
03:52:28.670 --> 03:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
change some of these rules and I also
 
03:52:30.889 --> 03:52:30.899 align:start position:0%
know that they are allowed to make
 
03:52:33.830 --> 03:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodations also for for
 
03:52:33.840 --> 03:52:35.450 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodations also for for
officers

03:52:35.450 --> 03:52:35.460 align:start position:0%
officers
 
03:52:35.460 --> 03:52:35.990 align:start position:0%
officers
um

03:52:35.990 --> 03:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:38.870 --> 03:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
I do know that you know it has right
 
03:52:40.849 --> 03:52:40.859 align:start position:0%
here in what I have it says any officer
 
03:52:42.170 --> 03:52:42.180 align:start position:0%
who's unable to obtain the medical
 
03:52:44.870 --> 03:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
clearance shall have shall have his or
 
03:52:46.929 --> 03:52:46.939 align:start position:0%
her certification placed in
 
03:52:49.130 --> 03:52:49.140 align:start position:0%
probationary status for a period of six
 
03:52:50.750 --> 03:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
months which I'll be extended by the
 
03:52:52.910 --> 03:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
Council of good causes is defined and
 
03:52:55.130 --> 03:52:55.140 align:start position:0%
then it continues to go on
 
03:52:58.790 --> 03:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
um so I do know that you know in the
 
03:53:00.830 --> 03:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
event that the officer is not able to
 
03:53:02.990 --> 03:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason you know pass that
 
03:53:05.809 --> 03:53:05.819 align:start position:0%
test at that time they do have the
 
03:53:07.670 --> 03:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
they they are able to go back and try
 
03:53:11.750 --> 03:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
again and if I'm not mistaken I think
 
03:53:13.670 --> 03:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
that's like a couple of years like it
 
03:53:15.410 --> 03:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
doesn't just stop and I could be wrong
 
03:53:16.849 --> 03:53:16.859 align:start position:0%
but I don't see anybody shaking their
 
03:53:19.190 --> 03:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
head at me so I think I might be okay
 
03:53:21.469 --> 03:53:21.479 align:start position:0%
um and the other thing that I think
 
03:53:23.510 --> 03:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
everybody here has kind of mentioned but
 
03:53:24.950 --> 03:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
I know representative Muse definitely
 
03:53:24.960 --> 03:53:26.450 align:start position:0%
I know representative Muse definitely
did

03:53:26.450 --> 03:53:26.460 align:start position:0%
did
 
03:53:28.309 --> 03:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:53:30.710 --> 03:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
this was a really healthy conversation
 
03:53:32.330 --> 03:53:32.340 align:start position:0%
we had in here and it also was
 
03:53:35.690 --> 03:53:35.700 align:start position:0%
incredibly healthy when the officers
 
03:53:38.090 --> 03:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
themselves are all here testifying and
 
03:53:40.849 --> 03:53:40.859 align:start position:0%
the problem that I'm having
 
03:53:42.710 --> 03:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:53:45.110 --> 03:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
every single person I talk to for
 
03:53:47.809 --> 03:53:47.819 align:start position:0%
everything every two people I talk to
 
03:53:49.429 --> 03:53:49.439 align:start position:0%
they're split
 
03:53:51.889 --> 03:53:51.899 align:start position:0%
they are split nobody seems to be able
 
03:53:55.330 --> 03:53:55.340 align:start position:0%
to just have the solution to the problem
 
03:53:57.769 --> 03:53:57.779 align:start position:0%
even if there is a problem and
 
03:54:02.690 --> 03:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
additionally I do know that the the the
 
03:54:04.910 --> 03:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
um the Chiefs Association did send out a
 
03:54:08.630 --> 03:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
survey and that came back split and they
 
03:54:13.250 --> 03:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
had a very low return rate so you know
 
03:54:15.170 --> 03:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
they're not even able to make a decision
 
03:54:16.729 --> 03:54:16.739 align:start position:0%
so without them being able to make a
 
03:54:18.229 --> 03:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
decision I don't really see that it's
 
03:54:21.050 --> 03:54:21.060 align:start position:0%
our position to make it for them I think
 
03:54:24.290 --> 03:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
that that may be insulting
 
03:54:26.269 --> 03:54:26.279 align:start position:0%
um so with that being said does anybody
 
03:54:29.210 --> 03:54:29.220 align:start position:0%
else have anything to say
 
03:54:32.030 --> 03:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
I just had this one yes you may thank
 
03:54:32.040 --> 03:54:33.110 align:start position:0%
I just had this one yes you may thank
you

03:54:33.110 --> 03:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:54:35.090 --> 03:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
um I understand that the decision was
 
03:54:37.250 --> 03:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
made in 2001 by the legislature to make
 
03:54:38.330 --> 03:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
this a law
 
03:54:40.250 --> 03:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
so we did get involved in it we didn't
 
03:54:42.170 --> 03:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
make the decision to have it every three
 
03:54:43.490 --> 03:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
years so
 
03:54:46.610 --> 03:54:46.620 align:start position:0%
maybe they screwed up
 
03:54:49.309 --> 03:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler
 
03:54:51.530 --> 03:54:51.540 align:start position:0%

03:54:58.910 --> 03:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
