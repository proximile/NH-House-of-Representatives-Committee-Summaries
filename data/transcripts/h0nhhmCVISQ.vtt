00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
yeah sure so I I think the answer to
 

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.669 align:start position:0%
yeah sure so I I think the answer to
your<00:23:55.840><c> question</c><00:23:56.120><c> is</c><00:23:56.360><c> yes</c><00:23:56.520><c> in</c><00:23:56.640><c> other</c><00:23:56.799><c> words</c><00:23:57.039><c> as</c><00:23:57.200><c> I</c>

00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
your question is yes in other words as I
 

00:23:57.679 --> 00:24:00.549 align:start position:0%
your question is yes in other words as I
understand<00:23:57.960><c> and</c><00:23:58.120><c> that</c><00:23:58.440><c> the</c><00:23:58.760><c> the</c><00:23:59.400><c> whole</c><00:24:00.400><c> the</c>

00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
understand and that the the whole the
 

00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:03.830 align:start position:0%
understand and that the the whole the
whole<00:24:00.919><c> rationale</c><00:24:01.600><c> for</c><00:24:01.880><c> this</c><00:24:02.159><c> is</c><00:24:03.000><c> that</c><00:24:03.600><c> the</c>

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
whole rationale for this is that the
 

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.710 align:start position:0%
whole rationale for this is that the
Department<00:24:04.520><c> of</c><00:24:04.919><c> Education</c><00:24:05.679><c> has</c><00:24:06.080><c> the</c>

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has the
 

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.549 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has the
authority<00:24:07.720><c> to</c><00:24:08.360><c> regulate</c><00:24:08.919><c> teachers</c><00:24:09.360><c> and</c>

00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559 align:start position:0%
authority to regulate teachers and
 

00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:11.710 align:start position:0%
authority to regulate teachers and
regulate<00:24:09.960><c> their</c><00:24:10.159><c> licensing</c><00:24:11.000><c> and</c><00:24:11.279><c> you</c><00:24:11.400><c> know</c>

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:11.720 align:start position:0%
regulate their licensing and you know
 

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.110 align:start position:0%
regulate their licensing and you know
suspend<00:24:12.159><c> them</c><00:24:12.279><c> or</c><00:24:12.440><c> whatever</c><00:24:12.840><c> and</c><00:24:12.960><c> so</c><00:24:13.240><c> it's</c><00:24:13.960><c> and</c>

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
suspend them or whatever and so it's and
 

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.909 align:start position:0%
suspend them or whatever and so it's and
hold<00:24:14.440><c> hearings</c><00:24:14.919><c> for</c><00:24:15.120><c> the</c><00:24:15.240><c> purpose</c><00:24:15.520><c> of</c><00:24:15.640><c> doing</c>

00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
hold hearings for the purpose of doing
 

00:24:15.919 --> 00:24:20.669 align:start position:0%
hold hearings for the purpose of doing
that<00:24:16.200><c> and</c><00:24:16.320><c> so</c><00:24:17.080><c> I</c><00:24:17.159><c> think</c><00:24:17.520><c> it</c><00:24:17.679><c> is</c><00:24:17.919><c> limited</c><00:24:18.520><c> to</c>

00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
that and so I think it is limited to

I guess my other question really is that
 

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.470 align:start position:0%
I guess my other question really is that
you<00:44:03.160><c> mentioned</c><00:44:03.520><c> on</c><00:44:03.640><c> the</c><00:44:03.760><c> one</c><00:44:04.040><c> hand</c><00:44:04.240><c> that</c><00:44:04.359><c> you</c>

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
felt that it was too broad but then on

felt that it was too broad but then on
the<00:44:07.359><c> other</c><00:44:07.640><c> hand</c><00:44:08.160><c> you</c><00:44:08.359><c> kind</c>

question I am really confused I read
this<03:08:25.200><c> bill</c><03:08:25.960><c> and</c><03:08:26.960><c> it</c><03:08:27.080><c> didn't</c><03:08:27.319><c> sink</c><03:08:27.600><c> in</c><03:08:28.399><c> um</c><03:08:29.160><c> so</c>

03:08:30.150 --> 03:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
this bill and it didn't sink in um so
 

03:08:30.160 --> 03:08:32.110 align:start position:0%
this bill and it didn't sink in um so
we're<03:08:30.399><c> talking</c><03:08:30.760><c> about</c><03:08:31.200><c> uh</c><03:08:31.319><c> yield</c><03:08:31.680><c> star</c>

03:08:32.110 --> 03:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about uh yield star
 

03:08:32.120 --> 03:08:36.550 align:start position:0%
we're talking about uh yield star
software<03:08:32.680><c> what</c><03:08:32.760><c> do</c><03:08:32.960><c> they</c><03:08:33.439><c> do</c><03:08:34.439><c> so</c><03:08:34.840><c> basically</c>

03:08:36.550 --> 03:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
software what do they do so basically
 

03:08:36.560 --> 03:08:43.950 align:start position:0%
software what do they do so basically
um<03:08:37.880><c> so</c><03:08:38.920><c> basically</c><03:08:39.920><c> landlords</c><03:08:41.279><c> will</c><03:08:42.279><c> um</c>

03:08:43.950 --> 03:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
um so basically landlords will um
 

03:08:43.960 --> 03:08:47.389 align:start position:0%
um so basically landlords will um
use<03:08:44.319><c> this</c><03:08:44.560><c> software</c><03:08:45.120><c> to</c><03:08:45.760><c> um</c><03:08:46.000><c> for</c><03:08:46.479><c> advice</c><03:08:47.040><c> about</c>

03:08:47.389 --> 03:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
use this software to um for advice about
 

03:08:47.399 --> 03:08:49.429 align:start position:0%
use this software to um for advice about
what<03:08:47.560><c> they</c><03:08:47.720><c> cons</c><03:08:47.920><c> sent</c><03:08:48.200><c> the</c><03:08:48.359><c> r</c><03:08:48.640><c> to</c><03:08:48.920><c> they'll</c><03:08:49.120><c> say</c>

03:08:49.429 --> 03:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
what they cons sent the r to they'll say
 

03:08:49.439 --> 03:08:51.710 align:start position:0%
what they cons sent the r to they'll say
like<03:08:50.439><c> um</c><03:08:50.720><c> okay</c><03:08:50.880><c> this</c><03:08:51.040><c> is</c><03:08:51.120><c> what</c><03:08:51.239><c> my</c><03:08:51.399><c> current</c>

03:08:51.710 --> 03:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
like um okay this is what my current
 

03:08:51.720 --> 03:08:53.670 align:start position:0%
like um okay this is what my current
rant<03:08:52.120><c> is</c><03:08:52.279><c> and</c><03:08:52.399><c> then</c><03:08:52.560><c> the</c><03:08:52.680><c> software</c><03:08:53.160><c> will</c><03:08:53.319><c> say</c>

03:08:53.670 --> 03:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
rant is and then the software will say
 

03:08:53.680 --> 03:08:56.630 align:start position:0%
rant is and then the software will say
oh<03:08:53.960><c> well</c><03:08:54.279><c> actually</c><03:08:54.720><c> how</c><03:08:54.880><c> about</c><03:08:55.200><c> you</c><03:08:55.640><c> try</c>

03:08:56.630 --> 03:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
oh well actually how about you try
 

03:08:56.640 --> 03:08:59.590 align:start position:0%
oh well actually how about you try
setting<03:08:57.080><c> it</c><03:08:57.319><c> to</c><03:08:57.800><c> this</c><03:08:58.000><c> value</c><03:08:58.439><c> instead</c><03:08:59.120><c> so</c><03:08:59.439><c> then</c>

03:08:59.590 --> 03:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
setting it to this value instead so then
 

03:08:59.600 --> 03:09:03.269 align:start position:0%
setting it to this value instead so then
they<03:08:59.720><c> go</c><03:08:59.840><c> and</c><03:09:00.000><c> do</c><03:09:00.239><c> that</c><03:09:00.560><c> and</c><03:09:01.319><c> then</c><03:09:01.560><c> they</c><03:09:01.720><c> can</c>

03:09:03.269 --> 03:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
they go and do that and then they can
 

03:09:03.279 --> 03:09:07.229 align:start position:0%
they go and do that and then they can
um<03:09:04.279><c> they</c><03:09:05.120><c> whe</c><03:09:05.319><c> When</c><03:09:05.600><c> the</c><03:09:05.920><c> tenants</c><03:09:06.359><c> ask</c><03:09:06.680><c> hey</c><03:09:06.880><c> why</c>

03:09:07.229 --> 03:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
um they whe When the tenants ask hey why

03:14:36.910 --> 03:14:36.920 align:start position:0%

03:14:36.920 --> 03:14:40.550 align:start position:0%

representative<03:14:37.600><c> saying</c><03:14:38.040><c> that</c><03:14:38.800><c> so</c><03:14:39.439><c> um</c><03:14:40.319><c> it's</c>

03:14:40.550 --> 03:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative saying that so um it's
 

03:14:40.560 --> 03:14:42.750 align:start position:0%
representative saying that so um it's
basically<03:14:41.080><c> just</c><03:14:41.760><c> you</c><03:14:41.960><c> have</c><03:14:42.080><c> to</c><03:14:42.239><c> take</c><03:14:42.600><c> their</c>

03:14:42.750 --> 03:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
basically just you have to take their
 

03:14:42.760 --> 03:14:46.389 align:start position:0%
basically just you have to take their
word<03:14:43.000><c> for</c><03:14:43.279><c> it</c><03:14:44.160><c> that</c><03:14:44.560><c> that's</c><03:14:44.760><c> how</c><03:14:44.920><c> it</c><03:14:45.120><c> works</c><03:14:45.960><c> um</c>

03:14:46.389 --> 03:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
word for it that that's how it works um
 

03:14:46.399 --> 03:14:50.349 align:start position:0%
word for it that that's how it works um
and<03:14:47.200><c> I</c><03:14:47.359><c> think</c><03:14:48.319><c> further</c><03:14:48.960><c> investigation</c><03:14:49.840><c> if</c>

03:14:50.349 --> 03:14:50.359 align:start position:0%
and I think further investigation if
 

03:14:50.359 --> 03:14:52.030 align:start position:0%
and I think further investigation if
into<03:14:50.840><c> whether</c><03:14:51.080><c> they're</c><03:14:51.279><c> telling</c><03:14:51.600><c> the</c><03:14:51.760><c> truth</c>

03:14:52.040 --> 03:14:54.510 align:start position:0%

03:14:54.510 --> 03:14:54.520 align:start position:0%

03:28:11.870 --> 03:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
brought up at trial into the sentence
 

03:28:11.880 --> 03:28:14.830 align:start position:0%

and<03:28:12.000><c> that</c><03:28:12.279><c> also</c><03:28:12.720><c> increases</c><03:28:13.199><c> the</c><03:28:13.319><c> sentence</c><03:28:14.160><c> so</c>

03:28:14.830 --> 03:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
and that also increases the sentence so
 

03:28:14.840 --> 03:28:17.750 align:start position:0%
and that also increases the sentence so
hence<03:28:15.120><c> the</c><03:28:15.279><c> reason</c><03:28:15.640><c> most</c><03:28:15.880><c> people</c><03:28:16.399><c> 97%</c><03:28:17.399><c> plead</c>

03:30:46.590 --> 03:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
the worst sentence what what do I think
 

03:30:46.600 --> 03:30:48.990 align:start position:0%
the worst sentence what what do I think
as<03:30:46.720><c> a</c><03:30:46.960><c> prosecutor</c><03:30:47.840><c> is</c><03:30:48.080><c> what</c><03:30:48.239><c> the</c><03:30:48.439><c> sentence</c>

03:30:48.990 --> 03:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
as a prosecutor is what the sentence
 

03:30:49.000 --> 03:30:52.950 align:start position:0%
as a prosecutor is what the sentence
should<03:30:49.680><c> be</c><03:30:50.680><c> and</c><03:30:51.479><c> okay</c><03:30:51.880><c> I</c><03:30:52.160><c> and</c><03:30:52.359><c> so</c><03:30:52.600><c> as</c><03:30:52.760><c> let's</c>

03:30:52.950 --> 03:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
should be and okay I and so as let's
 

03:30:52.960 --> 03:30:55.070 align:start position:0%
should be and okay I and so as let's
assume<03:30:53.239><c> in</c><03:30:53.399><c> some</c><03:30:53.800><c> hypothetical</c><03:30:54.359><c> case</c><03:30:54.600><c> I</c><03:30:54.720><c> say</c><03:30:54.960><c> I</c>

03:30:55.070 --> 03:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
assume in some hypothetical case I say I
 

03:30:55.080 --> 03:30:57.189 align:start position:0%
assume in some hypothetical case I say I
think<03:30:55.279><c> the</c><03:30:55.520><c> pro</c><03:30:55.800><c> the</c><03:30:56.279><c> the</c><03:30:56.399><c> sentence</c><03:30:56.760><c> should</c><03:30:57.000><c> be</c>

03:30:57.189 --> 03:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
think the pro the the sentence should be
 

03:30:57.199 --> 03:30:59.990 align:start position:0%
think the pro the the sentence should be
10<03:30:57.479><c> years</c><03:30:58.319><c> so</c><03:30:58.600><c> now</c><03:30:58.880><c> if</c><03:30:59.040><c> this</c><03:30:59.160><c> is</c><03:30:59.319><c> an</c><03:30:59.520><c> effect</c><03:30:59.840><c> I</c>

03:30:59.990 --> 03:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
10 years so now if this is an effect I
 

03:31:00.000 --> 03:31:04.429 align:start position:0%
10 years so now if this is an effect I
know<03:31:00.880><c> that</c><03:31:01.080><c> I</c><03:31:01.279><c> can't</c><03:31:01.680><c> offer</c><03:31:02.160><c> a</c><03:31:02.439><c> sentence</c><03:31:03.439><c> less</c>

03:31:04.429 --> 03:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
know that I can't offer a sentence less
 

03:31:04.439 --> 03:31:08.150 align:start position:0%
know that I can't offer a sentence less
than<03:31:04.880><c> um</c><03:31:05.520><c> uh</c><03:31:06.239><c> more</c><03:31:06.439><c> than</c><03:31:06.640><c> 90</c><03:31:07.359><c> I</c><03:31:07.439><c> mean</c><03:31:07.680><c> less</c><03:31:07.960><c> than</c>

03:31:08.150 --> 03:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
than um uh more than 90 I mean less than
 

03:31:08.160 --> 03:31:10.750 align:start position:0%
than um uh more than 90 I mean less than
90%<03:31:08.840><c> of</c><03:31:09.000><c> that</c><03:31:09.319><c> because</c><03:31:10.040><c> if</c><03:31:10.160><c> I</c><03:31:10.279><c> do</c><03:31:10.520><c> then</c><03:31:10.640><c> the</c>

03:31:10.750 --> 03:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
90% of that because if I do then the
 

03:31:10.760 --> 03:31:12.630 align:start position:0%
90% of that because if I do then the
judge<03:31:11.160><c> will</c><03:31:11.239><c> be</c><03:31:11.359><c> barred</c><03:31:11.720><c> from</c><03:31:12.000><c> imposing</c><03:31:12.520><c> what</c>

03:31:15.630 --> 03:31:15.640 align:start position:0%
I think is a good sentence so why would

06:10:57.110 --> 06:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
and so you'd have to go back to 210
 

06:10:57.120 --> 06:11:01.990 align:start position:0%
and so you'd have to go back to 210
um<06:10:57.520><c> and</c><06:10:57.680><c> change</c><06:10:58.160><c> that</c><06:10:58.680><c> as</c><06:10:58.958><c> well</c><06:11:00.320><c> um</c><06:11:01.320><c> so</c><06:11:01.718><c> I</c><06:11:01.920><c> I</c>

06:11:01.990 --> 06:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
um and change that as well um so I I
 

06:11:02.000 --> 06:11:04.030 align:start position:0%
um and change that as well um so I I
think<06:11:02.240><c> that</c><06:11:02.440><c> might</c><06:11:02.878><c> answer</c><06:11:03.320><c> some</c><06:11:03.558><c> of</c><06:11:03.878><c> the</c>

06:11:04.030 --> 06:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
think that might answer some of the
 

06:11:04.040 --> 06:11:05.390 align:start position:0%
think that might answer some of the

06:11:07.670 --> 06:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
on that to see if you have more and then
 

06:11:07.680 --> 06:11:10.830 align:start position:0%
on that to see if you have more and then
I'll<06:11:07.920><c> continue</c><06:11:08.718><c> I</c><06:11:08.920><c> guess</c><06:11:09.718><c> um</c><06:11:10.080><c> thank</c><06:11:10.280><c> you</c><06:11:10.600><c> that</c>

06:11:10.830 --> 06:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
I'll continue I guess um thank you that
 

06:11:10.840 --> 06:11:14.548 align:start position:0%
I'll continue I guess um thank you that
that<06:11:11.040><c> helps</c><06:11:11.320><c> a</c><06:11:11.440><c> lot</c><06:11:12.040><c> um</c><06:11:12.440><c> so</c><06:11:13.360><c> is</c><06:11:13.478><c> it</c><06:11:14.160><c> your</c>

06:11:14.548 --> 06:11:14.558 align:start position:0%
that helps a lot um so is it your

06:11:20.830 --> 06:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
clean up that conflict or that this

clean up that conflict or that this

it would be a fairly significant rewrite
 

06:11:30.240 --> 06:11:33.150 align:start position:0%
it would be a fairly significant rewrite

06:19:07.270 --> 06:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
see whether that continues but last
