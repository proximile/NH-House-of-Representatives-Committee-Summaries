Education to issue
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
subpoenas um and I I guess I would say
 
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
on this that um you may recall we had um
 
00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:53.839 align:start position:0%
the the issue of the Department of
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
Education having subpoena power was uh
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
came up in connection with a bill uh
 
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.030 align:start position:0%
last year
um

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:08.519 align:start position:0%
this uh this bill represents the product
 
00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:11.550 align:start position:0%
this uh this bill represents the product
of

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
uh as I understand it and I want I want
 
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
to emphasize this this bill although I
 
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
am the prime sponsor this bill and the
 
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
details of it represent the product of
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
what I understand to be discussions
 
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
between representative kutab who was
 
00:12:29.629 --> 00:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
primarily respons responsible for the
 
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
details of the Drafting and discussions
 
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
she had with uh representatives of the
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
Education um and and I and I believe
 
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
some other Representatives on this
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
committee although I'm not positive
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
about that um and I so I think that as I
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
understand one of the concerns last year
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
was that the subpoena power was too
 
00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
broad and there was a
 
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
concern um of potential
 
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
abuse um I think that the the way it is
 
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
worded now as I understand it is the is
 
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
what representative uh kutab did was to
 
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
speak with the Department of Education
 
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
and in particular the
 
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
investigator um and maybe the attorney
 
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
for the Department as to what were the
 
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
specific uh types of Investigations that
 
00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
they did involving teacher credentialing
 
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
of know uh uh or violations by a teacher
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
uh that would that would result in loss
 
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
of credentialing or potential loss of
 
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
credentialing um that should be the sub
 
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:43.240 align:start position:0%
subject of subpoenas and that is what is
 
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
reflected um in the bill um so I hope
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
that that will um address um the the
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
concerns uh that that were uh uh
 
00:13:59.790 --> 00:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
discussed about potential uh over breath
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
of of the uh of the subpoena power um it
 
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
I guess what I would say is the the only
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
other point I would make is one of the
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
things we heard I think as I recall from
 
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
the testimony last year was
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
that the way things stand
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
now there can be situations where the
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
receives um information indicating some
 
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
that a a uh teacher for example has
 
00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
committed some violation of
 
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
uh rules or regulations including you
 
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
know potentially very serious ones that
 
00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
even could amount to uh in some
 
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances could amount to criminal
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
conduct or or subject the school
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
district to liability or something like
 
00:14:51.069 --> 00:14:51.079 align:start position:0%
that um and when the Department of
 
00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
Education goes to investigate that um
 
00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
they have no often there will be
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
resistance on the part of the school
 
00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:02.959 align:start position:0%
district and the department has no uh no
 
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
authority to compel that they basically
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
can the school district can sort of say
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
go pound sand and there's not really
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
very much that the uh that the
 
00:15:13.949 --> 00:15:13.959 align:start position:0%
Department of Education can do that you
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
know whether it seems to me that that
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
should not be the law and it shouldn't
 
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
be the law for the Department of
 
00:15:21.749 --> 00:15:21.759 align:start position:0%
Education or any other department if
 
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
authority uh to uh to
 
00:15:29.069 --> 00:15:29.079 align:start position:0%
investigate uh to if they have a to
 
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
regulate and investigate and they have
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
authority to conduct hearings um and
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
impose discipline then it seems to me
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
they ought it it should not be the law
 
00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
that somebody can just say you know go
 
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
pound sand um so that's that's why I
 
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:49.240 align:start position:0%
think this is uh this is appropriate I'm
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
00:15:51.199 --> 00:15:52.430 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
representative

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair do you want to
 
00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
answer questions rather than I mean if
 
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
you want to I happy to ask the questions
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
well no sure I mean my my sense was that
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
that since I you know since I've now
 
00:16:08.309 --> 00:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
testified that I would not be answer be
 
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
be asking any questions once I you know
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
step out of this seat okay well of
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
course as you know you don't have to
 
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
answer any questions I asked and it
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
might be more appropriate for someone
 
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
else um I I was interested to hear your
 
00:16:26.749 --> 00:16:26.759 align:start position:0%
summary of what happened last year be I
 
00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:29.959 align:start position:0%
I pulled out my notes uh of last year's
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
Bill and they differ somewhat from from
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
your presentation in that the gentleman
 
00:16:40.509 --> 00:16:40.519 align:start position:0%
and I apologize because I've forgotten
 
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
his name who was the chief
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
investigator indicated very clearly that
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
he didn't have any problems he was
 
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
concerned that there might be problems
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
in the future and therefore that was why
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
he was asking that he in fact had not
 
00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:04.039 align:start position:0%
had any interference and so perhaps
 
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
someone else could correct me on that
 
00:17:11.309 --> 00:17:11.319 align:start position:0%
but when i' I've looked at the bill and
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
I know how hard our colleague worked on
 
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
this and I looked at the material that
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
was prepared for this committee which
 
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:25.079 align:start position:0%
lists the subpoena power of all the of
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
any other agency where there is subpoena
 
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.230 align:start position:0%
any other agency where there is subpoena
power

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
power
 
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
and as you know I'm not a lawyer but
 
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
when I look at this in every case that I
 
00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:40.919 align:start position:0%
see um it is a case where there is a
 
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
formal hearing where there has been a
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
charge and there is a formal hearing and
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
case there you know they have the power
 
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
to subpoena Witnesses they don't have
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
the power to subpoena Witnesses unless
 
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:01.799 align:start position:0%
on Miss reading all of this
 
00:18:01.799 --> 00:18:03.909 align:start position:0%
on Miss reading all of this
to

00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:03.919 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
initiate a search or an investigation
 
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
the power of subpoena which is very very
 
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
important is only when there has been a
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
charge and there is a hearing and I
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
don't see anything in this that
 
00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
indicat that would apply in this
 
00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:29.559 align:start position:0%
situation this seems to be much more of
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
a preliminary search effort and can you
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
help me
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
understand where tell me where I'm
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
wrong sure well first on on your first
 
00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:44.590 align:start position:0%
wrong sure well first on on your first
point

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
um my re you know I my recollection was
 
00:18:51.789 --> 00:18:51.799 align:start position:0%
that I thought that the that the um that
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
the uh investigator did say I mean I I I
 
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
do remember him saying that
 
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
most of the time at least that's what I
 
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
thought he said most of the time he you
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
know that this has not been a problem
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
but I thought he did say that there were
 
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
there were some occasions when there was
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
now I could be wrong that it was about
 
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
it being him maybe it was someone else
 
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:16.039 align:start position:0%
that said that but I do
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
recall there being some evidence that
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
there were that you know of of a lack of
 
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
cooperation and not being able to do
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
anything about it I thought it was from
 
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:27.400 align:start position:0%
the investigator but I could be wrong on
 
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
that it might have been some it might
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
have been someone else is the is is the
 
00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
investigator in the room by any
 
00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:36.039 align:start position:0%
chance I don't yeah I don't I don't I
 
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
don't know I don't know and I don't and
 
00:19:39.549 --> 00:19:39.559 align:start position:0%
I have to say I don't remember I don't
 
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
remember his name either I do do
 
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
remember he was
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
a oh okay far okay yep I know I remember
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
I do remember he was a retired state
 
00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
trooper I believe but uh um and on the
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
on the other uh issue I guess I would
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
say I guess I would say
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
this if I have haven't looked at the
 
00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
subpoena power of the other agencies
 
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
recently but if it's true and I accept
 
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:08.200 align:start position:0%
what you I accept what you say it it
 
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
seems to me that that's a problem for if
 
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
if if the other agency subpoena powers
 
00:20:16.669 --> 00:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
are limited in that fashion they
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be in other words it seems it
 
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
seems to me that if you are an if you
 
00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
are an agency that has the power to
 
00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
investigate and to conduct hearings you
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
it it shouldn't be the case that
 
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
regulated individuals can simply say
 
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm not cooperating that again I I
 
00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:41.559 align:start position:0%
have to emphasize
 
00:20:41.559 --> 00:20:43.270 align:start position:0%
have to emphasize
here

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:20:45.789 --> 00:20:45.799 align:start position:0%
subpoenas are not search
 
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
warrants if the if if if you give the
 
00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
power to this agency or the Department
 
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services or the
 
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor if you give them the
 
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
authority to issue penis it doesn't mean
 
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
that they can you know run over to some
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
school district for example and just
 
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
grab the records they have to send they
 
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
send a subpoena saying produce these
 
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
records the school district if they
 
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
think there's this is in bad faith or
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
there's something wrong with that they
 
00:21:20.909 --> 00:21:20.919 align:start position:0%
can say no I'm not going to I'm not
 
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
going to comply with that subpoena and
 
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
then this they to enforce the subpoena
 
00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:28.360 align:start position:0%
the school district uh the department of
 
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
Education would have to go to court they
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
can't this isn't as I say this isn't
 
00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:33.559 align:start position:0%
like a search warrant that they just
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
come in and see stuff they they make
 
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
this formal request the the school
 
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
district responds uh either by either by
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
moving to I suppose they the school
 
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
district I suppose could go to court
 
00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:48.919 align:start position:0%
initially and move to quash The subpoena
 
00:21:50.269 --> 00:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
but if they didn't do that and they
 
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
simply didn't answer then the next step
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Education would be
 
00:21:57.669 --> 00:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
to go to court to enforce it so this is
 
00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%
you know and I guess what I would say is
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
if the if there are other agencies that
 
00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:04.919 align:start position:0%
don't have that power but have similar
 
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
investigative responsibility I think
 
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
they should have that power I we will be
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
able to talk about it I know there are
 
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
other people who want to ask questions
 
00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:16.039 align:start position:0%
and other people who were here the only
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
point that I want to make is that the
 
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
other agencies are able to get the
 
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
information that they want collect it
 
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
decide that there is a reason that there
 
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
is a problem and then hold a hearing
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
with the an appropriate person and uh uh
 
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
conducting that hearing and at that
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
point they have subpoena power the
 
00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
question is how early in the process if
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
someone wakes up in the morning and says
 
00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:46.039 align:start position:0%
gee I wonder what's happening I don't
 
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
think that's enough for you know
 
00:22:50.269 --> 00:22:50.279 align:start position:0%
subpoena but I I'm conscious of taking
 
00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
too much time this morning so I'm going
 
00:22:54.669 --> 00:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
to stop now and I hope perhaps we can
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
continue the
 
00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
discussion representative organ um yes
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Vice acting chair
 
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
question um this um seems like it's
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
limited only to Educators as defined by
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
something in RSA 219a to dou C1 and that
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
refers to a code of contract for
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
licensed and certified Educators so is
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
this intended only to investigate uh
 
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
illegal or otherwise questionable
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
activity by licens and certified
 
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
education Personnel or is
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
or would the intent be to cover opinion
 
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
by like other people in the school
 
00:23:35.549 --> 00:23:35.559 align:start position:0%
Community because there are like uh you
 
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
know non educational Personnel who may
 
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
be doing these terrible things I suppose
 
00:23:42.029 --> 00:23:42.039 align:start position:0%
even students might be doing these
 
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
terrible things in the school setting so
 
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
why is this uh is that by Design or is
 
00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
that why is that is that limited only to
 
00:23:52.029 --> 00:23:52.039 align:start position:0%
Educators and if so should it be made
 
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's the intent of the bill
 
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
yeah sure so I I think the answer to
 
00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
your question is yes in other words as I
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
understand and that the the whole the
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
whole rationale for this is that the
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has the
 
00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559 align:start position:0%
authority to regulate teachers and
 
00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:11.720 align:start position:0%
regulate their licensing and you know
 
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
suspend them or whatever and so it's and
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
hold hearings for the purpose of doing
 
00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
that and so I think it is limited to
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
regulated regulated Personnel for lack
 
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
of a better term which I think would
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
include would include teachers I mean
 
00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:28.630 align:start position:0%
include would include teachers I mean
maybe

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know School nurses but School
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
nurses probably are more regulated by
 
00:24:35.549 --> 00:24:35.559 align:start position:0%
you know the healthc care I uh I don't
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
know whether they whether they would
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
fall within the school regulatory
 
00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
Authority also if they do then I guess
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
maybe that they would be
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
covered and another omission and maybe
 
00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
this simply because we don't
 
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
particularly have a state law governing
 
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
that is about weapons in school if a
 
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
educator is you know carrying a weapon
 
00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
without authorization from the school or
 
00:24:59.230 --> 00:24:59.240 align:start position:0%
under questionable circumstances so is
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
that uh was that admitted because
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
there's no state law even though that
 
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
can be a violation of federal law and
 
00:25:06.029 --> 00:25:06.039 align:start position:0%
they could be violating you know state
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
laws other than our non-existent
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
gun-free School law but and if there was
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
such a law we'd be hearing that and that
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
be across the road in education anyway
 
00:25:18.269 --> 00:25:18.279 align:start position:0%
so is that is that a so is that like a a
 
00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:20.200 align:start position:0%
deliberate deliberate Omission or is
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
that just uh this just because this bill
 
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:24.200 align:start position:0%
can't cover everything that can happen
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
in the school setting and it got left
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
out I
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
I mean I I'm
 
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
not I'm not sure that I'm not sure that
 
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
but are you saying if some if if if it
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
was a violation of school policy for a
 
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
teacher for example to be carrying a
 
00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:46.360 align:start position:0%
weapon uh and that and that constituted
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
a violation of some Department of
 
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
Education regulation
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
um I don't know whether that would fall
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
within any of these uh let me take a
 
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
quick look
 
00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.909 align:start position:0%
quick look
here

00:26:02.909 --> 00:26:02.919 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
uh probably could be I mean certainly
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
they could be using it to assault
 
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
righty well I I mean I suppose you know
 
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
um any act any alleged Act of
 
00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
endangerment or cruelty I mean maybe
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
that you know arguably that falls within
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
that so
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
sure thanks thanks representative Manos
 
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:37.240 align:start position:0%
my question in the absence of this bill
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
would the Attorney General be authorized
 
00:26:41.909 --> 00:26:41.919 align:start position:0%
to issue subpoenas on behalf of the
 
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
Education I I don't think so um I mean
 
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
you know in other words if the Attorney
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
General went to court if the attorney
 
00:26:55.789 --> 00:26:55.799 align:start position:0%
general actually uh uh initiated a
 
00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
lawsuit of some type that then I think
 
00:26:59.630 --> 00:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
surely surely they could issue a
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
subpoena just you know like in
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
connection with anyone else that that
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
that is in court but I don't think
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
because and what leaves me to say that
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
is there the Attorney General I think
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
does not have sort of
 
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
General um subpoena power in fact I
 
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
think don't we
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
have um somebody I think has a bill
 
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:28.120 align:start position:0%
about um giving the Attorney General
 
00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.789 --> 00:27:35.799 align:start position:0%
for civil rights I think that's right I
 
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
think isn't there a bill that I think we
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
may have it that that purporting to give
 
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:41.480 align:start position:0%
the attorney or which seeks to give the
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
Attorney General subpoena power for
 
00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:44.990 align:start position:0%
Attorney General subpoena power for
civil

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
civil
 
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
rights um
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
cases uh because he doesn't have that
 
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
now and I I think if I recall correctly
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
from speaking with the Attorney
 
00:27:57.549 --> 00:27:57.559 align:start position:0%
General's office about that the only
 
00:27:59.549 --> 00:27:59.559 align:start position:0%
only subpoena power that they have right
 
00:28:01.389 --> 00:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
now is in connection with charitable
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
trusts and consumer
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
protection um they don't have and in
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
fact I I I remember speaking with uh
 
00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
attorney Assistant Attorney General lock
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh when there was a when you know he
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
sent me an email or something about the
 
00:28:19.149 --> 00:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
bill basically saying you know why I I
 
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with with your having
 
00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:23.240 align:start position:0%
subena power for civil rights cases but
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
we really should have General subpoena
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
power why why shouldn't you the Attorney
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
General why shouldn't you have General
 
00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.870 align:start position:0%
General why shouldn't you have General
subpoena

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:35.909 --> 00:28:35.919 align:start position:0%
power any other questions for this
 
00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:38.039 align:start position:0%
witness representative
 
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
Stapleton thank you thank you for taking
 
00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
my question um on page page
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
one Roman 13
 
00:28:53.389 --> 00:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
line3 um I think that paragraph answers
 
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
several of the questions that have been
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
posed issuing subpoenas for for persons
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
and for the production of documents
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
tangible objects and other items and
 
00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:06.919 align:start position:0%
things whenever the co commissioner has
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
reason to believe that a violation of
 
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct for New Hampshire
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
Educators is established in RSA 21-9
 
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
colon9 and so far has
 
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
occurred um in the case
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
of the teacher with the
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
weapon um
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
is that in the code of conduct or not
 
00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
and if it's not in the code of conduct
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
then it has to fall into
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
another Authority or venue for that
 
00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:42.039 align:start position:0%
problem that I mean that's what I would
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
I mean you know
 
00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.870 align:start position:0%
I mean you know
arguably

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
arguably
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
could without getting into the whole you
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
know gun control issue about whether or
 
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
not those these gun free school zones
 
00:30:00.269 --> 00:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
actually do anything assuming that they
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
do I suppose someone could argue that
 
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
any alleged Act of endangerment or Co or
 
00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:08.519 align:start position:0%
cruelty uh this I suppose this could
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
involve an act of endangerment um I
 
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
suppose I'm not sure that I would uh I
 
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
say I'm not sure that philosophically I
 
00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
would think that that's true but uh um
 
00:30:21.509 --> 00:30:21.519 align:start position:0%
we don't know what's in the code of
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
conduct right we don't yeah and that may
 
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
be a evolving document as time goes on
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
we follow up yes um is this subpoena
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
really not a um a tool of Discovery
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
after which then hearings and process
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
can ensue oh no absolutely that's that's
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
exactly what it is it's a it's a it
 
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
basically is is designed to ensure that
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
the um that the Department of
 
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
Education has the ability to if if it if
 
00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
it has investigative Authority that it
 
00:30:59.669 --> 00:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
has the ability to to compel people to
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
you know to cooperate essentially that's
 
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's what it's designed to
 
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.669 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's what it's designed to
do

00:31:06.669 --> 00:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:09.919 align:start position:0%
followup another question I had was on
 
00:31:09.919 --> 00:31:11.149 align:start position:0%
followup another question I had was on
page

00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
two um relative to service at line 11
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
and sub five a service uh shall be made
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
on persons who are not lenses or
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
certified individuals in accordance with
 
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
the procedures and fee schedules of the
 
00:31:29.509 --> 00:31:29.519 align:start position:0%
Superior Court
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
Etc um is that just a guideline in how
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
to be served or do they have to actually
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
run that through the court for that
 
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
class of persons no I I I they they do
 
00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:44.679 align:start position:0%
not have it's just that's just by
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
analogy in other words they they don't
 
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
have to go through they don't have to go
 
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
to court first um but they do have to
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
you know follow the same sort of
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
procedures yes thank
 
00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:57.320 align:start position:0%

Hawkins thank you Mr chairman members of
 
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
the House Judiciary Committee for the
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
record my name is Megan Tuttle president
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
of Nea New Hampshire representing about
 
00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
17,000 Educators across the state and I
 
00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
have Brian Hawkins with me who's the
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
government relations director for NAA
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm here today to express
 
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
our opposition to House Bill 1353
 
00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:44.039 align:start position:0%
relative to authorizing the commissioner
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
of Education to issue
 
00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
subpoenas we contend that the language
 
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 1353 is too broad
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
fundamentally unfair and inconsistent
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
with other New Hampshire licensing
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
agency and court procedures the first
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
question question this committee should
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
answer before examining the language of
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
this bill ought to be is it necessary
 
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
for the commissioner of Education to
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
have subpoena power to properly carry
 
00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
out his charge under the New Hampshire
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
educator code of conduct in the public
 
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
hearing on the non- gerain amendment
 
00:33:15.149 --> 00:33:15.159 align:start position:0%
last year the department staff indicated
 
00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
that it was not currently necessary and
 
00:33:19.389 --> 00:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
that this Authority was a prospective
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
need if there were documents that a
 
00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
school district would simply not allow
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
them access to this question of whether
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
there were documents not being made made
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
available to them was asked both in a
 
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
subsequent retained Bill subcommittee
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
meeting and in follow-up conversations
 
00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
had with the doe and their answer
 
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
continued to be no there were not
 
00:33:40.269 --> 00:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
documents that the doe could not view in
 
00:33:42.029 --> 00:33:42.039 align:start position:0%
determining whether to recommend whether
 
00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:43.720 align:start position:0%
a violation had occurred and a
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
disciplinary sanction warranted unless
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
something is changed we submit that
 
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
subpoena Authority the commissioner
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
seeking is
 
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
unnecessary House Bill 1353 is written
 
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
is too broad it does not give the doe
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
authority to issue subpoenas for all
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
alleged violations of the code of
 
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
conduct most of the included categories
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
in the bill which are meant to narrow
 
00:34:05.789 --> 00:34:05.799 align:start position:0%
the types of alleged violations have to
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
do with student safety but House Bill
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
1353 includes the authority to issue
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
subpoenas for alleged failure to provide
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate supervision pursuant to
 
00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:19.720 align:start position:0%
local Schoolboard policy we have concern
 
00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:21.560 align:start position:0%
over the inclusion of this because the
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
way the doe has applied this rule when
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
justifying the opening of of an
 
00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
investigation not providing appropriate
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
supervision sounds like it's related to
 
00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
student injuries from a recklessly
 
00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
supervised science lab experiment or
 
00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
something like that but the doe often
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
uses this provision to investigate
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
curriculum or classroom materials or
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
speech in classrooms category 9 in the
 
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
bill has essentially been used as a
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
catch-all for anything that doesn't fit
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
anywhere else in the code of conduct but
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has wanted something
 
00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:51.349 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has wanted something
looked

00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
looked
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
into as written We Believe House Bill
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
1353 is fundamentally unfair specific
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
Ally under the due process clause of the
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
14th Amendment the government is
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
prohibited from taking adverse actions
 
00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:04.839 align:start position:0%
against license holders without
 
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
providing due process at its most basic
 
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
level the requirement to afford due
 
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
process forbids the government from
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
denying or thwarting claims of statutory
 
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:15.640 align:start position:0%
entitlement by a procedure that's
 
00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:16.990 align:start position:0%
entitlement by a procedure that's
fundamentally

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
fundamentally
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
unfair and or add to that the New
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court has held that
 
00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
the ultimate standard for judging a due
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
process claim is the notion of
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
fundamental fairness ruling that
 
00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839 align:start position:0%
fundamental fairness requires a
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
government conduct conform conduct
 
00:35:32.829 --> 00:35:32.839 align:start position:0%
conformed to the community sense of
 
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
justice decency and fair play clearly
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
that's not happening under this the doe
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
is asking for the ability to issue
 
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
subpoenas to solicit information during
 
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
investigations yet there are no
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
Provisions that the subject educator may
 
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
also issue subpoenas which would assist
 
00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
in their defense during the
 
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
investigation period or a judicatory
 
00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
hearing phase Educators should be
 
00:35:57.069 --> 00:35:57.079 align:start position:0%
granted the ability to subpoena Witness
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
and documents in their own defense I
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
hope we can all agree that proceedings
 
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
such as this should be fair House Bill
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
1353 is not consistent with other
 
00:36:09.069 --> 00:36:09.079 align:start position:0%
agencies or Court subpoena procedure
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
agency regulations relating to subpoenas
 
00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
are not uniform however they have
 
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:15.880 align:start position:0%
consistency in having subpoenas as part
 
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
of the adjudicatory um process not
 
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:21.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily the investigation part it's
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
also consistent in other agency rules
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
that both sides are allowed to both
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
request subpoenas and move to quash
 
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
subpoenas this bill only proposes
 
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
subpoenas for the commissioner to issue
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
during the investigation phase and there
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
is no quashing process and I have some
 
00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:38.079 align:start position:0%
examples in written testimony that will
 
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
turn in both sides having the ability to
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
utilize The subpoena power would be an
 
00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
actual Fair process the bill should be
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
amended so both parties can request and
 
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.589 align:start position:0%
amended so both parties can request and
quash

00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
quash
 
00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
subpoenas we heard last year from the
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
Department staff who testified that
 
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
subpoena power is something the office
 
00:36:58.309 --> 00:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
of professional licenser opl C has but
 
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
how and in what phase that power seems
 
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
to vary it seems prudent that this
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
committee seek that information from the
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
oplc themselves rather than from another
 
00:37:09.309 --> 00:37:09.319 align:start position:0%
agency my written testimony also has
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
some observation examples of this other
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
boards don't have subpoena powers during
 
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
the investigation phase only the hearing
 
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
phase the naturopathic Board of exam uh
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
examiners is one such board additionally
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
anyone served with a subpoena in a court
 
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
action or in these other agencies can
 
00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
move to The subpoena on various grounds
 
00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:30.040 align:start position:0%
that should be available in doe
 
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:32.680 align:start position:0%
proceedings just as is in other agency
 
00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
procedures House Bill 1353 is a
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
continuation of an overreach of
 
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
authority that the doe has been seeking
 
00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
since the Inception of this bill last
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
year while we do not agree that this
 
00:37:44.589 --> 00:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
Authority is necessary even if we did
 
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
this bill is not written sufficiently to
 
00:37:48.309 --> 00:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
ensure a fair process or the necessary
 
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
safeguards to prevent abuse we urge this
 
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
committee to find House Bill 1353 an
 
00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and urge the doe
 
00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
to work with stakeholders to better
 
00:37:58.990 --> 00:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
identify the challenge it's seeking to
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
fix and explore the possible solutions
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
than beginning with the suben authority
 
00:38:04.829 --> 00:38:04.839 align:start position:0%
it's looking to acquire and there is
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
written testimony with more um that we
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
will turn in and we're happy to take
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you thanks for taking my
 
00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
question it's my understanding that an
 
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:21.640 align:start position:0%
educator is credentialed once in their
 
00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
career um so I could graduate from
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
college and to work at age 25 and be
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
credentialed and have a background check
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
done and perhaps the school district
 
00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
that I went to work at did a background
 
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
check and I could work for 40 years with
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
never having to have another background
 
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
check and never to have to be
 
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
credentialed is that correct thank you
 
00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
for the question um as far as I know
 
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
with the background checks yes there
 
00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
have been other bills introduced to have
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
talking about now okay then yes but I
 
00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
will add for the credentialing pieces
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
that you asked about you do get
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
credentialed once but you do have to go
 
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
through a recertification process every
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
3 years and through that recertification
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
process you have to have professional
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
development hours your principal your
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
superintendent has to sign off on it and
 
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
then that goes through the Department of
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
Education to allow your certification
 
00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
for another three years and when you go
 
00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:15.880 align:start position:0%
through that credential EMP power I know
 
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
when I was a nurse I had to renew my
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
license every two years and I had to
 
00:39:23.309 --> 00:39:23.319 align:start position:0%
have so many CEUs but I also had to
 
00:39:26.109 --> 00:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
certify under penalty of prosecution or
 
00:39:26.119 --> 00:39:27.109 align:start position:0%
certify under penalty of prosecution or
law

00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
that I had not been arrested or anything
 
00:39:34.589 --> 00:39:34.599 align:start position:0%
for any type of any type of minor or
 
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
major crime I'm sure that is still the
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
case as part of their ongoing
 
00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
education do uh Educators also have to
 
00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
sign an affidavit saying they have not
 
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
been arrested or uh charged with or
 
00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
whatever any
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
crime any
 
00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
crime uh I believe excuse me thank you
 
00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
uh there's a duty under the code of
 
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
conduct to report no that's not what I'm
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
asking I'm asking as part of their every
 
00:40:09.119 --> 00:40:10.150 align:start position:0%
asking I'm asking as part of their every
threeyear

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
threeyear
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
process that you just said that they had
 
00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
do they have to sign an affidavit saying
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
under the penalty of perjury or whatever
 
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not a
 
00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
lawyer that they have not been charged
 
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
or arrested or convicted of any type of
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
criminal activity yes or it's a yes or
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
no I think we' have we'd have to get
 
00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:37.480 align:start position:0%
back to you on that um I would just
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
continue to submit though that um under
 
00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct there is a duty to
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh disclose um uh under under the code
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
of conduct I understand that's a duty
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
yeah but if I'm an educator and I'm at
 
00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
the summer in Hawaii and I get arrested
 
00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.309 align:start position:0%
the summer in Hawaii and I get arrested
for

00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
ddii there's nothing that forces me to
 
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
come back to the to the doe and say I
 
00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
got arrested for DUI correct so I'm I'm
 
00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
not sure how that's relevant to this
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
bill this bill is about subpoena power
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
right it it does have it does so I'm
 
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
just saying that I can work for 40 years
 
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
never have to sign an affidavit that
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
I've never done anything wrong and be
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
credential continue to be credential in
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
anything I don't know represent is there
 
00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
a question there yes I if you know of
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
professional agency or profession that
 
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.910 align:start position:0%
professional agency or profession that
allows

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:37.309 --> 00:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm sorry that allow Mr
 
00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
chairman that allows I'm not sure I
 
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
understand the question that allows
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
what any further questions
 
00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.030 align:start position:0%
what any further questions
representative

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:51.160 align:start position:0%
Kat thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so I guess I I do
 
00:41:56.829 --> 00:41:56.839 align:start position:0%
want to ask you made comment about there
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
not really being another area where
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
subpoenas are issued in this manner and
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
I just I wanted to ask under RSA 168 C
 
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
16-a which allows
 
00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:12.839 align:start position:0%
for hearing officers at the doe to issue
 
00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
subpoenas under special
 
00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.630 align:start position:0%
subpoenas under special
education

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
um impartial due process
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
appeals are you finding that that is
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
currently being abused because that is a
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
current Authority that that is
 
00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
allowed I I I think our testimony wasn't
 
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
that there aren't subpoenas allowed in
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
other areas of state government it is
 
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
that this bill as it's written is not
 
00:42:44.109 --> 00:42:44.119 align:start position:0%
consistent with those um in that if you
 
00:42:48.549 --> 00:42:48.559 align:start position:0%
look at some of uh examples like in oplc
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
and others there are Provisions around
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
as we testified earlier um uh things
 
00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
like I mean in this bill there's nothing
 
00:42:59.710 --> 00:42:59.720 align:start position:0%
that uh restricts the subpoenas to be
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
relevant to the uh to the uh
 
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
investigation that's happening I don't
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
see that I don't see uh as uh president
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
tutle testified to earlier anything
 
00:43:15.069 --> 00:43:15.079 align:start position:0%
relative to um quashing subpoenas um and
 
00:43:15.079 --> 00:43:16.309 align:start position:0%
relative to um quashing subpoenas um and
then

00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
also uh
 
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
in um I think when you look when you
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
look at uh what are these other agencies
 
00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:29.720 align:start position:0%
you also have variations as to whether
 
00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:31.400 align:start position:0%
you are allowing subpoenas during an
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
investigatory phase and an adjudicatory
 
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
phase so I don't think we were saying
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
that uh they're not allowed in other uh
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
areas of
 
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
law may follow up followup yes so I I
 
00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
mean in here I'm seeing that it is it's
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
when there's reason to believe that a
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
violation has occurred and that it's
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's offering specific things and when
 
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at this other one that I
 
00:43:57.390 --> 00:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
just referen I don't see anything in
 
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
here about quashing Powers um but I mean
 
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
I guess my other question really is that
 
00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
you mentioned on the one hand that you
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
felt that it was too broad but then on
 
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
the other hand you kind
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
of implied that it was too narrow
 
00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
because you said that it doesn't allow
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
for all areas of conduct to be
 
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
investigated so is it that it's too
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
broad or is it that it's too narrow
 
00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think
 
00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
that's a good one so uh I think the uh
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
the statement about um not allowing all
 
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:31.720 align:start position:0%
um areas of the code of conduct and we
 
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
do highlight the corresponding code of
 
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
conduct uh Provisions that we think are
 
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
are parallel to this bill um
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
that uh that was an that was more of an
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
observation of the bill but what we're
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
saying is there are there are parts of
 
00:44:52.829 --> 00:44:52.839 align:start position:0%
that bill including as we referenced
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
number nine that we think would po would
 
00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
uh take take this too broad um and so
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
you know if you're are contemplating
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
this that we feel like that ought to
 
00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:07.240 align:start position:0%
either be stricken or or uh
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
further follow up would would you be
 
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
more comfortable if instead of the
 
00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:21.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner of ad if this was a hearing
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
officer that was able to to issue the
 
00:45:26.589 --> 00:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
the subpoenas
 
00:45:28.349 --> 00:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
I I think that would be I think that
 
00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:31.640 align:start position:0%
would fall more consistent because you
 
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
have an independent third party that is
 
00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
providing some guard rail to both sides
 
00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
you know as to whether uh subpoena is
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate um so uh I hope that answers
 
00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.630 align:start position:0%
appropriate um so uh I hope that answers
your

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
question it it does I think it sounds
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
like that you're maybe you're willing to
 
00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:53.839 align:start position:0%
work through on something with
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
this you know we are always willing to
 
00:45:58.589 --> 00:45:58.599 align:start position:0%
work on these things you know one of the
 
00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
things that uh we're very proud of on
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
other pieces of legislation that we have
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh uh testified on is
 
00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
that um you know we have offered
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
suggestions on other pieces of
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
legislation having to do with a variety
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
of issues related to either the code of
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
conduct or safety or background checks
 
00:46:22.349 --> 00:46:22.359 align:start position:0%
um as well as uh you know there's the
 
00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
committee should also be aware that the
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
doe is undertaking a Ru making uh
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
revising the code of conduct
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
investigatory process currently um and
 
00:46:35.549 --> 00:46:35.559 align:start position:0%
we uh have offered um what we what at
 
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
least in our view is productive
 
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
suggestions on how to improve those um

00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
first time before the Judiciary
 
00:47:26.829 --> 00:47:26.839 align:start position:0%
Committee thank you Mr chairman um I'm
 
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
here to support 13353 for subpoena power
 
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire doe
 
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
um first I would like to point out that
 
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
the state gets millions of dollars to be
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
the enforcement arm of the federal doe
 
00:47:40.589 --> 00:47:40.599 align:start position:0%
and they're supposed to conduct
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
investigations um and that's why they
 
00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
exist in part um I had a teacher from my
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
son's school who had been through four
 
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
schools in three years um if you looked
 
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
at the newspaper articles about the
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
person he'd been doing some things that
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
were not appropriate um but there was no
 
00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
investigation of him and he continued to
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
move from school to school doing the
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
same activity there were no real
 
00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
background checks done on anyone who
 
00:48:08.549 --> 00:48:08.559 align:start position:0%
gets put into a school um when they move
 
00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
from school to school there's a lot of
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
embezzlement happening my son attended
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
school in Manchester we had people
 
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
stealing from the boosters and people
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
stealing cards um which would be a code
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
of conduct violation which was never
 
00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
investigated um my I myself reported the
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
school for Ida
 
00:48:31.069 --> 00:48:31.079 align:start position:0%
violations um and there was supposed to
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
be an idea investigation of the school
 
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
due to numerous complaints and the
 
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:37.640 align:start position:0%
school refused to allow the New
 
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doe to look at the files now
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
violations of idea would be obviously a
 
00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
civil rights violation which never got
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
investigated and never got
 
00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:51.160 align:start position:0%
corrected um all of these factors put
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
Children at Risk I would like to point
 
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
out that DHHS has subpoena power and
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
they don't have to have a hearing and
 
00:48:59.870 --> 00:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
that's because we This Is Us dealing
 
00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
with children and children who are being
 
00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
harmed need immediate
 
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
intervention um I also attended a
 
00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
hearing with the Rochester school
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
district as an in the audience where the
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
Rochester school district said they had
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
they admitted to doing the violations
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
and they were given a self monitoring
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
corrective action self-monitoring so I
 
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
don't know how many people drive on i93
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
and see people going 80 90 mph they're
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
not following the 65 mph speed limit and
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
if a police officer told them to just
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
monitor their speed and turn themselves
 
00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
in when they were speeding would they
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
really do that I have to ask that
 
00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
because right now we have
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
self-monitoring for our schools and I
 
00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:44.079 align:start position:0%
don't think that's
 
00:49:44.079 --> 00:49:48.630 align:start position:0%
don't think that's
appropriate

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
um I'd also like to point out that
 
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
criminal proceedings have a much higher
 
00:49:59.150 --> 00:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
um I'd also like to point out that in
 
00:50:04.109 --> 00:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
the city of conquered hoe young abused
 
00:50:06.309 --> 00:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
students for many years he started
 
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:07.640 align:start position:0%
abusing them in middle school and
 
00:50:09.309 --> 00:50:09.319 align:start position:0%
continued to abuse them through high
 
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
school and that he was never stopped
 
00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
from doing so where were the teachers
 
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
who were supposed to report his behavior
 
00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
because he was openly engaging in sexual
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
behavior with dead students in the
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:27.150 align:start position:0%
 
lot

00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
lot
 
00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:30.079 align:start position:0%
after ho Leong was gotten rid of by the
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
school district which was a tenuous
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
process at best because nobody wanted to
 
00:50:36.349 --> 00:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
get rid of him he was charged by the
 
00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts Never by the
 
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire where he was an
 
00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:40.750 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire where he was an
active

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
active
 
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
teacher and two other teachers were
 
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
subsequently let go for similar
 
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
activities so do I think the New
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doe needs subpoena power yes I
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
do are there violations of the code of
 
00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
conduct yes there are is anything done
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
about about it no nothing is done so I
 
00:50:59.910 --> 00:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
am here to support this bill because we
 
00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
have to support kids and we have to make
 
00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
sure that kids are going to school and
 
00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
getting an education
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
and not going through all these other
 
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
things where they're being subject to
 
00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
abuse or other avenues because DHHS will
 
00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:15.640 align:start position:0%
not investigate teachers who abuse
 
00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:18.839 align:start position:0%
because they say that is NHD O's job so
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
I support this bill and I'm happy to
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
take any
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for this Witness
 
00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you we now
 
00:51:47.549 --> 00:51:47.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
Downing the microphone on please sorry
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
good morning chn thank you uh for taking
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
time this morning my name is Christine
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
down I'm the director of curriculum
 
00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
instruction and assessment for three New
 
00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school districts those are
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
planfield Cornish and Gram I'm here
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
because I oppose House Bill
 
00:52:09.069 --> 00:52:09.079 align:start position:0%
1353 in my role as curriculum director
 
00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
I'm often tasked with the responsibility
 
00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:13.880 align:start position:0%
of training all our staff annually on
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
the code of conducts which have been in
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
place since
 
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
2019 um I have provided some materials
 
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
in my written testimony regarding the
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
training around those code of conducts
 
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
um this bill does not provide specific
 
00:52:31.789 --> 00:52:31.799 align:start position:0%
terms in term uh related to the phrase
 
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
reason to believe um I have the
 
00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
questions I would pose to this committee
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
to think about with this bill is has
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
accessing documents and information from
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
districts been an ongoing problem what
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
public data is available to determine
 
00:52:47.309 --> 00:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
what percentage of previous
 
00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:49.640 align:start position:0%
investigations require this type of
 
00:52:52.789 --> 00:52:52.799 align:start position:0%
action is this a a piece of
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
legislation a solution that ser
 
00:52:57.630 --> 00:52:57.640 align:start position:0%
searching for a problem that doesn't
 
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
exist um I also want to uh point out
 
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
that another important aspect um to our
 
00:53:08.589 --> 00:53:08.599 align:start position:0%
entire process in related to due process
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
is the presumption of
 
00:53:12.789 --> 00:53:12.799 align:start position:0%
innocence allowing the commissioner to
 
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
issue subpoenas because he or she has
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
reason to believe without sufficient
 
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
evidence or reasonable cause could lead
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
to unwarranted investigations and damage
 
00:53:26.309 --> 00:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
the reputations of innocent educators
 
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
I also believe that this bill needs to
 
00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:31.480 align:start position:0%
be looked at closely in terms of the
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
checks and balances we have in the three
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
branches of our government many of the
 
00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
violations listed numbers 1 through 12
 
00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
in this bill are covered through State
 
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
statutes that are direct directly
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
related to the duties of law enforcement
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
in court proceedings there are
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
alternative approaches that can be
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
considered besides this bill for example
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
the commissioner could work in
 
00:53:56.829 --> 00:53:56.839 align:start position:0%
collaboration with law enforcement
 
00:53:59.150 --> 00:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
agencies or the State Attorney General
 
00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:01.640 align:start position:0%
office to conduct investigations this
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
would ensure that investigations are
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
conducted within the bounds of the law
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
and PRI provide legal oversight in
 
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
addition a memorandum of understanding
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire education department
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
and school districts regarding
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
communication and information sharing
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
during an investigation might be a
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
better First Step finally it's my
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
understanding that the authority to
 
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
issue a exists for the office of public
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
lure which oversees license holders from
 
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
various professions perhaps the
 
00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:35.240 align:start position:0%
licensing of Educators should be
 
00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:37.720 align:start position:0%
transferred to this office where there's
 
00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
already a process in place consistent
 
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
across all types of Licensing has this
 
00:54:45.789 --> 00:54:45.799 align:start position:0%
option been considered by exploring
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
these alternative approaches I think we
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
can strike a balance between maintaining
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
high standards for educators and
 
00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
safeguarding their rights thank you for
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
your time I am open to
 
00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
kab thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
question number 10 it uh is relative to
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
Illegal Controlled Substances
 
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
um hold on bring up the the
 
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
wrong but oh number six is relative to
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
impairment due to a controlled drug or
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
intoxication four and number five is
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
relative to the possession of a
 
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
controlled drug you said that these were
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
already covered under statute are you
 
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:35.960 align:start position:0%
aware that under RSA 318-b col 2-
 
00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
C Roman numeral 8 that if a teacher were
 
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:43.640 align:start position:0%
to smoke marijuana inside of a school
 
00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:46.119 align:start position:0%
and to be arrested for such under that
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
statute that the doe wouldn't be able to
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
know so that they could potentially do
 
00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
take action with their license because
 
00:55:56.109 --> 00:55:56.119 align:start position:0%
that would be a sealed record
 
00:55:57.870 --> 00:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for informing of that I would
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
also point out that under Ed
 
00:56:04.109 --> 00:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
5101 principle 1 Section B number five
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
possessing using or being under the
 
00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
influence of alcohol or drugs not
 
00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:09.400 align:start position:0%
prescribed for the use of the credential
 
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
holder when on school PR premise or at a
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
school sponsored event where students
 
00:56:16.589 --> 00:56:16.599 align:start position:0%
are present or may reasonably be
 
00:56:20.109 --> 00:56:20.119 align:start position:0%
expected to be present is is the the
 
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
initiation of an investigation against
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
the code of
 
00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:26.510 align:start position:0%
the code of
conduct

00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
understood but they wouldn't be able to
 
00:56:29.789 --> 00:56:29.799 align:start position:0%
get that record without a subpoena
 
00:56:33.029 --> 00:56:33.039 align:start position:0%
because that record is in fact a sealed
 
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:36.200 align:start position:0%
record I I am assuming that's correct I
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
haven't researched that but what I am
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
saying is that if any of this comes to
 
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
light I I would point out that in
 
00:56:44.349 --> 00:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
principle five of the code of conduct
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
which is the duty to report principle
 
00:56:49.069 --> 00:56:49.079 align:start position:0%
it's very clear here that any credential
 
00:56:51.549 --> 00:56:51.559 align:start position:0%
holder shall report any suspected
 
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
violation of the code of conduct
 
00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
following the school uh school district
 
00:56:58.829 --> 00:56:58.839 align:start position:0%
and SAU reporting procedures and failure
 
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
to do that to report um is also um an
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
investigation against the person who
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
failed to report if they're a
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
credentialed holder so I mean I can't
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
speak to that RSA directly I haven't
 
00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
done my research on that but I think
 
00:57:14.589 --> 00:57:14.599 align:start position:0%
there are many checks and balances in
 
00:57:16.829 --> 00:57:16.839 align:start position:0%
place in the current code of conducts
 
00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:19.640 align:start position:0%
that allow people that if if for example
 
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
if I go to a party and I see somebody
 
00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:25.480 align:start position:0%
there engaging in something that is
 
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
questionable especially with students
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
present I have a duty to report that
 
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's not my duty to investigate it but
 
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
it is my duty to report that to my
 
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
supervisors and that's one of the things
 
00:57:39.309 --> 00:57:39.319 align:start position:0%
I train all staff on to make sure that
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
you know we have a checks and balance
 
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
within our profession as well may I
 
00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
follow up one more time I guess my
 
00:57:48.829 --> 00:57:48.839 align:start position:0%
question is is once you report that if
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
they don't have the authority to get the
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
tools to actually prove that this is in
 
00:57:53.799 --> 00:57:57.390 align:start position:0%
tools to actually prove that this is in
fact

00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:59.390 --> 00:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
a an actual founding or an actual
 
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
allegation that that is founded and did
 
00:58:04.829 --> 00:58:04.839 align:start position:0%
take place how are they then supposed to
 
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
actually move forward with their
 
00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
investigation if they don't have the
 
00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
tool that they wouldn't be able to get
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
this documentation because if would you
 
00:58:15.029 --> 00:58:15.039 align:start position:0%
agree then that after you've reported
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
somebody that they should then have this
 
00:58:17.789 --> 00:58:17.799 align:start position:0%
tool or do you think that they should
 
00:58:20.109 --> 00:58:20.119 align:start position:0%
just take your word that they were that
 
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
they were engaging in this activity who
 
00:58:24.109 --> 00:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
I guess representative I need some
 
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
clarification on who you're you're
 
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
referring to when you say they don't
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
have the tool to conduct the
 
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
investigation are you referring to the
 
00:58:35.029 --> 00:58:35.039 align:start position:0%
Department of Education yes well so this
 
00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
is where I still think there are Che
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
checks and balances in the code of
 
00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
conduct and here's what I mean by this
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
so it's clear in this principle 5 and
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
and and this is what I train Educators
 
00:58:47.589 --> 00:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
on is that we all have a duty to report
 
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
right up to the superintendent so here's
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
what's not connecting for me so if the
 
00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is going back to
 
00:58:58.589 --> 00:58:58.599 align:start position:0%
a school district um and as we know the
 
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
chief operate Operating Officer of a
 
00:59:02.589 --> 00:59:02.599 align:start position:0%
school district is the superintendent
 
00:59:04.349 --> 00:59:04.359 align:start position:0%
and requesting information and that
 
00:59:06.549 --> 00:59:06.559 align:start position:0%
superintendent has working knowledge
 
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
that these are possible offenses against
 
00:59:11.549 --> 00:59:11.559 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct then I would loop
 
00:59:13.309 --> 00:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
back to that superintendent is in
 
00:59:16.109 --> 00:59:16.119 align:start position:0%
violation of the code of conduct because
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
if they're not releasing that
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
information when when it's clear that
 
00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct says you have a duty
 
00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:21.750 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct says you have a duty
to

00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
report then I feel that's the tool right
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
there then the department of Ed can
 
00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:27.880 align:start position:0%
certainly take that to the next level
 
00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
under 511 rules in terms of their
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
investigative process so I mean maybe
 
00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:35.960 align:start position:0%
I'm misinterpreting the code of conduct
 
00:59:37.789 --> 00:59:37.799 align:start position:0%
that's been out for the last five years
 
00:59:39.789 --> 00:59:39.799 align:start position:0%
but that's exactly how I train Educators
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
that we all have a duty report and
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
failure to report comes back on all of
 
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
us any further questions for this
 
00:59:52.109 --> 00:59:52.119 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you uh David
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
Trumble you're next please thank thank
 
00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
you did did she excuse me did you um did
 
01:00:00.589 --> 01:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
you have written testimony to submit
 
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
question good morning morning uh thank
 
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and committee members my
 
01:00:29.069 --> 01:00:29.079 align:start position:0%
name is David Trumble I'm from the town
 
01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
of Weare and I oppose this bill the key
 
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
thing about this bill is it's simply a
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
question of subpoena power this bill
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
would create a pathway for executive
 
01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
abuse of such Powers there are three
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
ways that good subpoena powers can be
 
01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
granted in legislation for
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
administrative agencies first question
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
is who can do it can the administrator
 
01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
do it by themselves no there should be a
 
01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
check on them second on what grounds
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
good cause is the common standard for
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
subpoenas not reason to believe and
 
01:01:03.069 --> 01:01:03.079 align:start position:0%
third is at what time most legislation
 
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
and I'll document for you this is in
 
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
disciplinary hearings as was mentioned
 
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
doe hearings officers not in the initial
 
01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:13.640 align:start position:0%
search investigation I'll ask you to
 
01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
look at RSA 170e it deals with
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
residential care and child placing
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
agencies section 41 deals with subpoenas
 
01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
this is Department of Health and Human
 
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
Services same thing employees and
 
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
children under that statute subpoenas
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
can only be granted under meets three
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
criteria first there has to be a actual
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceeding that's not the
 
01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
case in the bill in front of you second
 
01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
there has to be good cause shown that's
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
far different from reason to believe and
 
01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:45.799 align:start position:0%
third it goes to the attorney general
 
01:01:48.069 --> 01:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
who must approve that subpoena in this
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
case the commissioner could do it by
 
01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
themselves this bill would violate all
 
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
three principles of due process so just
 
01:01:55.789 --> 01:01:55.799 align:start position:0%
just to look at those a little more in
 
01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
detail first is the attorney general
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
there's no other commissioner in New
 
01:02:02.029 --> 01:02:02.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who has unchecked powers to
 
01:02:04.269 --> 01:02:04.279 align:start position:0%
issue subpoenas the attorney general has
 
01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
the power to do subpoenas I just gave
 
01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:07.640 align:start position:0%
you the Department of Health and Human
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
Services representative Lynn mentioned
 
01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
charitable trust and consumer protection
 
01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:13.720 align:start position:0%
also if a common carrier of
 
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
communications like internet services if
 
01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:17.720 align:start position:0%
there's any Transmissions illegal that
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
goes through the Attorney General if
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
there's a statute if there's a need for
 
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:23.240 align:start position:0%
a third party it should go through the
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
Attorney General that's a Le four
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
examples where they do this routinely in
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire what about
 
01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
other states I tried to find some
 
01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
research on this and started to look
 
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
around individual states but stumbled
 
01:02:37.109 --> 01:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
upon a report by the national District
 
01:02:39.309 --> 01:02:39.319 align:start position:0%
Attorneys Association it's a 200-page
 
01:02:42.269 --> 01:02:42.279 align:start position:0%
report lists all 50 states it's called
 
01:02:44.269 --> 01:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
administrative subpoena Authority there
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
is no other state in the country that
 
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
gives education Commissioners this kind
 
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
of power it's interesting to note
 
01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:51.640 align:start position:0%
however many states in that report do
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
use the good cause standard so that's
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
first thing it's is it should go through
 
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General second is what
 
01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
should be the C what should be the level
 
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
of proof reason to believe or good cause
 
01:03:05.309 --> 01:03:05.319 align:start position:0%
many states for administrative um
 
01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
subpoenas use the good cause standard
 
01:03:08.589 --> 01:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
look at the New Hampshire rules of
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
professional conduct for lawyers rule
 
01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
4.5 a lawyer shall not issue or obtain
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
the issuance of a subpoena without good
 
01:03:16.829 --> 01:03:16.839 align:start position:0%
cause it's a phrase that's well
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
understood in law there's a famous case
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
in California that went through and set
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
up a seven-part test for what's a good
 
01:03:25.630 --> 01:03:25.640 align:start position:0%
cause subpoena specific to subpoenas
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
that's far better than using the reason
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
to believe standard which could pretty
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
much mean if whenever you feel like it
 
01:03:33.789 --> 01:03:33.799 align:start position:0%
third is the question of investigative
 
01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
stage or formal hearing stage as I
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
indicated the Department of Health and
 
01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
Human Services it only can be done at
 
01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
the disciplinary stage the
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative asked a question about
 
01:03:46.029 --> 01:03:46.039 align:start position:0%
doe special ed hearings officers that
 
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
means you're already having a hearing
 
01:03:50.109 --> 01:03:50.119 align:start position:0%
once you get to that stage then
 
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
subpoenas would be reasonable but if
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's a fishing expedition to gain
 
01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:55.480 align:start position:0%
information at that stage it's not
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
reasonable also I would refer you to the
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
state of Maine their administrative
 
01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
procedures act specifically talks about
 
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
subpoenas in situations where there are
 
01:04:05.269 --> 01:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
actual formal proceedings once you get
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
to that stage then subpoena powers are
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
normal but they should not be uh allowed
 
01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
in the beginning stages for fishing
 
01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
Expeditions otherwise you do have a
 
01:04:14.269 --> 01:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
chilling effect on teachers and there's
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
all the reasons why you heard from the
 
01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:19.039 align:start position:0%
previous Witnesses thank
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
you representative Perez thank you
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question may I ask
 
01:04:27.549 --> 01:04:27.559 align:start position:0%
your background sir um well I uh went to
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
law school at Franklin Pierce law school
 
01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
and I graduated in 1983 I practiced law
 
01:04:35.710 --> 01:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
in the state for five years I'm is in in
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
the law you can be either inactive or
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
active I'm on what they call inactive
 
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
status I maintain my membership but I
 
01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
did go to law school practice law did
 
01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:45.559 align:start position:0%
hundreds of cases so I have a legal
 
01:04:47.309 --> 01:04:47.319 align:start position:0%
background but I'm not offering myself
 
01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:49.480 align:start position:0%
as an attorney I'm just I I'm it just
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
taught me how to read a statute that's
 
01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
all thank you do you have copies of
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
represent of
 
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
tur yeah thank you and thanks for taking
 
01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
the question um and and I I'm recalling
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
your your testimony last year on this as
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
well um do other state agencies go
 
01:05:07.789 --> 01:05:07.799 align:start position:0%
through the Attorney General's house uh
 
01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
office when when they need um to to
 
01:05:14.029 --> 01:05:14.039 align:start position:0%
access a subpoena for some
 
01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:17.799 align:start position:0%
reason I I I looked up the individuals
 
01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
enabling statutes for other state
 
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
agencies they don't mention the word
 
01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
subpoena except for the example that I
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
found with Department of Heth and Human
 
01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
Services I would imagine though if they
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
have a disciplinary proceeding at that
 
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
point then they would go to the attorney
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
general but this this is a
 
01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
pre-disciplinary proceeding
 
01:05:37.549 --> 01:05:37.559 align:start position:0%
Bill any further questions for this
 
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you do you
 
01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
have written uh testimony I do and um it
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
only mentions uh but I didn't include
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
the disciplinary proceeding part because
 
01:05:48.589 --> 01:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
I didn't think that was going to come up
 
01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:50.200 align:start position:0%
but turned out to be quite an issue so
 
01:05:51.789 --> 01:05:51.799 align:start position:0%
it's slightly different than what I said
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
but I'll submit it anyway thank you
 
01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps oh oh my mistake that's correct
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.829 align:start position:0%
 
how

01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Deborah house I
 
01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
am president of the American Federation
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
of teachers New Hampshire I am here on
 
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
behalf of our 3700 members across the
 
01:06:38.109 --> 01:06:38.119 align:start position:0%
state most of whom work in K through 12
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
public education uh we work with about
 
01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
30,000 public school students in
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
districts across the state and I am here
 
01:06:48.029 --> 01:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
in opposition of this bill relative to
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
authorizing the commissioner of
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
Education uh to uh be able to issue
 
01:06:55.589 --> 01:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
subpoenas uh um one of the main reasons
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
I am opposing this is because as we
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
heard last year in a non gerain
 
01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
amendment to another bill that this is
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
not a
 
01:07:03.839 --> 01:07:05.390 align:start position:0%
not a
problem

01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:07:08.589 --> 01:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
the um Department of Education is
 
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
generally able to get what it needs when
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
it needs to investigate lure of teachers
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
investigate potential violations of the
 
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
code of conduct we heard from the lead
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
investigator we also heard from the
 
01:07:25.069 --> 01:07:25.079 align:start position:0%
attorney that they are able to get the
 
01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
documents they need uh sometimes they
 
01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
don't get them quite as quickly as they
 
01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
would like but they able to get what
 
01:07:32.029 --> 01:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
they want I was sitting here in this
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
room and heard that testimony so why do
 
01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
we have something that's going to change
 
01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
law to solve something that's not a
 
01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
problem um no one is saying that we
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
should be you
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
know allowing anyone to violate the code
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
of conduct but we all have a duty to
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
report when violations occur we also
 
01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.950 align:start position:0%
report when violations occur we also
have

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
investigations that occur on a local
 
01:07:59.789 --> 01:07:59.799 align:start position:0%
level when any of these things are being
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
violated that is going to turn into an
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
employment issue as soon as uh there is
 
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
a report made something is seen
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
something happens it's also going to
 
01:08:10.109 --> 01:08:10.119 align:start position:0%
turn into possibly depending upon the
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
severity of what is um what is being
 
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
alleged it's going to turn into a police
 
01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
investigation so having subpoenas coming
 
01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
out of the doe in the middle of that
 
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
could actually impede ongoing
 
01:08:22.839 --> 01:08:25.229 align:start position:0%
could actually impede ongoing
investigations

01:08:25.229 --> 01:08:25.239 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
so be very careful when you're
 
01:08:28.829 --> 01:08:28.839 align:start position:0%
considering this that you don't get in
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
the way of trying to resolve an ongoing
 
01:08:38.349 --> 01:08:38.359 align:start position:0%
situation by having a lure issue get
 
01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:40.759 align:start position:0%
right in the middle of it um no one is
 
01:08:42.789 --> 01:08:42.799 align:start position:0%
trying to stand up for bad actor staying
 
01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
in the school but this would give you a
 
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
false sense of security because it's
 
01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
aimed solely at credentialed Educators
 
01:08:50.749 --> 01:08:50.759 align:start position:0%
there are many adults who work in
 
01:08:52.030 --> 01:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
schools who are not credentialed
 
01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
Educators you've got cust Sans you've
 
01:08:56.189 --> 01:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
got food service workers you've got um
 
01:08:58.030 --> 01:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
some of our par educators are not
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
credential under the code of conduct um
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
what about all the people that students
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh see who are not licensed Educators in
 
01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
our public schools there are many
 
01:09:10.269 --> 01:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
students who go to private schools are
 
01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
students who are in um other situations
 
01:09:15.349 --> 01:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
that are now funded through our Voucher
 
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
Program where is their protection so
 
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
let's not rush to pass a bill that would
 
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
give a false sense of security this bill
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
is is not needed this bill would only
 
01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
give a false sense of Greater security
 
01:09:30.269 --> 01:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
and it also does not
 
01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
have the appropriate due process guard
 
01:09:36.749 --> 01:09:36.759 align:start position:0%
rails um it does not what kind of a
 
01:09:40.269 --> 01:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
standard is that the commissioner has
 
01:09:42.669 --> 01:09:42.679 align:start position:0%
reason to believe the commissioner is
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
certainly not out in all the school
 
01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:45.880 align:start position:0%
districts the commissioner is not
 
01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:47.759 align:start position:0%
observing things the commissioner is
 
01:09:47.759 --> 01:09:48.789 align:start position:0%
observing things the commissioner is
just

01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
hearing one piece of information through
 
01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
whatever means
 
01:09:56.669 --> 01:09:56.679 align:start position:0%
that is something that really should be
 
01:09:58.270 --> 01:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
coming up from the local districts
 
01:09:59.870 --> 01:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
through the duty to report through the
 
01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
code of conduct and through the investig
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
investigatory processes that are in
 
01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
place in the districts there are some
 
01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
things in here that are very broadly
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
worded um number three under the list of
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
things that need to be reported any
 
01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
alleged Act of endangerment or cruelty
 
01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
that's very broadly worded and is very
 
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
subjective that is going to open open
 
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
you up to a lot of legal wrangling
 
01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:30.280 align:start position:0%
number nine alleged failure to provide
 
01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate supervision P again
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate supervision is going to be
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
open to a lot of interpretation and
 
01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
could be used for a fishing
 
01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
Expedition um and alleged failure of a
 
01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
licensed educator to report suspected
 
01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
abuse at what point does it become
 
01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
suspected to abuse that could be very
 
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
subjective and could lead to over
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
reporting to
 
01:10:59.870 --> 01:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
avoid falling a fowl of this or to Under
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
reporting because you don't want to have
 
01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
someone feel you are being too cautious
 
01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
so you are opening a mindfield with this
 
01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
because now you're going to be afraid of
 
01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
being subpoenaed under the code of
 
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
conduct please this is not the right
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
tool to give someone who is also you
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
know holding your livelihood in their
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
hands with your teaching
 
01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
credential there is no way to have a
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
productive learning relationship with
 
01:11:35.669 --> 01:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
the Department of Ed that can also yank
 
01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
your license when you've given them this
 
01:11:41.629 --> 01:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
kind of power we urge you to find this
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate I do have
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
written testimony I try to um give you
 
01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
the Reader's Digest version and I will
 
01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
pass it around I'll take questions I'm
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
not sure they have any better answers
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
than the people who testify against it
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
ahead of me but representative Perez
 
01:11:59.790 --> 01:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking my question
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
um since you meant mentioned about the
 
01:12:06.189 --> 01:12:06.199 align:start position:0%
child abuse on here are you aware that
 
01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
there is a statute that teachers are
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
mandated yes by law to report any
 
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
suspected those specific words report
 
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
mandate and suspected child abuse yes
 
01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
are you aware that that is not not
 
01:12:27.070 --> 01:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
covered in any way if they don't do that
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
conduct now I would have to go back and
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
read my code of conduct over again I
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
believe this taken right from the code
 
01:12:42.910 --> 01:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
of conduct I know that it has always
 
01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
been drummed into my head that I was a
 
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
mandated reporter and I needed to report
 
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
it if it's not written in the code of
 
01:12:53.709 --> 01:12:53.719 align:start position:0%
conduct I thought it was so um I I I
 
01:12:55.229 --> 01:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
know it's something has been always
 
01:12:58.189 --> 01:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
covered in our professional development
 
01:13:03.149 --> 01:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
and our annual um policy review so if
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's not there I thought it was
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
too follow up yes the reason why I know
 
01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
it's there is I tried to get it in with
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
a bill this year and it was turned down
 
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
by the exact type of
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
um testimony that we're getting today so
 
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
it is not there even though it is a law
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
it is not we are mandated there's no
 
01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
argument about that it's it's just you
 
01:13:29.709 --> 01:13:29.719 align:start position:0%
know the wording of this makes me
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
concerned that we're now going to be
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
arguing at which point is your
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
suspicion serious enough you have to
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
report and at which point are you
 
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
overreacting um and and then
 
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
then then you get into a situation where
 
01:13:48.990 --> 01:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
if you report
 
01:13:52.629 --> 01:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
it are you going to be in trouble for
 
01:13:54.990 --> 01:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
reporting something you know our
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
family's going to be suing you for
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
reporting it
 
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
can't but having been in that situation
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
of having to make the call of what
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
to report when a child comes
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
in um and I've had to
 
01:14:18.629 --> 01:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
um it's never an easy call and you know
 
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
you do what you have to as a
 
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
professional um but yeah don't make
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
don't don't make it harder
 
01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
because then you're also
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
breaking the relationship you have with
 
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
that family and you don't get that back
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
either Mr chair representative D Lorenzo
 
01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:37.960 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:14:40.629 --> 01:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um are you aware
 
01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
that all adults of mandated reporters in
 
01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I was aware of that yes
 
01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.229 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I was aware of that yes
thank

01:14:47.229 --> 01:14:47.239 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:49.800 align:start position:0%

01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
witness representative Stapleton thank
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for take my question
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
would this be improved if uh on page one
 
01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh Roman 13 line four instead of has
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
reason to believe uh there might be
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
something better like probable cause to
 
01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:12.910 align:start position:0%
something better like probable cause to
give

01:15:12.910 --> 01:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
give
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
U the initiation of the action some
 
01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:17.550 align:start position:0%
U the initiation of the action some
better

01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:15:20.430 --> 01:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
basis if
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
it um I I all honesty I'm reading
 
01:15:25.709 --> 01:15:25.719 align:start position:0%
teacher I am not a lawyer so I would
 
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
like to you know have a lawyer look that
 
01:15:33.149 --> 01:15:33.159 align:start position:0%
over to uh get a read on that it seems
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
like it might be but um that's that's a
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
reading teachers take on
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
it representative Paige thank you thank
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I know you're
 
01:15:46.270 --> 01:15:46.280 align:start position:0%
not a lawyer but given what you
 
01:15:49.229 --> 01:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
know backing up with what representative
 
01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
Stapleton mentioned if we were to amend
 
01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
that and it was the attorney attorney
 
01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
general with probable cause would that
 
01:15:58.430 --> 01:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
give you more Comfort why attorney
 
01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
general seems like a a much more
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate place because you also don't
 
01:16:04.030 --> 01:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
have the conflict
 
01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
between the Department of Education is
 
01:16:13.629 --> 01:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
also tasked with helping to develop and
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
really grow the professionalism of the
 
01:16:18.030 --> 01:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
whole teaching Workforce in the state so
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
we can better serve all our students so
 
01:16:22.030 --> 01:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
when your boss is the one who's supposed
 
01:16:23.790 --> 01:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
to your boss the of education is
 
01:16:26.189 --> 01:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
supposed to be our boss okay supposed to
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
help us all learn how to serve students
 
01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:30.679 align:start position:0%
better and when that's also the one
 
01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
who's you know going come with the
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
subpoenas because you
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
know pil you to provide appropriate
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
supervision which in some instances
 
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
maybe someone complained about a poster
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
on your wall that
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
may um welcome all students so that they
 
01:16:51.229 --> 01:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
feel safe and in part of your classroom
 
01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
and someone thought that was
 
01:16:52.239 --> 01:16:54.510 align:start position:0%
and someone thought that was
inappropriate

01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
um yeah it it it's hard to look up to
 
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
someone who's got subpoena over that
 
01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:02.790 align:start position:0%
someone who's got subpoena over that
kind

01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
kind
 
01:17:06.669 --> 01:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
of artwork in your
 
01:17:11.310 --> 01:17:11.320 align:start position:0%
classroom yeah it just does not lead to
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
an atmosphere where you feel you can
 
01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
learn from a person like that and grow
 
01:17:17.709 --> 01:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
to be a better teacher and better serve
 
01:17:17.719 --> 01:17:18.629 align:start position:0%
to be a better teacher and better serve
your

01:17:18.629 --> 01:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
students representative cutab MH thank
 
01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
question I guess in regard to the last
 
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
statement that you just made regarding
 
01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
you know looking up to a boss and and
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
the a poster on the wall I don't think
 
01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
that this bill was meant to to be
 
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
anything to do with a poster on the wall
 
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
some pretty serious allegations and
 
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
isn't a boss supposed to kind of make
 
01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
sure that you're doing the right thing
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
on here I mean would you feel better if
 
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
this was more tailored to to exclude
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
wherever you which whichever line you
 
01:17:57.709 --> 01:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
think is saying that it can be a poster
 
01:17:59.550 --> 01:17:59.560 align:start position:0%
on the on the wall like I'd like to know
 
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
which line you think that is because I'm
 
01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
seeing sexual assault physical assault
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
endangerment cruelty like a lot of very
 
01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:08.790 align:start position:0%
endangerment cruelty like a lot of very
serious

01:18:08.790 --> 01:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
serious
 
01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
allegations I don't where's the one
 
01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
about a poster on the wall I must be
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:23.629 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:18:23.629 --> 01:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:18:28.510 --> 01:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
if you kept it to strictly narrowly
 
01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
defined terms that might improve it but
 
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
we've also seen through the divisive
 
01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
Concepts lawsuit that indeed the
 
01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
department has engaged in fishing
 
01:18:41.709 --> 01:18:41.719 align:start position:0%
Expeditions so I don't think giving them
 
01:18:43.629 --> 01:18:43.639 align:start position:0%
more tools to allow them to engage in
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
more fishing Expeditions is going to be
 
01:18:51.149 --> 01:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you representative
 
01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:54.080 align:start position:0%

Education could not go through the

Attorney General's office if they needed
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
to subpoena something I am not aware of
 
01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:15.800 align:start position:0%

Hall thereby not
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
disrupting any ongoing classes he had

person on that floor EX except for
 
01:20:55.709 --> 01:20:55.719 align:start position:0%
another um child who was my daughter

she was allowed to go up to that floor
 
01:21:01.709 --> 01:21:01.719 align:start position:0%
to grab her
 
01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:05.280 align:start position:0%

01:21:08.189 --> 01:21:08.199 align:start position:0%
afraid to file the police
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
report the par professional seemed very
 
01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
afraid the mandated there are no teeth
 
01:21:19.950 --> 01:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
in the mandated reporter
 
01:21:23.229 --> 01:21:23.239 align:start position:0%
law there's no enforcement of that they
 
01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
circle the wagons this particular
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
teacher could be heard on a regular
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
basis screaming at these children from
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
the library to classrooms away where I
 
01:21:39.629 --> 01:21:39.639 align:start position:0%
volunteered my son had sensitivity to
 
01:21:42.990 --> 01:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
sound and as a special
 
01:21:46.270 --> 01:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
educated trained teacher she was aware
 
01:21:48.990 --> 01:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
of this she was aware of another student
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
being very sensitive to
 
01:21:54.430 --> 01:21:54.440 align:start position:0%
light she she would use an adjacent
 
01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
classroom sometimes and um get one kid
 
01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
in trouble for the light
 
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
sensitivity tried to that he was in
 
01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
there with my son um my son said yeah it
 
01:22:09.790 --> 01:22:09.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't me that turned off the light it
 
01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
was the other kid everybody knows with
 
01:22:14.189 --> 01:22:14.199 align:start position:0%
him it's light with me it's
 
01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
sound she would cause physical pain to
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
both of these children at any
 
01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.629 align:start position:0%
both of these children at any
opportunity

01:22:23.629 --> 01:22:23.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
professional claimed that they were
 
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
merely escorting the child to the
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
principal's office but that explanation
 
01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
didn't explain how he came off the floor
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
and um into there into the position
 
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
where he could be escorted there were no
 
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
cameras this teacher was dismissed the
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
following year I had asked privately
 
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
went into the principal and said keep an
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
eye on those cameras I've heard from my
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
neighbors it's a neighborhood School a
 
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
public school I've heard from my cameras
 
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
this woman from my neighbors This
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
Woman's been doing this for quite
 
01:23:11.149 --> 01:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
sometime and now the cameras are there
 
01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:13.000 align:start position:0%

dragged through the
 
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
hallways he will never forget it he's 21
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
now and wanted to bring him um to
 
01:23:27.229 --> 01:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
testify but I really didn't want to um
 
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
pull up the PTSD that he still has he
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
said he would never forget it I believe
 
01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:40.669 --> 01:23:40.679 align:start position:0%

went to work somewhere else I don't
 
01:23:52.709 --> 01:23:52.719 align:start position:0%
actually she was um I I guess guess I
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
misspoke she retired at age 47 the
 
01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
following year which I thought was quite
 
01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
suspicious okay um but I wasn't privy to
 
01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:08.639 align:start position:0%
any background of why that might have
 
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
happened thank you any further questions
 
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you thank you
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%

else wishes to speak on House Bill 1353
 
01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to get some
 
01:24:25.629 --> 01:24:25.639 align:start position:0%
technical assistance from Miss Fenton
 
01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:27.400 align:start position:0%
that I see as in the audience just to
 
01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
ask because we did have several kind of
 
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
from the test testimony pointing out
 
01:24:34.629 --> 01:24:34.639 align:start position:0%
about the doe being able to get the
 
01:24:36.189 --> 01:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
documents already and I just I want to
 
01:24:40.109 --> 01:24:40.119 align:start position:0%
clarify is this still the case um are
 
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
they able to actually get what they need
 
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
would that be possible M Mr chair could
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
I just ask a followup on the
 
01:24:47.550 --> 01:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
housekeeping business is not to it's
 
01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
somewhat related in that some folks have
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
submitted testimony with insufficient
 
01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
copies if they've submitted them
 
01:24:54.750 --> 01:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
electronically if you're still in the
 
01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
room that's great but if you just had a
 
01:24:59.149 --> 01:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
hard copy Mr Trumble and
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
um uh Christine Downing for two so I
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that that's in
 
01:25:06.270 --> 01:25:06.280 align:start position:0%
the record somewhere yes the clerk has
 
01:25:07.629 --> 01:25:07.639 align:start position:0%
those and we'll distribute them to the
 
01:25:12.510 --> 01:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
you microphone please thank you there we
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
go I knew I was missing something uh
 
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record my name is
 
01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
Diana Fenton I'm an attorney with the
 
01:25:24.149 --> 01:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
Education I oversee the code of conduct
 
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any technical
 
01:25:30.669 --> 01:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
questions that this committee might have
 
01:25:32.669 --> 01:25:32.679 align:start position:0%
that pertains to House Bill
 
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
1353 I will just uh initially address
 
01:25:38.430 --> 01:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
that um my understanding in speaking
 
01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
with the Attorney General's office and I
 
01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
want to be clear it's just my
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
understanding I I could be mistaken I'm
 
01:25:45.109 --> 01:25:45.119 align:start position:0%
interested in what the gentleman had to
 
01:25:48.430 --> 01:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
say about the DHHS statute um allowing
 
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office to issue
 
01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
uh subpoenas on behalf of of another
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
agency but my understanding in speaking
 
01:25:56.030 --> 01:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
with the Attorney General's office is
 
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
that they are not able to do that um it
 
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
does sound from the prior testimony that
 
01:26:03.629 --> 01:26:03.639 align:start position:0%
there would have to be a a
 
01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
statutory um enactment for that to occur
 
01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
certainly that is a possibility that the
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Education would not be
 
01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
opposed to but that would be have have
 
01:26:17.310 --> 01:26:17.320 align:start position:0%
to be something to to be looked at um
 
01:26:20.109 --> 01:26:20.119 align:start position:0%
also on page two of the bill and I think
 
01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
this will help to um address some of the
 
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
issues is in line two and three it says
 
01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:26.750 align:start position:0%
issues is in line two and three it says
the

01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
investigation must pertain to a
 
01:26:31.229 --> 01:26:31.239 align:start position:0%
certified educator and the individual
 
01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
must be under investigation in
 
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
accordance with the rule so that term
 
01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:35.990 align:start position:0%
accordance with the rule so that term
under

01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
investigation is a term of art for lack
 
01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
of a better uh understanding in
 
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
accordance with the Department's
 
01:26:45.709 --> 01:26:45.719 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and the
 
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
investigative piece is when the educator
 
01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
is notified formally via certified mail
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
that they are actually being looked at
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
they are under investigation and that is
 
01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:57.750 align:start position:0%
they are under investigation and that is
opposed

01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
01:27:00.510 --> 01:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
to um the department receiving a phone
 
01:27:03.550 --> 01:27:03.560 align:start position:0%
call saying this happened to my child we
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
want you to look into it and the
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner just saying all right let's
 
01:27:09.229 --> 01:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
issue a subpoena and look into it we
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
have to have enough of a factual basis
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
to put someone under investigation and
 
01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
that's why as part of this bill there
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
has to be that threshold if you will to
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
then um allow for the issuance of a
 
01:27:24.910 --> 01:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
subpoena uh the department is happy to
 
01:27:26.590 --> 01:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
take any questions the department is
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
also happy to work with uh the other
 
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and the sponsor of this
 
01:27:33.390 --> 01:27:33.400 align:start position:0%
bill to further address any of the
 
01:27:36.510 --> 01:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
raised representative kab thank you Mr
 
01:27:40.990 --> 01:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
question and coming here today we we
 
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
heard some testimony related to this
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
bill isn't needed that you guys are able
 
01:27:50.189 --> 01:27:50.199 align:start position:0%
to already get the documents that you
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
need and I just I wanted to to to
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
clarify are you able to get copies of
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
the documents that you would need to
 
01:27:59.870 --> 01:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
actually kind of do some sort of due
 
01:28:02.669 --> 01:28:02.679 align:start position:0%
process with this so if you could please
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
elaborate on that I'd appreciate it sure
 
01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
so in large part we have a really good
 
01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
working relationship with the districts
 
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
and our partners and we want to maintain
 
01:28:13.030 --> 01:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
that really good positive working
 
01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:14.750 align:start position:0%
that really good positive working
relationship

01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
and the resistance if any that we have
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
received because again most districts
 
01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
are very Cooperative with us the idea
 
01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
being that if there's an educator who is
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
misbehaving and harming children in
 
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
their District they want to work with
 
01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
the department they want to ensure that
 
01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
that individual will not have access to
 
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
other children in other districts we're
 
01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
all on the same page with that concept
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
um there have been times where school
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
districts and their attorneys will say
 
01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
you have to come into the law firm
 
01:28:48.270 --> 01:28:48.280 align:start position:0%
office you cannot take the report with
 
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
you you can only review it it is the
 
01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
property of the school dist district and
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
the law firm that hired that outside
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
party to to do that investigation and so
 
01:29:00.189 --> 01:29:00.199 align:start position:0%
there have been times where I have gone
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
into law firms and just been allowed to
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
review it I cannot take it with me and
 
01:29:07.310 --> 01:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
that can cause problems moving
 
01:29:09.790 --> 01:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
forward but my testimony last year and
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
my testimony this year is in large part
 
01:29:14.669 --> 01:29:14.679 align:start position:0%
we have very good working relationships
 
01:29:17.149 --> 01:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
I cannot sit here and say there was a
 
01:29:18.910 --> 01:29:18.920 align:start position:0%
case that the department could not move
 
01:29:20.990 --> 01:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
forward on because I could not have
 
01:29:22.430 --> 01:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
access to that report
 
01:29:25.390 --> 01:29:25.400 align:start position:0%
but there have been times um notably the
 
01:29:28.709 --> 01:29:28.719 align:start position:0%
ho Lan case right here in conquer where
 
01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
I had to go into the law firm I had to
 
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
read the report I could not take it with
 
01:29:36.669 --> 01:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
me I had to follow up later and ask for
 
01:29:38.510 --> 01:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
that report and send them a request
 
01:29:40.030 --> 01:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
letter that they could have easily
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
denied they were able to turn that over
 
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
to me but in that kind of case the
 
01:29:47.550 --> 01:29:47.560 align:start position:0%
department does not want to be in the
 
01:29:50.109 --> 01:29:50.119 align:start position:0%
position where we are unable to get the
 
01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
information that we need this really is
 
01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
just a a a tool of Last Resort it should
 
01:29:57.189 --> 01:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
not be used as a as a witch hunt or
 
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
anything like that any safeguards that
 
01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
this committee is willing to put into
 
01:30:04.750 --> 01:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
place the department is is happy to work
 
01:30:06.189 --> 01:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
with this committee and the stakeholders
 
01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
consensus representative Perez one last
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
question y sealed records do you ever
 
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
have any problem getting sealed in
 
01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:24.189 align:start position:0%
have any problem getting sealed in
records

01:30:24.189 --> 01:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
I can't think of a time where I've had
 
01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
that fact pattern in this particular
 
01:30:31.310 --> 01:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
role I could imagine that that would be
 
01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
rather challenging um and that would
 
01:30:37.229 --> 01:30:37.239 align:start position:0%
probably be an instance in which we
 
01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
would utilize a subpoena but I can't sit
 
01:30:42.189 --> 01:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
here today and say oh there was a case
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
in which we weren't able to access those
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
records um that's just not an experience
 
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
that I've had and again I want to
 
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
emphasize that in large part we have
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
have really good working reports with
 
01:30:55.709 --> 01:30:55.719 align:start position:0%
the district which is what everyone
 
01:30:59.790 --> 01:30:59.800 align:start position:0%
ultimately wants um but the districts
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
have their own attorneys and their
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
attorneys work on hiring these
 
01:31:07.629 --> 01:31:07.639 align:start position:0%
third-party investigators to produce
 
01:31:10.109 --> 01:31:10.119 align:start position:0%
very lengthy very well done sometimes
 
01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
very expensive reports and that is their
 
01:31:14.350 --> 01:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
property it does not belong to the
 
01:31:16.229 --> 01:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and their
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
lawyers certainly can say we want to
 
01:31:21.109 --> 01:31:21.119 align:start position:0%
protect ourselves our clients and our
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
districts and we would like legal
 
01:31:25.709 --> 01:31:25.719 align:start position:0%
process and that's really what this tool
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
for the Department is trying to
 
01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:30.520 align:start position:0%
anticipate and and work with the
 
01:31:33.430 --> 01:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
districts on that but in no way uh shape
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
or form does the department want to do
 
01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
anything that would harm those really
 
01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
positive good working relationships with
 
01:31:40.990 --> 01:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
the districts thank you very much for
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
your time representative Ming did you
 
01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
have a question please just a quick one
 
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
um is under investigation def a defined
 
01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
term in the administrative rules it is
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
set out in our administrative rules I
 
01:31:55.950 --> 01:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head I don't know if
 
01:31:57.390 --> 01:31:57.400 align:start position:0%
it's listed as you don't have to give me
 
01:31:59.709 --> 01:31:59.719 align:start position:0%
a citation but thank you because I'm not
 
01:32:03.149 --> 01:32:03.159 align:start position:0%
able to do that but um uh in the revised
 
01:32:04.950 --> 01:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
rules that we're currently working on we
 
01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
do we do Define what investigation is
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
but for our purpose it it is a term of
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
Art and I appreciate the question thank
 
01:32:16.109 --> 01:32:16.119 align:start position:0%
you representative tur yeah uh thank you
 
01:32:18.109 --> 01:32:18.119 align:start position:0%
and thanks for the question these
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
reports that you said are owned by the
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
districts and and and their attorneys
 
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
are they um subject to 91a can they be
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:34.189 --> 01:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
know that's a good question
 
01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
I um well I I think the short answer and
 
01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not a right to know expert I'm
 
01:32:42.270 --> 01:32:42.280 align:start position:0%
certainly familiar enough with that
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
version of the law as a state employee
 
01:32:49.229 --> 01:32:49.239 align:start position:0%
um yes I think the short answer is yes
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
but they would be heavily redacted and I
 
01:32:55.629 --> 01:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
think if we we um recall the conquered
 
01:32:57.750 --> 01:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
school district report as it pertained
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
to the ho leang case I think that um
 
01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
that was released under right to know if
 
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
I recall correctly and it was released
 
01:33:09.390 --> 01:33:09.400 align:start position:0%
to the public um May was heavily
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
redacted but again you're going on my
 
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
memory uh so please take it all with a
 
01:33:17.149 --> 01:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
grain of sand but I think that's
 
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
right thank you attorney fenon if you
 
01:33:20.910 --> 01:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
could just do us a favor fill out an
 
01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
appearance card I will certainly do that
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
01:33:26.109 --> 01:33:26.119 align:start position:0%
we'll now close the hearing to House
 
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 1353 we'll let everyone in the room
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
know we're about 45 minutes behind
 
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
schedule so we're going to roll right
 
01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
into house bill
 
01:33:36.990 --> 01:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
1115 and uh if you've gotten written
 
01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
testimony again please do not read it to
 
01:33:41.109 --> 01:33:41.119 align:start position:0%
us we're capable of doing so give us the
 
01:33:43.590 --> 01:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
sweet and condensed version and uh we'll
 
01:33:45.870 --> 01:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
try to get back on course to the members
 
01:33:48.030 --> 01:33:48.040 align:start position:0%
of the committee you'll get one question
 
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
each until everybody else has asked a
 
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
question and then we'll go to round two
 
01:33:54.080 --> 01:34:10.910 align:start position:0%
question and then we'll go to round two
thank

01:34:10.910 --> 01:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
you and once again representative Lynn
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
stage uh thank you Mr chair I guess this
 
01:34:24.510 --> 01:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
is my day to be to be a witness rather
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
than uh a member of the of the uh asking
 
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
questions but anyway I'm Bob Lynn I'm a
 
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative from Windam um and uh
 
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill HB
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
11115 uh I'm not going to spend a lot of
 
01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
time on this because I assume you're all
 
01:34:43.629 --> 01:34:43.639 align:start position:0%
familiar with this this is this is I
 
01:34:45.229 --> 01:34:45.239 align:start position:0%
think the third time I've introduced
 
01:34:48.510 --> 01:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
this bill it didn't pass the first time
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
it passed last year uh the house
 
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
but uh died in the Senate
 
01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
um this bill um is uh I have to say it's
 
01:35:03.669 --> 01:35:03.679 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a pet peeve of mine because
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
it reflects it's an effort to overturn
 
01:35:10.229 --> 01:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
uh a New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
decision that U to me just doesn't make
 
01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
any sense um uh essentially that
 
01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:18.189 align:start position:0%
any sense um uh essentially that
decision

01:35:18.189 --> 01:35:18.199 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
says that if you have if a uh a landlord
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
of restricted property and basically
 
01:35:29.709 --> 01:35:29.719 align:start position:0%
that can mean uh if you are a landlord
 
01:35:33.550 --> 01:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
as small as a landlord that owns a uh
 
01:35:35.310 --> 01:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
two rental units as long as you don't
 
01:35:39.310 --> 01:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
live in one of them um uh if you if you
 
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
own a two unit non occupy you that you
 
01:35:46.109 --> 01:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
don't live in two you rent out to two uh
 
01:35:47.709 --> 01:35:47.719 align:start position:0%
you have a duplex and you rent out both
 
01:35:50.590 --> 01:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
units to other people you are subject to
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh that's rest restricted
 
01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
property you are then if if you enter
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
into a lease with a tenant for a
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
year at the end of the year the tenant
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
can can
 
01:36:06.430 --> 01:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
leave you on the other hand if the
 
01:36:09.910 --> 01:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
tenant does not want to leave you cannot
 
01:36:12.910 --> 01:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
evict the tenant um under this New
 
01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court decision
 
01:36:18.750 --> 01:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
um I think I've kind of gone into the
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
details of this previously and I don't
 
01:36:21.790 --> 01:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
want to take up time because I know
 
01:36:23.709 --> 01:36:23.719 align:start position:0%
we're late the only thing I would say is
 
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
I know that there are a number of a
 
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
number of people here to testify in
 
01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
opposition to this I suspect that much
 
01:36:32.109 --> 01:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
of what they will say is that um
 
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
particularly or among the things they'll
 
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
say is that the the uh the housing
 
01:36:39.229 --> 01:36:39.239 align:start position:0%
market is very tight right now and that
 
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
the you know this is would be a bad
 
01:36:44.189 --> 01:36:44.199 align:start position:0%
thing to do uh given the the housing
 
01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
market I I guess I would um this is you
 
01:36:50.709 --> 01:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
know based I guess on their view of
 
01:36:53.390 --> 01:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
economics it would seem to me that the
 
01:36:56.669 --> 01:36:56.679 align:start position:0%
opposite is actually true
 
01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
because what you do what the what the
 
01:37:05.149 --> 01:37:05.159 align:start position:0%
law as it now stands means to a
 
01:37:05.159 --> 01:37:07.870 align:start position:0%
law as it now stands means to a
prospective

01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
prospective
 
01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
landlord don't take a chance on a on
 
01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
some tenant that may be marginal that
 
01:37:17.470 --> 01:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
may that may be marginal because if you
 
01:37:20.910 --> 01:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
do um you're stuck with that tenant uh
 
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
you cannot evict the tenant and
 
01:37:25.629 --> 01:37:25.639 align:start position:0%
potentially um that that you know the
 
01:37:27.390 --> 01:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
tenant could stay there for a very long
 
01:37:31.229 --> 01:37:31.239 align:start position:0%
time whereas if the law was that you
 
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
know if a if you make a year a lease for
 
01:37:35.669 --> 01:37:35.679 align:start position:0%
a year it actually means that the lease
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
is for a
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
year landlords May might be very will
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
may be very willing to say well all
 
01:37:44.830 --> 01:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
right you know this person's credit
 
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
report was a little sketchy or um
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
somehow I've heard that you know maybe
 
01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
this uh this uh uh this person is uh
 
01:37:58.910 --> 01:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
boisterous or whatever and I'm going to
 
01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
have other neighbors are going to be
 
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
complaining or whatever um but it's you
 
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
know I'm willing to take a chance
 
01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
because it's only for a year and at the
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
end of the year if it turns out that my
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
worst fears are are realized then
 
01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
um then I just won't renew the lease the
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
the landlord can't do that now and to
 
01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
the extent that that people would say
 
01:38:27.629 --> 01:38:27.639 align:start position:0%
well you know if they're if the landlord
 
01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
if the tenant really was uh uh abusive
 
01:38:35.189 --> 01:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
or uh did something uh that you you know
 
01:38:37.870 --> 01:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
was dealing drugs or doing some other
 
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
some other uh uh bad thing then then
 
01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
that's a separate grounds for evicting
 
01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
them sure it is a separate grounds for
 
01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
evicting the problem is proving it the
 
01:38:50.990 --> 01:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
problem is trying to prove it um you
 
01:38:53.229 --> 01:38:53.239 align:start position:0%
know you know will will
 
01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
you will you be able to get other
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
tenants to say that yes this this tenant
 
01:39:01.390 --> 01:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
was uh was uh dealing drugs or using
 
01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
drugs or whatever or will the tenants be
 
01:39:04.990 --> 01:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
afraid to the other tenants be afraid to
 
01:39:07.149 --> 01:39:07.159 align:start position:0%
do that U will will other tenants be
 
01:39:10.510 --> 01:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
willing to say um uh you know this
 
01:39:12.629 --> 01:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
person was always uh they were always
 
01:39:14.510 --> 01:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
making a lot of noise they were up late
 
01:39:16.270 --> 01:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
at night they were always carousing
 
01:39:19.310 --> 01:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
whatever um uh and interrupting other
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
town or will they be afraid to do that
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
um that's what a landlord will have
 
01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
those are the things that a landlord
 
01:39:28.229 --> 01:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
will have to think about and and
 
01:39:31.629 --> 01:39:31.639 align:start position:0%
uh that will discourage if the law
 
01:39:33.229 --> 01:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
remains as it is that will discourage
 
01:39:36.669 --> 01:39:36.679 align:start position:0%
landlords from taking a chance on on
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
marginal tenants which it seems to me
 
01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
will will work to the detriment of the
 
01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
of the very people that many of the
 
01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:47.159 align:start position:0%
opponents of this bill uh say they want
 
01:39:49.589 --> 01:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
to protect uh with that I'm happy to
 
01:39:51.950 --> 01:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative
 
01:39:57.149 --> 01:39:57.159 align:start position:0%
Lynn none thank you representative
 
01:39:58.830 --> 01:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
charlottte De
 
01:40:02.589 --> 01:40:02.599 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo I'm sorry representative Ming my
 
01:40:05.790 --> 01:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
apologies yeah thank you and uh thank
 
01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um since I'm
 
01:40:10.149 --> 01:40:10.159 align:start position:0%
new to the committee maybe you can humar
 
01:40:12.510 --> 01:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
me and um just kind of go into the
 
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
reason for the six-month term being oh
 
01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
essentially the floor ceiling depending
 
01:40:19.070 --> 01:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
on how you look at it yeah no no no no
 
01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
that's very I'm sorry I'm sorry
 
01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:22.199 align:start position:0%
representative m I I forgot about that
 
01:40:24.910 --> 01:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
but no you're right I I think the
 
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
one the uh and I I remember um when I
 
01:40:32.589 --> 01:40:32.599 align:start position:0%
first introduced this bill uh before I
 
01:40:34.750 --> 01:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
did I had a discussion I believe with
 
01:40:37.229 --> 01:40:37.239 align:start position:0%
with uh attorney Barry who is here today
 
01:40:39.310 --> 01:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
who will I know who I know opposes this
 
01:40:41.149 --> 01:40:41.159 align:start position:0%
bill but one of the things that I
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
thought he he raised a valid point on
 
01:40:45.629 --> 01:40:45.639 align:start position:0%
that I agreed with and that's why I
 
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
Chang this is if if you have a very
 
01:40:51.070 --> 01:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
short-term lease and I thought that the
 
01:40:54.270 --> 01:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
six-month you know thing it I I think in
 
01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
that circumstance it it is fair to say
 
01:41:00.270 --> 01:41:00.280 align:start position:0%
that the the parties to the lease sort
 
01:41:02.669 --> 01:41:02.679 align:start position:0%
of anticipate that you know it's it's
 
01:41:04.629 --> 01:41:04.639 align:start position:0%
not likely that the lease is going to be
 
01:41:06.910 --> 01:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
terminated in such a very short period
 
01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
of time so I think in that circumstance
 
01:41:13.149 --> 01:41:13.159 align:start position:0%
that that's that's why I I uh I put the
 
01:41:16.430 --> 01:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
the six-month cap in uh once it gets you
 
01:41:18.189 --> 01:41:18.199 align:start position:0%
know I I and I think that's a reasonable
 
01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
period of a reasonable period of time
 
01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:26.719 align:start position:0%
follow up um thank you um so so that
 
01:41:29.709 --> 01:41:29.719 align:start position:0%
that's fine for a full for a contracted
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
lease um but for a tenant Let's see we
 
01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
can even go to the language right here
 
01:41:41.470 --> 01:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
um line three for lease or tency the
 
01:41:43.629 --> 01:41:43.639 align:start position:0%
term of Which is less than six months
 
01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
but which has been renewed for a total
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
period of six months or longer
 
01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
um can you can you kind of get in get
 
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
into that aspect of it because I I I do
 
01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
I I see see your point with with a
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
contracted term but maybe you could
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
address that as well sure so I what I'm
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
what I was think the reason I worded it
 
01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
this way is what I was thinking is and I
 
01:42:06.189 --> 01:42:06.199 align:start position:0%
think this may be relatively rare but
 
01:42:09.149 --> 01:42:09.159 align:start position:0%
probably not you know not not extremely
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
rare is if you had a tenant that right
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
from the beginning rented on a
 
01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:16.750 align:start position:0%
from the beginning rented on a
month-to-month

01:42:16.750 --> 01:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
month-to-month
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
basis you know I could see even though
 
01:42:21.550 --> 01:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
you even though that circumstance you
 
01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
might technically say well look you you
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
know you you knew from the beginning
 
01:42:28.189 --> 01:42:28.199 align:start position:0%
this was only a one Monon lease and
 
01:42:31.709 --> 01:42:31.719 align:start position:0%
technically that's true I think most of
 
01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
the time it's fair to say that a tenant
 
01:42:35.550 --> 01:42:35.560 align:start position:0%
would anticipate and I think the
 
01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
landlord would anticipate that you know
 
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
unless there was some something really
 
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
unusual where the tenant said you know
 
01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
look I need to rent this place for 30
 
01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:45.320 align:start position:0%
days but then I'm leaving um in which
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
case you'd presumably have uh you know a
 
01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
specific term that said that but if you
 
01:42:52.470 --> 01:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
if the if the landlord and the Tenant
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
just rent on a on a month-to-month basis
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
for 30 days it would seem to me that it
 
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable to say the tenant
 
01:43:03.149 --> 01:43:03.159 align:start position:0%
probably expects and so does the
 
01:43:05.589 --> 01:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
landlord that this is going to be this
 
01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
is going to go on and uh and that and
 
01:43:10.109 --> 01:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
that the landlord you know is not going
 
01:43:12.350 --> 01:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
to is not going to throw you out at
 
01:43:15.149 --> 01:43:15.159 align:start position:0%
least for six months uh despite what you
 
01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
know technically uh the the the term of
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
the lease might say so I don't have any
 
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
problem first for with with up to six
 
01:43:24.990 --> 01:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
months and that's why I put that in the
 
01:43:27.390 --> 01:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
way the way I
 
01:43:30.589 --> 01:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
did thank you representative
 
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
Stapleton thank you and thank you for
 
01:43:33.629 --> 01:43:33.639 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
01:43:33.639 --> 01:43:35.350 align:start position:0%
taking my
question

01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:43:40.350 --> 01:43:40.360 align:start position:0%
um you know in a lease or rental
 
01:43:44.990 --> 01:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
contract um would there not be
 
01:43:48.510 --> 01:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
um termination for cause uh or
 
01:43:51.390 --> 01:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
nonrenewal for cause if there's for
 
01:43:54.990 --> 01:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
instance a troubling or risky tenant and
 
01:43:57.589 --> 01:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
certain actions are enumerated within a
 
01:43:59.790 --> 01:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
lease or rental
 
01:44:03.629 --> 01:44:03.639 align:start position:0%
contract um that that would afford the
 
01:44:03.639 --> 01:44:05.390 align:start position:0%
contract um that that would afford the
protections

01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
protections
 
01:44:08.109 --> 01:44:08.119 align:start position:0%
that that you're looking for here as
 
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to just a
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
blanket um right to cut off at the end
 
01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:16.719 align:start position:0%
of the term of the lease well well no I
 
01:44:19.870 --> 01:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
mean that that's a there are a number of
 
01:44:22.669 --> 01:44:22.679 align:start position:0%
things in the St statute now that you
 
01:44:25.149 --> 01:44:25.159 align:start position:0%
know that do constitute a grounds for
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
for eviction so that I mean and among
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
those would be you know taking action
 
01:44:32.669 --> 01:44:32.679 align:start position:0%
that's detriment you know damaging the
 
01:44:35.589 --> 01:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
property for example or or disrupting
 
01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
the quiet enjoyment of other tenants and
 
01:44:39.430 --> 01:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
those kind of things that you
 
01:44:42.830 --> 01:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
know those un those unquestionably would
 
01:44:44.430 --> 01:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
be grounds for terminating for
 
01:44:48.430 --> 01:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
terminating the tency the problem is
 
01:44:51.310 --> 01:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:44:54.589 --> 01:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
you got to prove that and and you know
 
01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
what the
 
01:45:01.709 --> 01:45:01.719 align:start position:0%
the the concern that I have uh for I
 
01:45:03.229 --> 01:45:03.239 align:start position:0%
mean beyond the fact beyond the fact
 
01:45:04.470 --> 01:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
that it seems to me a contract should
 
01:45:06.750 --> 01:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
mean what it says but the other concern
 
01:45:09.629 --> 01:45:09.639 align:start position:0%
from a sort of policy perspective is if
 
01:45:13.070 --> 01:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
you want to encourage landlords to rent
 
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
property to people that might have
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
otherwise have a hard time finding being
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
able to rent property it seems to me the
 
01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
wrong thing to do is to say to the to
 
01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:24.510 align:start position:0%
wrong thing to do is to say to the to
the

01:45:24.510 --> 01:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
landlord there will be no time limit on
 
01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
this lease because then the landlord
 
01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
might say well you know I I really have
 
01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
some concerns I'm on the fence about
 
01:45:37.950 --> 01:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
whether I should leas to this person or
 
01:45:40.350 --> 01:45:40.360 align:start position:0%
not if the landlord is in that
 
01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
circumstance now under existing law the
 
01:45:45.149 --> 01:45:45.159 align:start position:0%
landlord's going to has to say to
 
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
himself if I if I sign this lease with
 
01:45:50.830 --> 01:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
this person it may say a year year but
 
01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:52.639 align:start position:0%
it's not really a year it's as long as
 
01:45:54.629 --> 01:45:54.639 align:start position:0%
the tenant wants to stay there as long
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
as the tenant continues to pay the rent
 
01:45:58.109 --> 01:45:58.119 align:start position:0%
and all that and
 
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
yes if I can prove that the tenant has
 
01:46:05.790 --> 01:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
you know is a drug dealer or has damaged
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
the property or something like that yeah
 
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
I can use that as a grounds but if other
 
01:46:15.030 --> 01:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
wi you know if there's nobody if PE if
 
01:46:16.750 --> 01:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
other people are afraid to say that the
 
01:46:18.990 --> 01:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
person's dealing drugs or afraid to say
 
01:46:21.229 --> 01:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
that they're that they're disturbing
 
01:46:23.070 --> 01:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
other tenants because they're afraid of
 
01:46:25.870 --> 01:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
what that tenant will do to them I I'm
 
01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to prove that and
 
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
so you know that will discourage me from
 
01:46:33.109 --> 01:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
renting to this person in the first
 
01:46:36.510 --> 01:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
place representative trip thank you Mr
 
01:46:38.589 --> 01:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you for taking my
 
01:46:38.599 --> 01:46:40.109 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you for taking my
question

01:46:40.109 --> 01:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:46:43.070 --> 01:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh if you have a
 
01:46:47.550 --> 01:46:47.560 align:start position:0%
lease is does that uh give
 
01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
the renter an expectation of a fixed
 
01:46:54.030 --> 01:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
monthly rental
 
01:46:56.430 --> 01:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
fee sure if you have a Le oh if you have
 
01:46:58.830 --> 01:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
a lease I mean you the lease would say
 
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know the rent is $500 a month or
 
01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
$1,000 a month or whatever so so if
 
01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
you're on a
 
01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
monthly uh I don't know what the proper
 
01:47:13.589 --> 01:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
term is uh uh rental is there an
 
01:47:15.870 --> 01:47:15.880 align:start position:0%
expectation that the the the rental fee
 
01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
will will not be
 
01:47:19.790 --> 01:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
increased no I would say if it's a if
 
01:47:22.109 --> 01:47:22.119 align:start position:0%
it's a month to month I would say
 
01:47:25.070 --> 01:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
probably not that you you know the the
 
01:47:28.589 --> 01:47:28.599 align:start position:0%
rent could I I could be could be
 
01:47:33.149 --> 01:47:33.159 align:start position:0%
increased um but you know I mean you
 
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
might you might have some expectation
 
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
that at least for some period of time
 
01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0%
Beyond a month that you know the rent
 
01:47:41.070 --> 01:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
would stay the same I would think it
 
01:47:46.629 --> 01:47:46.639 align:start position:0%
would be you know pretty unusual for in
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
a month to month for the like at the end
 
01:47:50.109 --> 01:47:50.119 align:start position:0%
of the first month that the landlord
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
said says well you know the rent's now
 
01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
gone up 10% uh I'm not saying that
 
01:47:57.149 --> 01:47:57.159 align:start position:0%
legally that couldn't happen but I think
 
01:47:59.790 --> 01:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
it would be unusual so so if you were
 
01:48:03.390 --> 01:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
going from a from a from a a oh excuse
 
01:48:05.390 --> 01:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
follow followup
 
01:48:08.830 --> 01:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
sorry so if you're going from a from a a
 
01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
a fixed term lease to a month-to-month
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
lease is would uh would there be some
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
expectation that the uh the uh the
 
01:48:20.430 --> 01:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
rental fee could increase oh sure yes I
 
01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
mean I you know that I think generally
 
01:48:24.070 --> 01:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
the law is putting putting putting this
 
01:48:25.790 --> 01:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
whole thing aside I think generally the
 
01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:28.639 align:start position:0%
law is that if you know if you have a
 
01:48:30.669 --> 01:48:30.679 align:start position:0%
lease for a year let's say and the and
 
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
it was $500 a month in my example at the
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
at the end of the term if neither party
 
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
says really says anything but the tenant
 
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
continues to live there um that then
 
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
that converts from a from a one-year
 
01:48:49.950 --> 01:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
lease to a month-to-month teny tency and
 
01:48:53.189 --> 01:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
it it sort of continues until one party
 
01:48:55.629 --> 01:48:55.639 align:start position:0%
or the other changes it so the landlord
 
01:48:57.629 --> 01:48:57.639 align:start position:0%
might say at the end of the year okay
 
01:48:59.470 --> 01:48:59.480 align:start position:0%
you know you've in you you sort of are
 
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
still here um from now you know now the
 
01:49:06.669 --> 01:49:06.679 align:start position:0%
the rent goes up to $550 a month and the
 
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
Tenant can take that or leave it if the
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
tenant doesn't like it tenant can leave
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you very
 
01:49:17.149 --> 01:49:17.159 align:start position:0%
much representative tur thanks thanks
 
01:49:19.470 --> 01:49:19.480 align:start position:0%
for taking the question I my question is
 
01:49:21.070 --> 01:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
sort of a technical going around the
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case itself um was it that
 
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
the lease sort of just had an end date
 
01:49:30.270 --> 01:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
on it and they said you couldn't prcl
 
01:49:32.750 --> 01:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
you couldn't terminate someone because
 
01:49:34.990 --> 01:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
essentially just the lease ended and I
 
01:49:37.109 --> 01:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
guess the question I'm wondering is did
 
01:49:39.070 --> 01:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court case state that you
 
01:49:42.189 --> 01:49:42.199 align:start position:0%
couldn't put a clause in a lease that
 
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
sort of stated that both parties agree
 
01:49:47.589 --> 01:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
that it would not continue um beyond
 
01:49:49.950 --> 01:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
that or I guess I'm trying to Wonder
 
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
Could could this be handled in the
 
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
language of a of a lease contract versus
 
01:49:58.229 --> 01:49:58.239 align:start position:0%
a a legal thing where both parties have
 
01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
consented to that I I think the answer
 
01:50:04.830 --> 01:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
to that is is no in in in this in this
 
01:50:08.350 --> 01:50:08.360 align:start position:0%
sense and and let me let me say as I as
 
01:50:11.950 --> 01:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
I recall from that case um you know
 
01:50:15.550 --> 01:50:15.560 align:start position:0%
there was a the the least term was I I
 
01:50:18.669 --> 01:50:18.679 align:start position:0%
think it was a year but um I I don't
 
01:50:22.189 --> 01:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
remember but in words in some sense the
 
01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
parties because the lease term said this
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
lease is valid for one year from you
 
01:50:30.149 --> 01:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
know whatever date to whatever date the
 
01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
the parties I think the parties had
 
01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
already agreed to what you know and in
 
01:50:37.629 --> 01:50:37.639 align:start position:0%
the tenant and had already agreed that
 
01:50:40.790 --> 01:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
this is the term of the lease so I mean
 
01:50:43.189 --> 01:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're saying
 
01:50:47.430 --> 01:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
could could the parties in that
 
01:50:51.310 --> 01:50:51.320 align:start position:0%
situation draft a lease that said is you
 
01:50:53.310 --> 01:50:53.320 align:start position:0%
know this this leases for one year and
 
01:50:56.510 --> 01:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
we really mean it um that you know and
 
01:50:59.390 --> 01:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
I'm and I'm and
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
and and I I as a
 
01:51:05.709 --> 01:51:05.719 align:start position:0%
tenant understand that there's a Supreme
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
Court's decision that says that the
 
01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
landlord can't let me can't force me to
 
01:51:12.990 --> 01:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
leave if I don't want to leave but I
 
01:51:15.550 --> 01:51:15.560 align:start position:0%
wave my rights under that Supreme Court
 
01:51:20.189 --> 01:51:20.199 align:start position:0%
decision you know I I I don't know uh I
 
01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
suspect if the theory that if
 
01:51:26.510 --> 01:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
the the people who wrote that Supreme
 
01:51:28.189 --> 01:51:28.199 align:start position:0%
Court decision and I have to say it was
 
01:51:31.870 --> 01:51:31.880 align:start position:0%
not me for sure it was long before me um
 
01:51:34.550 --> 01:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
the uh I think the argument would be
 
01:51:36.069 --> 01:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
that you can't do
 
01:51:39.470 --> 01:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
that that that would be just as bad for
 
01:51:41.669 --> 01:51:41.679 align:start position:0%
tenants you know they could be sort of
 
01:51:43.629 --> 01:51:43.639 align:start position:0%
coerced into signing that kind of a
 
01:51:46.030 --> 01:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
document too and it wouldn't and so it
 
01:51:47.950 --> 01:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't my suspicion is that that it
 
01:51:50.589 --> 01:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change anything but I I
 
01:51:52.830 --> 01:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
don't know that for
 
01:51:55.109 --> 01:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
sure representative
 
01:51:58.510 --> 01:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
Divine um thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question couldn't it
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
be possible that in the first lease say
 
01:52:08.830 --> 01:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
that you could have a contract with the
 
01:52:12.510 --> 01:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
tenant that said any rollover into a new
 
01:52:15.069 --> 01:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
lease the following year had a
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
stipulation that um a 10% or a 20%
 
01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
increase in the rent if they do not
 
01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
decide to provide
 
01:52:27.910 --> 01:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
that then they have maybe 30 days or
 
01:52:32.430 --> 01:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
whatever it is to you know end or
 
01:52:35.870 --> 01:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
terminate the original lease oh oh look
 
01:52:38.109 --> 01:52:38.119 align:start position:0%
no I mean there's no qu as why wouldn't
 
01:52:40.990 --> 01:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
you do that in the state to begin with
 
01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
instead of having this statute then well
 
01:52:49.109 --> 01:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
but I guess I mean you know one of the
 
01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
one of the things I have and I think I
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
said this last time one of the things I
 
01:52:55.310 --> 01:52:55.320 align:start position:0%
have to say candidly to to to to the
 
01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:58.109 align:start position:0%
have to say candidly to to to to the
committee

01:52:58.109 --> 01:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
is for a landlord who who wants to get
 
01:53:04.350 --> 01:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
rid of a
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
tenant there you know is there a way to
 
01:53:09.069 --> 01:53:09.079 align:start position:0%
do that sure the landlord can just at
 
01:53:11.310 --> 01:53:11.320 align:start position:0%
the end of the year can just up the rent
 
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
and and and failure to pay the new rent
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
will be a grounds for for for evicting
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
the tenant um so
 
01:53:23.350 --> 01:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
you know there there is there are I'm
 
01:53:25.310 --> 01:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
not saying that there aren't other ways
 
01:53:28.350 --> 01:53:28.360 align:start position:0%
to do that but I guess the real my real
 
01:53:30.149 --> 01:53:30.159 align:start position:0%
problem is with this is do you really
 
01:53:32.350 --> 01:53:32.360 align:start position:0%
want to do that do you want to say to a
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
landlord you know do you if you want to
 
01:53:38.030 --> 01:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
if you want to get rid of this tenant
 
01:53:39.870 --> 01:53:39.880 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason you can do it just
 
01:53:42.589 --> 01:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
up the rent and and if they and you know
 
01:53:44.709 --> 01:53:44.719 align:start position:0%
maybe you maybe you up it to something
 
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
that you know they can't afford and so
 
01:53:49.069 --> 01:53:49.079 align:start position:0%
then you've gotten rid of them I would
 
01:53:49.079 --> 01:53:50.510 align:start position:0%
then you've gotten rid of them I would
rather

01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
rather
 
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
you know I I I think that many land
 
01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
owners would not want to do that and
 
01:53:55.950 --> 01:53:55.960 align:start position:0%
that they would prefer they they would
 
01:53:57.790 --> 01:53:57.800 align:start position:0%
just prefer to be able to be honest with
 
01:53:59.430 --> 01:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
the tenant that you know we had a lease
 
01:54:01.990 --> 01:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
for a year the year's up and now I want
 
01:54:04.229 --> 01:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
you to go but but if but the short
 
01:54:05.709 --> 01:54:05.719 align:start position:0%
answer to your question is yes you could
 
01:54:09.390 --> 01:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
certainly change the the amount of the
 
01:54:12.790 --> 01:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
rent follow up uh wouldn't that just be
 
01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
give grounds for equal treatment to um
 
01:54:18.990 --> 01:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
the tenant if it's already stated in the
 
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
original cont contract that there is
 
01:54:24.229 --> 01:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
going to be an up and and you alleviate
 
01:54:27.189 --> 01:54:27.199 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing all you know a new
 
01:54:30.109 --> 01:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
law put into place it would alleviate it
 
01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
if the landlord already was upfront this
 
01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
is what's going to occur I'm giving you
 
01:54:39.390 --> 01:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
you know some leeway here um and already
 
01:54:42.510 --> 01:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
had it in the original lease that when
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
it comes up to a year up this is what's
 
01:54:47.550 --> 01:54:47.560 align:start position:0%
going to happen the rent is going to go
 
01:54:50.589 --> 01:54:50.599 align:start position:0%
up 20% there's no question about that
 
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
and then it'll continue say they stay
 
01:54:53.950 --> 01:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
for another year after that it's going
 
01:54:55.830 --> 01:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
to go up another percentage or it goes
 
01:54:59.950 --> 01:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
up gradually and if the tenant already
 
01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:01.629 align:start position:0%
up gradually and if the tenant already
knows

01:55:01.629 --> 01:55:01.639 align:start position:0%
knows
 
01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
that that's how it's going to proceed
 
01:55:07.470 --> 01:55:07.480 align:start position:0%
then it gives them some power to say you
 
01:55:08.790 --> 01:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
know what I don't want my rent I'm going
 
01:55:10.629 --> 01:55:10.639 align:start position:0%
to look around for another place or
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
whatever in the meantime and have that
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
conversation with the landlord instead
 
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
of something that is okay just based on
 
01:55:21.870 --> 01:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
power power of the landlord having the
 
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
power to you know say okay you're out I
 
01:55:27.669 --> 01:55:27.679 align:start position:0%
don't want to deal with you anymore
 
01:55:27.679 --> 01:55:28.629 align:start position:0%
don't want to deal with you anymore
there

01:55:28.629 --> 01:55:28.639 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
are it just seems to me that it would be
 
01:55:33.870 --> 01:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
more equal if it was already stated in
 
01:55:36.589 --> 01:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
the lease these things are going to
 
01:55:39.550 --> 01:55:39.560 align:start position:0%
occur and then you wouldn't need this
 
01:55:41.470 --> 01:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
and if we already can do
 
01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:44.639 align:start position:0%
that in this state why would we need
 
01:55:44.639 --> 01:55:46.069 align:start position:0%
that in this state why would we need
this

01:55:46.069 --> 01:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
law I guess I'm I'm not I'm not sure
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
that I that I completely understand what
 
01:55:55.470 --> 01:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
you're getting at I mean it's the you if
 
01:55:57.149 --> 01:55:57.159 align:start position:0%
if you're asking could you draw could
 
01:56:00.149 --> 01:56:00.159 align:start position:0%
you draft a lease that said as an
 
01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
example the rent is $500 it's a year's
 
01:56:04.069 --> 01:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
lease the rent is $500 a month for a
 
01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
year after the years over the rent goes
 
01:56:10.189 --> 01:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
up 20% and to use your example you
 
01:56:13.149 --> 01:56:13.159 align:start position:0%
certainly you could draw a lease that
 
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:21.589 --> 01:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
what what I would
 
01:56:24.109 --> 01:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
be what I would be concerned about is
 
01:56:27.149 --> 01:56:27.159 align:start position:0%
presumably if in in the thing that I'm
 
01:56:30.589 --> 01:56:30.599 align:start position:0%
sort of the thing that I'm worried about
 
01:56:32.830 --> 01:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
is not discouraging landlords from
 
01:56:35.550 --> 01:56:35.560 align:start position:0%
renting to people that that the landlord
 
01:56:36.870 --> 01:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
may have questions about whether they're
 
01:56:41.229 --> 01:56:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:44.870 --> 01:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
so if if I was going to use the solution
 
01:56:48.109 --> 01:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
that you propose to to to sort of
 
01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
alleviate that concern
 
01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
then I would want to make sure that what
 
01:56:55.109 --> 01:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
I said the rent was going to go up to at
 
01:56:58.350 --> 01:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
the end of a year was a was a pretty big
 
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
amount that I was pretty sure the tenant
 
01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to make because if
 
01:57:05.709 --> 01:57:05.719 align:start position:0%
because if I you know if if the rent
 
01:57:08.830 --> 01:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
only went up 5% let's
 
01:57:11.149 --> 01:57:11.159 align:start position:0%
say the tenant might very well be able
 
01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
to pay that and if I and if my concern
 
01:57:15.629 --> 01:57:15.639 align:start position:0%
at the beginning was I want to be able
 
01:57:19.709 --> 01:57:19.719 align:start position:0%
to make sure I can end this lease if the
 
01:57:22.350 --> 01:57:22.360 align:start position:0%
if my worst fears are are
 
01:57:24.750 --> 01:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
met I probably wouldn't want to do that
 
01:57:26.270 --> 01:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
because I wouldn't you know the fact
 
01:57:28.510 --> 01:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
that the tenant is paying 5%
 
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:32.639 align:start position:0%
more if it's still if if he or she is
 
01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
still you know dealing drugs
 
01:57:43.149 --> 01:57:43.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:47.109 --> 01:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:50.270 --> 01:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
katab to kind of follow on rep divine's
 
01:57:52.390 --> 01:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
question would you think that if you did
 
01:57:54.270 --> 01:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
such a thing as saying standardly that
 
01:57:56.510 --> 01:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to increase your rent by 20%
 
01:57:59.109 --> 01:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
or whatever number it may be that then
 
01:58:01.229 --> 01:58:01.239 align:start position:0%
that would also C encourage tenants who
 
01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
are really good tenants that the
 
01:58:05.669 --> 01:58:05.679 align:start position:0%
landlord may also want to stay to then
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
leave because they think that their
 
01:58:09.069 --> 01:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
rent's going to go up by 20% would you
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
think that that would happen sure I mean
 
01:58:13.069 --> 01:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
I that's I think that's a I think that's
 
01:58:16.390 --> 01:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
a you know exactly if you if you uh if
 
01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
you have a tenant I mean if you if you
 
01:58:23.950 --> 01:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
don't no I guess you you know you you
 
01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
could do that you could have I suppose
 
01:58:27.709 --> 01:58:27.719 align:start position:0%
you could have that Clause that says you
 
01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
know I'm going to raise it by 20% but as
 
01:58:31.830 --> 01:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative K points out you're gonna
 
01:58:34.709 --> 01:58:34.719 align:start position:0%
you may then discourage people
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
01:58:39.709 --> 01:58:39.719 align:start position:0%
gon thank you for taking my question if
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
the expiration of a lease is not
 
01:58:43.790 --> 01:58:43.800 align:start position:0%
enforcable then how is any other
 
01:58:46.750 --> 01:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
provision of a contract enforcable
 
01:58:48.390 --> 01:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
regardless of what you put into that
 
01:58:51.550 --> 01:58:51.560 align:start position:0%
contract how do you enforce
 
01:58:54.629 --> 01:58:54.639 align:start position:0%
anything that's that's my problem I mean
 
01:58:56.510 --> 01:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
as I I think you pointed out the last
 
01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
time you know in this case Justice Netto
 
01:59:03.149 --> 01:59:03.159 align:start position:0%
not Tina Netto Joe Netto who was my the
 
01:59:04.589 --> 01:59:04.599 align:start position:0%
first Chief Justice of Superior Court
 
01:59:05.870 --> 01:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
when I was there and then went on to the
 
01:59:09.189 --> 01:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court um you know an appointee
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
of Governor Shaheen hardly a sort of you
 
01:59:15.149 --> 01:59:15.159 align:start position:0%
know property rights Advocate that is
 
01:59:18.910 --> 01:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
you know uh right-wing person he wrote a
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
concur opinion saying this basically
 
01:59:24.149 --> 01:59:24.159 align:start position:0%
saying this is crazy we've we've we've
 
01:59:27.870 --> 01:59:27.880 align:start position:0%
basically told uh uh We've basically
 
01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
overrule this the contractual provision
 
01:59:34.589 --> 01:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
saying that uh a a a year a year's lease
 
01:59:38.470 --> 01:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
is a year's lease um and and uh he he
 
01:59:40.229 --> 01:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
concurred rather than dissented because
 
01:59:41.910 --> 01:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
there were some procedural issues in the
 
01:59:46.470 --> 01:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
case um that that he felt merited you
 
01:59:50.109 --> 01:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
know merited that the that uh him going
 
01:59:52.189 --> 01:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
along with the majority on the on the
 
01:59:54.510 --> 01:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
bottom line but uh in terms of the
 
01:59:56.510 --> 01:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
reasoning he said this this just doesn't
 
01:59:59.550 --> 01:59:59.560 align:start position:0%
make any sense and I agree it doesn't
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you if I remember
 
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
correctly another issue that came up
 
02:00:08.350 --> 02:00:08.360 align:start position:0%
last time was the 30 days in advance
 
02:00:10.149 --> 02:00:10.159 align:start position:0%
that seems to be in in in all these
 
02:00:13.470 --> 02:00:13.480 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant bills 30 days seems to
 
02:00:15.589 --> 02:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
not be enough time and I can agree with
 
02:00:18.189 --> 02:00:18.199 align:start position:0%
that um and I thought on several other
 
02:00:19.709 --> 02:00:19.719 align:start position:0%
bills that we had talked about it being
 
02:00:23.830 --> 02:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
60 days uh if we amended this to be uh
 
02:00:26.069 --> 02:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
providing the tenant with 60 days
 
02:00:27.990 --> 02:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
advanced notice that gives a lot more
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
time to for that uh tenant to
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
find adequate housing afterward would
 
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
you be that I have no problem with that
 
02:00:38.470 --> 02:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
at all no problem with that at
 
02:00:40.390 --> 02:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
all any other questions for
 
02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:41.790 align:start position:0%

02:01:22.830 --> 02:01:22.840 align:start position:0%
it last year I opposed it the year
 
02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
before um in current New Hampshire law a
 
02:01:28.310 --> 02:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
landlord cannot evict a tenant without a
 
02:01:31.790 --> 02:01:31.800 align:start position:0%
reason legally that means no eviction in
 
02:01:36.189 --> 02:01:36.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire without just cause if HB
 
02:01:39.149 --> 02:01:39.159 align:start position:0%
11115 passes the bill would allow a
 
02:01:41.709 --> 02:01:41.719 align:start position:0%
landlord to EV evict tenants in good
 
02:01:44.189 --> 02:01:44.199 align:start position:0%
standing for no reason at all and
 
02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
through no fault of the tenant merely
 
02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
that the landlord wants to take
 
02:01:50.629 --> 02:01:50.639 align:start position:0%
possession of the apartment at the
 
02:01:53.149 --> 02:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
expiration of the lease term this would
 
02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
be a no fault eviction right now New
 
02:01:59.390 --> 02:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law is only allow at fault
 
02:02:01.669 --> 02:02:01.679 align:start position:0%
evictions this happens when a tenant has
 
02:02:03.229 --> 02:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
violated the lease agreement and the
 
02:02:06.030 --> 02:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
landlord wants the tenant to move the
 
02:02:08.189 --> 02:02:08.199 align:start position:0%
landlord must file the eviction case in
 
02:02:10.910 --> 02:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
a Ser court system the tenant has a
 
02:02:12.830 --> 02:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
right to a fair trial in court in in
 
02:02:15.270 --> 02:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
front of a judge with New Hampshire's
 
02:02:17.629 --> 02:02:17.639 align:start position:0%
housing shortage these no faal evictions
 
02:02:20.109 --> 02:02:20.119 align:start position:0%
would increase housing insecurity and
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
homelessness if passed HB 11115 would
 
02:02:26.550 --> 02:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
displace families and create crisis
 
02:02:29.149 --> 02:02:29.159 align:start position:0%
displacement could disrupt a CH

Arrangements in the parents commute to
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
work I'm going to quote from the case
 
02:02:37.870 --> 02:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
that we were talking about earlier it's
 
02:02:43.550 --> 02:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
Amco versus casha ztz and that is the
 
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:51.229 --> 02:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
statute were the expiration of a lease
 
02:02:51.239 --> 02:02:52.430 align:start position:0%
statute were the expiration of a lease
to

02:02:52.430 --> 02:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:02:56.910 --> 02:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
con to constitu good cause then tenants
 
02:02:59.229 --> 02:02:59.239 align:start position:0%
could be evicted arbitarily from their
 
02:03:02.069 --> 02:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
home through no fault of their own such
 
02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
evictions as the legislature undoubtedly
 
02:03:07.629 --> 02:03:07.639 align:start position:0%
realized creat substantial hardships for
 
02:03:10.069 --> 02:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
tenants at Worst Tenants may become
 
02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
homeless as a result even when another
 
02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
residence is procured the tenant must
 
02:03:16.750 --> 02:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
hear the bear the expenses and
 
02:03:19.390 --> 02:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
inconveniences of moving relationships
 
02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
with friends and neighbors may be
 
02:03:22.990 --> 02:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
disrupted children may be forced into
 
02:03:25.589 --> 02:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
new school districts and local services
 
02:03:27.310 --> 02:03:27.320 align:start position:0%
and support systems for elderly and
 
02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
disabled tenants may be lost such a
 
02:03:31.470 --> 02:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
result would be contrary to what the
 
02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:32.950 align:start position:0%
result would be contrary to what the
legislator

02:03:32.950 --> 02:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
legislator
 
02:03:35.669 --> 02:03:35.679 align:start position:0%
intended furthermore were the mere
 
02:03:39.189 --> 02:03:39.199 align:start position:0%
experation of the lease to to constitute
 
02:03:41.189 --> 02:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
good cause for eviction it could enable
 
02:03:43.510 --> 02:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
landlords to evict when the true reason
 
02:03:46.589 --> 02:03:46.599 align:start position:0%
for eviction is illm motivated and I'll
 
02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
stop right there um
 
02:03:51.549 --> 02:03:51.559 align:start position:0%
so there were lots of questions earlier
 
02:03:51.559 --> 02:03:52.910 align:start position:0%
so there were lots of questions earlier
of

02:03:52.910 --> 02:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:03:56.470 --> 02:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
um representative Lynn when um he was at
 
02:03:59.870 --> 02:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
the podium one of the questions was
 
02:04:05.669 --> 02:04:05.679 align:start position:0%
about um well can you can you just write
 
02:04:09.549 --> 02:04:09.559 align:start position:0%
a lease that has a
 
02:04:12.030 --> 02:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
annual automatic rent
 
02:04:15.149 --> 02:04:15.159 align:start position:0%
increase oh yes you can
 
02:04:18.310 --> 02:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
but I feel that as a former landlord
 
02:04:20.950 --> 02:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
that you know I can I can write um a
 
02:04:24.870 --> 02:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
lease with a 20% increase you know each
 
02:04:28.030 --> 02:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
year but you know something as a landl
 
02:04:32.510 --> 02:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
my job is to make a profit and with
 
02:04:34.709 --> 02:04:34.719 align:start position:0%
20% I could be leaving money on the
 
02:04:37.270 --> 02:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
table especially if the rental market um
 
02:04:40.549 --> 02:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
goes up or the rental expenses go up um
 
02:04:44.030 --> 02:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
so that's just one of the questions um
 
02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
I'm ready for questions if anyone has
 
02:04:46.870 --> 02:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
any thank
 
02:04:50.589 --> 02:04:50.599 align:start position:0%
you any questions for representative D
 
02:04:53.149 --> 02:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo um I guess I actually have one
 
02:04:55.149 --> 02:04:55.159 align:start position:0%
representative what about in a situation
 
02:04:58.229 --> 02:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
of a uh landlord like in the Sea Coast
 
02:05:00.510 --> 02:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
or Lakes Region that rents uh vacation
 
02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
rentals and then they enter into a uh a
 
02:05:05.709 --> 02:05:05.719 align:start position:0%
winter rental say from October to March
 
02:05:07.470 --> 02:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me October to May that's eight
 
02:05:10.990 --> 02:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
months um would a lease like that be in
 
02:05:12.910 --> 02:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
contravention to the Supreme Court
 
02:05:15.069 --> 02:05:15.079 align:start position:0%
decision I mean both parties understand
 
02:05:16.750 --> 02:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
that it's an 8-month lease it's beyond
 
02:05:18.750 --> 02:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
the six-month what happens in that
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
situation I'm not a lawyer so I really
 
02:05:23.109 --> 02:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
couldn't tell you but my gut is that
 
02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
that would be a different type of
 
02:05:29.109 --> 02:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
property it would be non-restricted
 
02:05:32.589 --> 02:05:32.599 align:start position:0%
property okay very
 
02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
good representative orgon
 
02:05:39.549 --> 02:05:39.559 align:start position:0%
um we've been um because the prime
 
02:05:41.189 --> 02:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor is telling a lot about eviction
 
02:05:42.910 --> 02:05:42.920 align:start position:0%
is a way to get rid of somebody you
 
02:05:45.069 --> 02:05:45.079 align:start position:0%
don't want your property but is there
 
02:05:47.470 --> 02:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
anything is there anything in the law I
 
02:05:51.629 --> 02:05:51.639 align:start position:0%
mean I or that forbids you from you know
 
02:05:53.589 --> 02:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
doing the opposite and incentivizing the
 
02:05:55.990 --> 02:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
Tenant to leave the property like
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
offering them enough of an inducement so
 
02:06:01.189 --> 02:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
they'll be willing to leave voluntarily
 
02:06:03.629 --> 02:06:03.639 align:start position:0%
and although I suppose that's not quite
 
02:06:05.069 --> 02:06:05.079 align:start position:0%
as practical in the current housing
 
02:06:07.069 --> 02:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
market where it's very much sellers
 
02:06:08.510 --> 02:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
market and there's virtually no
 
02:06:11.189 --> 02:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
inventory and the prices are so high but
 
02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
there isn't anything legally that would
 
02:06:14.549 --> 02:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
forbid you from actually incentivizing
 
02:06:16.270 --> 02:06:16.280 align:start position:0%
somebody who you want to get rid of to
 
02:06:18.350 --> 02:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
leave voluntarily is there excellent
 
02:06:20.669 --> 02:06:20.679 align:start position:0%
question know there is not um AAR
 
02:06:23.189 --> 02:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
against incentivizing urging someone to
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
move in fact um uh in my career I have I
 
02:06:29.430 --> 02:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
had um paid people to move because they
 
02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
were nuisances or dealing drugs or and
 
02:06:33.629 --> 02:06:33.639 align:start position:0%
we couldn't you know we couldn't get
 
02:06:37.069 --> 02:06:37.079 align:start position:0%
them out then you know $500 uh if you
 
02:06:39.990 --> 02:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
move and they took it so that was a
 
02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.069 align:start position:0%
move and they took it so that was a
great

02:06:42.069 --> 02:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
great
 
02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
question representative Perez you made a
 
02:06:47.229 --> 02:06:47.239 align:start position:0%
comment you incentivizes them because
 
02:06:49.470 --> 02:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
you couldn't get them out my biggest
 
02:06:51.470 --> 02:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
concern with this and I looked up the
 
02:06:53.750 --> 02:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
definition of lease agreements and lease
 
02:06:56.870 --> 02:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
and this and in other states as well you
 
02:07:00.629 --> 02:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
own the property right that's my biggest
 
02:07:04.030 --> 02:07:04.040 align:start position:0%
concern and I also called the
 
02:07:06.069 --> 02:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
registry last year I didn't call them
 
02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
again this year there are a lot of
 
02:07:12.189 --> 02:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
people that are turning their Apartments
 
02:07:15.910 --> 02:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
into condos to get out of this situation
 
02:07:17.669 --> 02:07:17.679 align:start position:0%
which is only hurting the housing market
 
02:07:20.549 --> 02:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
have you heard of that happening at all
 
02:07:22.510 --> 02:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
uh not
 
02:07:24.229 --> 02:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
generally thank
 
02:07:26.109 --> 02:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for
 
02:07:27.310 --> 02:07:27.320 align:start position:0%
representative D
 
02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo seeing none thank you thank
 
02:07:44.549 --> 02:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:47.709 --> 02:07:47.719 align:start position:0%
Kyer thank you Mr chair for the record
 
02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
my name is John Ker I live in New Market
 
02:07:52.270 --> 02:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
uh and I oppose this bill the current
 
02:07:55.470 --> 02:07:55.480 align:start position:0%
rental vacancy rate is.
 
02:07:57.470 --> 02:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
6% that means someone looking for an
 
02:07:58.750 --> 02:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
apartment it's going to take them
 
02:08:02.030 --> 02:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
several months uh our state is about 30%
 
02:08:03.990 --> 02:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
renters my town in New Market is
 
02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%
actually 50% renters I own a small
 
02:08:09.750 --> 02:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
restaurant and a number actually all of
 
02:08:12.109 --> 02:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
my employees rent and a number of them
 
02:08:14.830 --> 02:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
actually walk to work because they live
 
02:08:17.109 --> 02:08:17.119 align:start position:0%
right down the road uh they do not own
 
02:08:20.030 --> 02:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
cars in fact most a lot of them and I'm
 
02:08:21.790 --> 02:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
just concerned that if this legislation
 
02:08:24.790 --> 02:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
were to pass uh it could disrupt their
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
lives if they could not find housing in
 
02:08:30.189 --> 02:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
a close proximity to the restaurant um
 
02:08:31.390 --> 02:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
also some of them have kids in the
 
02:08:33.870 --> 02:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
school system and I feel like their
 
02:08:36.390 --> 02:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
lives could be negatively affected by
 
02:08:38.270 --> 02:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
this legislation thank you I'll take
 
02:08:40.350 --> 02:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
questions if anyone has any
 
02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:41.510 align:start position:0%
questions if anyone has any
representative

02:08:41.510 --> 02:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:08:45.589 --> 02:08:45.599 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you um do you have
 
02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
difficulty in finding enough
 
02:08:53.270 --> 02:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh staff to employ uh yes it's been hard
 
02:08:54.950 --> 02:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
I got a good crew right now it's gotten
 
02:08:56.350 --> 02:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
a lot better in the
 
02:08:59.390 --> 02:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
last six months but prior to that it was
 
02:09:01.310 --> 02:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
it was really hard so I I have a really
 
02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
good crew right now and I want to keep
 
02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
them so I want them to be able to stay
 
02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:09.510 --> 02:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
Apartments representative
 
02:09:12.030 --> 02:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
gon thank you for taking my
 
02:09:16.189 --> 02:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
question do you know of any tenants that
 
02:09:20.629 --> 02:09:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:25.470 --> 02:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
up uh I do not I mean I know after you
 
02:09:26.709 --> 02:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
know after the year when you're on the
 
02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
month to month it would be hard you know
 
02:09:30.910 --> 02:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
I mean presumably your your lease is
 
02:09:33.149 --> 02:09:33.159 align:start position:0%
going month to month after that so other
 
02:09:37.510 --> 02:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:40.870 --> 02:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
say any further questions for this
 
02:09:43.589 --> 02:09:43.599 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you thank you
 
02:09:47.310 --> 02:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:52.669 align:start position:0%
 
lame

02:09:52.669 --> 02:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:54.709 --> 02:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
hey my name is Brandon lay and I'm an
 
02:09:56.790 --> 02:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
organizer with rights and democracy uh
 
02:09:58.910 --> 02:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
seeing as we're 45 minutes behind time I
 
02:10:01.069 --> 02:10:01.079 align:start position:0%
want to skip my written testimony here
 
02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
um I actually think a lot of the
 
02:10:04.990 --> 02:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
arguments uh against this bill have
 
02:10:07.229 --> 02:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
actually already been said today um I
 
02:10:09.589 --> 02:10:09.599 align:start position:0%
think we've highlighted how many ways we
 
02:10:12.030 --> 02:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
can get rid of a tenant already under
 
02:10:14.030 --> 02:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
current New Hampshire law um we've
 
02:10:17.030 --> 02:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned representative D Lorenzo
 
02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned something called Cash for keys
 
02:10:22.149 --> 02:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
right we give you money you get
 
02:10:25.629 --> 02:10:25.639 align:start position:0%
out under current law there are many
 
02:10:27.270 --> 02:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
other ways of getting people out either
 
02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
through negotiating with them or through
 
02:10:31.709 --> 02:10:31.719 align:start position:0%
builtin Clauses in the lease and I want
 
02:10:34.470 --> 02:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
to give you my lease as an
 
02:10:36.910 --> 02:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
example when my lease expires in
 
02:10:39.830 --> 02:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
February my rent goes up by $1,000 a
 
02:10:42.669 --> 02:10:42.679 align:start position:0%
month month to month that is a provision
 
02:10:45.709 --> 02:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
in my lease that incentivizes me to
 
02:10:47.229 --> 02:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
resign my
 
02:10:49.870 --> 02:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
lease and this is what most reputable
 
02:10:49.880 --> 02:10:52.149 align:start position:0%
lease and this is what most reputable
landlords

02:10:52.149 --> 02:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
landlords
 
02:10:55.470 --> 02:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
do so if you can't negotiate with your
 
02:10:58.030 --> 02:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
tenant or you can't you know put in a
 
02:11:00.790 --> 02:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
clause ahead of time saying hey when
 
02:11:01.870 --> 02:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
this lease
 
02:11:04.350 --> 02:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
expires um you're going to pay an extra
 
02:11:06.430 --> 02:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
thousand bucks a month sorry I get very
 
02:11:09.870 --> 02:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
uh choked up right now so I'm just here
 
02:11:12.589 --> 02:11:12.599 align:start position:0%
because I care a lot and my pet peeve is
 
02:11:15.030 --> 02:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
people being put out on the streets and
 
02:11:17.390 --> 02:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
this law would make it easier to put
 
02:11:18.950 --> 02:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
people out on the streets it would
 
02:11:20.830 --> 02:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
destabilize tenants and it
 
02:11:23.310 --> 02:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
disincentivizes landlords from working
 
02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
with their tenants so I'll cut my
 
02:11:27.189 --> 02:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
testimony short I just want to send you
 
02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
some testimony about a landlord
 
02:11:30.709 --> 02:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
Manchester who is against this bill so
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative gon did you
 
02:11:39.149 --> 02:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:41.430 --> 02:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
question any questions for this witness
 
02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'm sorry representative De
 
02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:54.030 --> 02:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
no further questions you're excused
 
02:12:03.390 --> 02:12:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:07.030 --> 02:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
Peg um good morning and thank you for
 
02:12:09.270 --> 02:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
allowing me to testify my name is Jane
 
02:12:13.310 --> 02:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
ha and I live at 1573 Union Street in
 
02:12:15.790 --> 02:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I'm just testifying on my
 
02:12:17.709 --> 02:12:17.719 align:start position:0%
own behalf although I work with the
 
02:12:17.719 --> 02:12:18.629 align:start position:0%
own behalf although I work with the
group

02:12:18.629 --> 02:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
group
 
02:12:21.149 --> 02:12:21.159 align:start position:0%
called the Manchester housing Alliance
 
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
and um I really think like I'm opposed
 
02:12:26.950 --> 02:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
to this bill and it seems like a bill as
 
02:12:28.510 --> 02:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
many other people have said some of the
 
02:12:30.109 --> 02:12:30.119 align:start position:0%
problems it seems like a bill that's in
 
02:12:33.629 --> 02:12:33.639 align:start position:0%
search of a problem to solve because uh
 
02:12:36.750 --> 02:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
landlords already have the opportunity
 
02:12:40.990 --> 02:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
to um evict tenants you know if there's
 
02:12:43.149 --> 02:12:43.159 align:start position:0%
a problem and
 
02:12:45.950 --> 02:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
um I think that the sponsor of this bill
 
02:12:47.870 --> 02:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
has contradicted himself coming up with
 
02:12:49.310 --> 02:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
on unlikely
 
02:12:53.229 --> 02:12:53.239 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals for instance um first he
 
02:12:56.470 --> 02:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
said that you know if the tenant was a
 
02:12:58.109 --> 02:12:58.119 align:start position:0%
problem tenant because they were
 
02:13:00.629 --> 02:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
creating problems and noise for the
 
02:13:03.390 --> 02:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
other tenants but then he said well
 
02:13:04.950 --> 02:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
maybe those tenants will be afraid to
 
02:13:07.870 --> 02:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
actually officially complain I mean it's
 
02:13:09.310 --> 02:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
kind of one way or the other either you
 
02:13:10.910 --> 02:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
got the complaints and you had them
 
02:13:13.589 --> 02:13:13.599 align:start position:0%
write them down or you don't um we
 
02:13:15.750 --> 02:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
already have eviction for
 
02:13:19.390 --> 02:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
cause um we have a housing crisis as
 
02:13:21.629 --> 02:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
other people had said we have
 
02:13:26.549 --> 02:13:26.559 align:start position:0%
a 6% vacancy rate so it's going to cause
 
02:13:29.830 --> 02:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of disruption and I think that you
 
02:13:31.830 --> 02:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
know landlords own the property that's
 
02:13:33.709 --> 02:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
fine we allow them to make a profit on
 
02:13:36.430 --> 02:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
the property which they do but they're
 
02:13:38.430 --> 02:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
also part of the community and I think
 
02:13:43.149 --> 02:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
that they um they have to um participate
 
02:13:44.990 --> 02:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
in the social contract that we all
 
02:13:46.709 --> 02:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
participate in and be part of the
 
02:13:50.229 --> 02:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
community and not not exacerbate the
 
02:13:53.950 --> 02:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
housing crisis by uh having more
 
02:13:56.149 --> 02:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
evictions you know and as I said there's
 
02:13:58.270 --> 02:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
already the opportunity for eviction
 
02:14:00.470 --> 02:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
with appropriate cause so I just don't
 
02:14:04.350 --> 02:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
see why this bill is necessary at all
 
02:14:06.629 --> 02:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'll take
 
02:14:09.870 --> 02:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for this
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:24.229 align:start position:0%

02:14:24.229 --> 02:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:25.790 --> 02:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and members of the

02:14:29.310 --> 02:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire

State Commission on Aging the New
 
02:14:32.589 --> 02:14:32.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Commission on Aging was
 
02:14:34.750 --> 02:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
created during the 2019 legislative
 
02:14:36.790 --> 02:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
session to provide guidance to the

related to

aging the Commission on Aging advises
 
02:14:46.750 --> 02:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
against this uh bill as written um the
 
02:14:48.350 --> 02:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
commission feels that the rights the
 
02:14:51.229 --> 02:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
bill would give to landlords will have a
 
02:14:55.510 --> 02:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
disproportional harm um upon tenants the
 
02:14:57.109 --> 02:14:57.119 align:start position:0%
commission's interest in this bill is
 
02:14:59.830 --> 02:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
focused on of course older adults as
 
02:15:02.830 --> 02:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
well as the low- wage worker workers who
 
02:15:04.790 --> 02:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
um provide essential services to older
 
02:15:06.189 --> 02:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
adults in the
 
02:15:08.830 --> 02:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
state um the vacancy rate has already
 
02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
been talked about at at um 6% uh far too
 
02:15:16.629 --> 02:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
low to support a functional Market um
 
02:15:18.149 --> 02:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
those older adults living on fixed
 
02:15:19.790 --> 02:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
incomes relying heavily on Social
 
02:15:22.910 --> 02:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
Security are often priced out of housing
 
02:15:24.990 --> 02:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
at rates higher than the general
 
02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
population those with mobility issues
 
02:15:29.549 --> 02:15:29.559 align:start position:0%
also face hurdles the United States
 
02:15:32.109 --> 02:15:32.119 align:start position:0%
Census Bureau issued a report on in
 
02:15:35.270 --> 02:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
October 2023 that found that less than
 
02:15:37.830 --> 02:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
20% of housing stock in New England is
 
02:15:40.270 --> 02:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
age rity age rity means having a
 
02:15:42.109 --> 02:15:42.119 align:start position:0%
step-free entry and a bed and bath on
 
02:15:43.189 --> 02:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
the first
 
02:15:45.470 --> 02:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
floor in New Hampshire the percentage of
 
02:15:48.830 --> 02:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
people aged 65 to 74 with a disability
 
02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:49.709 align:start position:0%
people aged 65 to 74 with a disability
is

02:15:49.709 --> 02:15:49.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:15:53.189 --> 02:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
21% the percentage increases to 42% for
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
ages 75 and
 
02:15:58.350 --> 02:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
older I think that the the premise of
 
02:16:00.790 --> 02:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is really focusing on um
 
02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
tenants who might be bad actors and I
 
02:16:04.189 --> 02:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
just wonder about what are the
 
02:16:05.950 --> 02:16:05.960 align:start position:0%
protections for tenants against
 
02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
landlords who might be bad actors um I
 
02:16:10.910 --> 02:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
just wonder let let's say I'm renting a
 
02:16:14.109 --> 02:16:14.119 align:start position:0%
place I um experience a disability where
 
02:16:16.510 --> 02:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
I need some reasonable accommodations
 
02:16:18.189 --> 02:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
some grab bars put in perhaps or
 
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
something else as and and as a
 
02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:23.629 align:start position:0%
something else as and and as a
landlord

02:16:23.629 --> 02:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
landlord
 
02:16:26.229 --> 02:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh um I start to make those
 
02:16:27.629 --> 02:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
accommodations but I really don't feel
 
02:16:30.510 --> 02:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
like it what happens to that tenant
 
02:16:32.230 --> 02:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
that's where the disproportional harm
 
02:16:34.790 --> 02:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
comes in I'll end my testimony now given
 
02:16:37.629 --> 02:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
time uh and answer any questions thank
 
02:16:40.910 --> 02:16:40.920 align:start position:0%

from Dober New Hampshire I am a single
 
02:17:11.629 --> 02:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
disabled mom to an amazing son with
 
02:17:14.549 --> 02:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
special needs I actively participate in
 
02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
my community frequently using my voice
 
02:17:20.270 --> 02:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
to Champ housing and Disability Rights I
 
02:17:22.349 --> 02:17:22.359 align:start position:0%
testified against a similar Bill last
 
02:17:25.549 --> 02:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
year um emphasizing how its Passage
 
02:17:29.190 --> 02:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
would affect my son and myself um deemed
 
02:17:31.990 --> 02:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
model tenants for our prompt rent
 
02:17:35.349 --> 02:17:35.359 align:start position:0%
payments and property care um last year
 
02:17:37.150 --> 02:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
I shared the challenges I faced as a
 
02:17:40.589 --> 02:17:40.599 align:start position:0%
voucher holder in finding an apartment a
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
process that took a dating nine
 
02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
months securing a space felt like
 
02:17:48.589 --> 02:17:48.599 align:start position:0%
winning the lottery um unfortunately
 
02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
this year's housing circumstances are
 
02:17:53.309 --> 02:17:53.319 align:start position:0%
even more dire um if this bill is
 
02:17:55.589 --> 02:17:55.599 align:start position:0%
approved it will create an environment
 
02:17:58.190 --> 02:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
where I hesitate to voice concerns to my
 
02:18:01.030 --> 02:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
landlord fearing attention I'll be
 
02:18:03.389 --> 02:18:03.399 align:start position:0%
reluctant to request repairs and Live In
 
02:18:05.669 --> 02:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
Perpetual anxiety about the stability of
 
02:18:08.790 --> 02:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
our home if for any reason my landlord
 
02:18:10.990 --> 02:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
decides otherwise there will be no
 
02:18:13.469 --> 02:18:13.479 align:start position:0%
alternative for me homelessness will
 
02:18:16.309 --> 02:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
become an inevitable reality and with no
 
02:18:18.070 --> 02:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
available shelter space
 
02:18:20.429 --> 02:18:20.439 align:start position:0%
my only choice will be which parking lot
 
02:18:24.429 --> 02:18:24.439 align:start position:0%
to park my car in or makeshift home as
 
02:18:26.990 --> 02:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
an active Community member I engage with
 
02:18:30.230 --> 02:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
various organizations and committees um
 
02:18:33.270 --> 02:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
I have a letter that several of them
 
02:18:35.429 --> 02:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
have signed on to I'm not going to read
 
02:18:37.629 --> 02:18:37.639 align:start position:0%
the full thing because I've I'm giv
 
02:18:41.429 --> 02:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
youall copies um but it just stresses
 
02:18:44.830 --> 02:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
that the good cause requirement provides
 
02:18:47.589 --> 02:18:47.599 align:start position:0%
tenants peace of mind the simple
 
02:18:49.349 --> 02:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
complaint about an unsafe condition
 
02:18:51.230 --> 02:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
won't result in an eviction when their
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
lease expires it allows individuals and
 
02:18:55.750 --> 02:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
families to plan for their future
 
02:18:58.389 --> 02:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
maintain continuity in their lives and
 
02:19:00.270 --> 02:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
establish Roots within their communities
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
for more than one lease period at a time
 
02:19:05.790 --> 02:19:05.800 align:start position:0%
by taking away this crucial Safeguard
 
02:19:07.589 --> 02:19:07.599 align:start position:0%
the proposed bill would make it possible
 
02:19:10.309 --> 02:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
for property owners to upend the lives
 
02:19:13.270 --> 02:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
of renters frequently and without any
 
02:19:17.469 --> 02:19:17.479 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason and that it dis
 
02:19:19.309 --> 02:19:19.319 align:start position:0%
proportionately impacts lowincome
 
02:19:21.549 --> 02:19:21.559 align:start position:0%
individuals and marginalized communities
 
02:19:23.110 --> 02:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
such as older adults and those living
 
02:19:24.669 --> 02:19:24.679 align:start position:0%
with mental illness or other
 
02:19:26.950 --> 02:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
disabilities like
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
myself um so for these reasons um I urge
 
02:19:34.589 --> 02:19:34.599 align:start position:0%
to oppose this bill any
 
02:19:36.990 --> 02:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for this
 
02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:45.290 align:start position:0%

Cornell
 
02:19:51.190 --> 02:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
I have written testimony that I will
 
02:20:04.389 --> 02:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:06.910 --> 02:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
also good morning uh my name is Kirsten
 
02:20:08.670 --> 02:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
Cornell I am an attorney at New
 
02:20:10.950 --> 02:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistant and I'm here
 
02:20:14.910 --> 02:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
today uh to oppose this bill a lot of
 
02:20:17.550 --> 02:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
the uh a lot of what I was going to say
 
02:20:18.990 --> 02:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
has been said and I know we're short on
 
02:20:21.190 --> 02:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
time so I'll try to keep it to the
 
02:20:24.030 --> 02:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
points that haven't been mentioned um
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
the the requirement for good cause
 
02:20:28.710 --> 02:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
eviction so to be clear you can evict a
 
02:20:32.110 --> 02:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
tenant in New Hampshire for cause so for
 
02:20:33.670 --> 02:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
um things like a material lease
 
02:20:35.630 --> 02:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
violation a threat to health and safety
 
02:20:37.590 --> 02:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
things like that there's also a
 
02:20:39.590 --> 02:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
provision that allows a landlord to EV
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
for other good cause which includes any
 
02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
business or economic reason so
 
02:20:46.870 --> 02:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
essentially New Hampshire law just
 
02:20:48.870 --> 02:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
required that a landlord have some
 
02:20:51.790 --> 02:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
reason to evict a tenant this can also
 
02:20:53.349 --> 02:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
include taking the property off the
 
02:20:55.870 --> 02:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
market doing renovations such things
 
02:20:55.880 --> 02:20:57.190 align:start position:0%
market doing renovations such things
like

02:20:57.190 --> 02:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:21:00.510 --> 02:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
that I think that uh representative
 
02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
Divine came got to really the Crux of
 
02:21:06.950 --> 02:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
the issue in her question um about where
 
02:21:09.230 --> 02:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
she know she mentioned the matter of
 
02:21:11.190 --> 02:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
power and I think that at the end of the
 
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
day this bill is about trying to allow
 
02:21:17.309 --> 02:21:17.319 align:start position:0%
landlords to have more power and
 
02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
attendants to have
 
02:21:23.070 --> 02:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
less the decision that was referred to
 
02:21:24.550 --> 02:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
by representative
 
02:21:27.950 --> 02:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
Lynn noted that the reason that they did
 
02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
not believe that the mere conclusion of
 
02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
a lease term should constitute good
 
02:21:34.990 --> 02:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
cause was to balance the interests of
 
02:21:36.630 --> 02:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
property owners to control their
 
02:21:39.150 --> 02:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
properties as well as to protect tenants
 
02:21:41.790 --> 02:21:41.800 align:start position:0%
who are trying to access one of the most
 
02:21:44.389 --> 02:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
fundamental needs that all humans have
 
02:21:45.630 --> 02:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:21:47.910 --> 02:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
shelter um
 
02:21:50.309 --> 02:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
it's important to realize that un leas
 
02:21:52.750 --> 02:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
agreement is not a contract in the
 
02:21:54.670 --> 02:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
typical sense of the word it's not a
 
02:21:57.389 --> 02:21:57.399 align:start position:0%
situation where you know two or more
 
02:22:01.389 --> 02:22:01.399 align:start position:0%
parties come together and bargain to
 
02:22:05.070 --> 02:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
agree to terms that are uh beneficial
 
02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
across the board but in a landlord
 
02:22:09.910 --> 02:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
tenant relationship there's an unequal
 
02:22:11.830 --> 02:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
power Dynamic that doesn't allow that
 
02:22:14.110 --> 02:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
kind of bargaining that kind of
 
02:22:16.349 --> 02:22:16.359 align:start position:0%
negotiation what a residential lease
 
02:22:18.429 --> 02:22:18.439 align:start position:0%
amounts to a is what the law would call
 
02:22:20.150 --> 02:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
a contract of adhesion which is
 
02:22:22.790 --> 02:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
basically a form document that the
 
02:22:25.070 --> 02:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
landlord set the terms and the tenants
 
02:22:27.429 --> 02:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
can take it on either a take it or leave
 
02:22:27.439 --> 02:22:28.750 align:start position:0%
can take it on either a take it or leave
it

02:22:28.750 --> 02:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:22:31.510 --> 02:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
basis tenants don't sign six-month
 
02:22:34.389 --> 02:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
leases 12-month leases because they only
 
02:22:36.590 --> 02:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
intend to stay in these units for that
 
02:22:39.510 --> 02:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
long they sign them because they have to
 
02:22:41.270 --> 02:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
and because that's their option in order
 
02:22:44.150 --> 02:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
to access that fundamental
 
02:22:47.950 --> 02:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
need these are people's homes uh taking
 
02:22:50.670 --> 02:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
away the requirement of having cause for
 
02:22:53.230 --> 02:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
eviction creates a situation where only
 
02:22:55.150 --> 02:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
homeowners will be able to access the
 
02:22:57.710 --> 02:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
kind of housing stability that most of
 
02:23:00.309 --> 02:23:00.319 align:start position:0%
us take for granted it's been mentioned
 
02:23:04.230 --> 02:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
before that in order to uh keep kids in
 
02:23:06.750 --> 02:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
houses in the same schools in order for
 
02:23:08.830 --> 02:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
people to maintain employment all of
 
02:23:11.309 --> 02:23:11.319 align:start position:0%
these things turn on the ability to stay
 
02:23:13.349 --> 02:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
house and to stay in the same
 
02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
community in a housing crisis like the
 
02:23:17.750 --> 02:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
one we're facing right now where there
 
02:23:20.269 --> 02:23:20.279 align:start position:0%
was a 55% increase in homelessness
 
02:23:23.710 --> 02:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
between 2022 and 2023 which was the
 
02:23:25.230 --> 02:23:25.240 align:start position:0%
largest percentage increase in
 
02:23:28.510 --> 02:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
Nationwide an eviction is highly likely
 
02:23:31.070 --> 02:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
to result in some period of homelessness
 
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
and if not that displacement to a
 
02:23:35.510 --> 02:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
different part of the state where a
 
02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
family or an individual will have to
 
02:23:40.349 --> 02:23:40.359 align:start position:0%
begin to rebuild their
 
02:23:44.230 --> 02:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
lives beyond this this law allows
 
02:23:47.870 --> 02:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
landlords to essentially every every 6
 
02:23:51.150 --> 02:23:51.160 align:start position:0%
to 12 months not have to give a reason
 
02:23:53.670 --> 02:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
to evict a tenant which makes it easier
 
02:23:56.349 --> 02:23:56.359 align:start position:0%
to dodge fair housing laws because you
 
02:23:58.750 --> 02:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
don't have to state in tent it's harder
 
02:24:01.070 --> 02:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
to enforce anti-retaliation
 
02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
laws and also prevents people from or
 
02:24:07.990 --> 02:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps makes puts tenants in fear of
 
02:24:11.670 --> 02:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
speaking up as you heard marriages say
 
02:24:15.230 --> 02:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
about conditions issues which lowers and
 
02:24:17.030 --> 02:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
which lowers the quality of Housing and
 
02:24:19.030 --> 02:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and makes it harder to
 
02:24:22.510 --> 02:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
enforce the minimum housing
 
02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
standards we heard representative L
 
02:24:26.550 --> 02:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
suggest that at the end of the lease
 
02:24:29.070 --> 02:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
term you know tenants have all of you
 
02:24:31.670 --> 02:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
know they can say stay or go and that
 
02:24:33.710 --> 02:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
landlords have are stuck with that
 
02:24:36.590 --> 02:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
tenant with all due respect I have to
 
02:24:39.269 --> 02:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
disagree at the end of the lease term
 
02:24:41.269 --> 02:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
the relationship between the two parties
 
02:24:43.790 --> 02:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
stays roughly the same landlords can
 
02:24:46.510 --> 02:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
create the leas terms that they want
 
02:24:48.309 --> 02:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
they can change leasee terms they can
 
02:24:50.550 --> 02:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
increase the rent they can decide to
 
02:24:52.150 --> 02:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
renovate the property they could take it
 
02:24:54.510 --> 02:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
off the market they can do any number of
 
02:24:56.870 --> 02:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
things the only thing they cannot do is
 
02:24:58.950 --> 02:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
swap one tenant for another without a
 
02:25:01.710 --> 02:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason tenants on the other
 
02:25:04.070 --> 02:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
hand are still in a position where their
 
02:25:06.590 --> 02:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
only option is to take it or leave it
 
02:25:09.269 --> 02:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
and right now leaving it pretty much
 
02:25:12.309 --> 02:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
means leaving housing so I urge you to
 
02:25:14.950 --> 02:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
support tenants by opposing this bill
 
02:25:18.469 --> 02:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions the may
 
02:25:22.110 --> 02:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
have any any questions for this
 
02:25:24.630 --> 02:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
witness representa keny thank you Mr
 
02:25:25.630 --> 02:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
02:25:27.550 --> 02:25:27.560 align:start position:0%
question um so you somewhat touched on
 
02:25:29.670 --> 02:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
this at the end of your testimony uh we
 
02:25:32.389 --> 02:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
heard from the prime sponsor that a big
 
02:25:34.910 --> 02:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
reason uh he sees the need for this bill
 
02:25:37.710 --> 02:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
is because landlords uh will not want to
 
02:25:40.990 --> 02:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
take a risk on tenants um that they see
 
02:25:44.590 --> 02:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
as risky without this um without this
 
02:25:47.750 --> 02:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
in-law and that if they did have a
 
02:25:49.790 --> 02:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
reason for cause it would be hard to
 
02:25:51.389 --> 02:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
prove I just wanted to know if you had
 
02:25:55.110 --> 02:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
any input on that um I I think that in
 
02:25:56.710 --> 02:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
this housing market it's unlikely a
 
02:25:58.910 --> 02:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
landlord will be in a position to take a
 
02:26:00.510 --> 02:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
risk on any tenant they're going to have
 
02:26:03.070 --> 02:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
multiple applicants for any unit I think
 
02:26:04.750 --> 02:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
if we want to incentivize landlords we
 
02:26:07.389 --> 02:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
can look at bills like s SP
 
02:26:09.910 --> 02:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
518 um and there's there's a few others
 
02:26:11.910 --> 02:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
that are trying to create circumstances
 
02:26:15.469 --> 02:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
to incentivize landlords I think that if
 
02:26:18.269 --> 02:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
a if a landord does take a risk on a
 
02:26:20.910 --> 02:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
tenant and there's no reason to evict
 
02:26:22.870 --> 02:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
tenant to that tenant for cause under
 
02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
any of the provisions then that tenant
 
02:26:26.750 --> 02:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
has proved themselves and they shouldn't
 
02:26:30.870 --> 02:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
be subject to eviction I think that
 
02:26:33.070 --> 02:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
we've heard people say that it's you
 
02:26:36.190 --> 02:26:36.200 align:start position:0%
know they have to prove a for cause
 
02:26:38.269 --> 02:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
eviction and that's
 
02:26:41.590 --> 02:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
true but it shouldn't be easy to take
 
02:26:44.190 --> 02:26:44.200 align:start position:0%
away somebody's home it's reasonable to
 
02:26:46.990 --> 02:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
expect a landlord to use the lawful
 
02:26:49.469 --> 02:26:49.479 align:start position:0%
process of eviction and to prove that a
 
02:26:51.710 --> 02:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
tenant has done something wrong before
 
02:26:52.990 --> 02:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
they lose their
 
02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
housing um for more information about
 
02:26:59.070 --> 02:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
the reasons that uh landlord can evict I
 
02:27:02.870 --> 02:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
did send around the um the standard
 
02:27:05.190 --> 02:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
eviction form that's available uh on the
 
02:27:06.950 --> 02:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
Court's website so there's additional
 
02:27:09.469 --> 02:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
information about reasons for evicting
 
02:27:11.510 --> 02:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
there but um in short I think it's
 
02:27:13.269 --> 02:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
unlikely that a landlord will take a
 
02:27:15.790 --> 02:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
risk for that reason and I also think
 
02:27:19.550 --> 02:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
that it's reason to have to prove
 
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
cause any further
 
02:27:42.309 --> 02:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:45.190 --> 02:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
house good afternoon to the committee um
 
02:27:46.870 --> 02:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
my name is Alice house I'll keep this
 
02:27:49.150 --> 02:27:49.160 align:start position:0%
short I am I live in Durham New
 
02:27:51.950 --> 02:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I oppose Bill
 
02:27:54.230 --> 02:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
1115 um I believe if residents have not
 
02:27:55.950 --> 02:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
done anything wrong they should be given
 
02:27:58.070 --> 02:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to renew that lease housing
 
02:27:59.830 --> 02:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
is not just a product or service as
 
02:28:01.590 --> 02:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about but a matter of
 
02:28:03.950 --> 02:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
safety shelter and just because people
 
02:28:05.469 --> 02:28:05.479 align:start position:0%
are renting should not mean that that
 
02:28:08.190 --> 02:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
safety should be taken away from them um
 
02:28:09.910 --> 02:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
I have rented an apartment in Durham for
 
02:28:12.190 --> 02:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
the past several years being able to
 
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
renew my lease has allowed me to focus
 
02:28:16.269 --> 02:28:16.279 align:start position:0%
on my studies and on building Community
 
02:28:17.670 --> 02:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
with the people around me rather than
 
02:28:20.309 --> 02:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
having to look for a new place each year
 
02:28:22.309 --> 02:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
um as an out ofate student who doesn't
 
02:28:25.590 --> 02:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
have family to let me move um or to stay
 
02:28:28.630 --> 02:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
with if things get rough um and without
 
02:28:31.070 --> 02:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
access to a car consistently consistent
 
02:28:32.990 --> 02:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
housing is really critical and moving is
 
02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
a difficult task that has to be planned
 
02:28:37.429 --> 02:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
ahead for um so having to find a new
 
02:28:39.309 --> 02:28:39.319 align:start position:0%
place especially if it were for a
 
02:28:41.670 --> 02:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
shorter lease um would have caused me
 
02:28:43.230 --> 02:28:43.240 align:start position:0%
stress and possibly
 
02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
houselessness um and as we've been
 
02:28:46.910 --> 02:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
talking about because house housing is
 
02:28:48.550 --> 02:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
scarce in New Hampshire especially in
 
02:28:50.910 --> 02:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
Durham um my friends who have had to
 
02:28:52.910 --> 02:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
look for housing on short notice due to
 
02:28:56.230 --> 02:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
mold issues job changes Etc um have been
 
02:28:58.349 --> 02:28:58.359 align:start position:0%
very hard pressed to find anything in 30
 
02:29:00.269 --> 02:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
days some did not find anything in their
 
02:29:02.910 --> 02:29:02.920 align:start position:0%
price range and are um losing money by
 
02:29:06.269 --> 02:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
staying in Durham but they have to um so
 
02:29:08.190 --> 02:29:08.200 align:start position:0%
I just ask you not to put the option to
 
02:29:10.309 --> 02:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
evict People based on end of lease in
 
02:29:12.070 --> 02:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
the hands of landlords instead of
 
02:29:15.910 --> 02:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
renters um I also worry that it is
 
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
easier to raise rent with new tenants is
 
02:29:20.790 --> 02:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
they may not ask questions as to why
 
02:29:24.710 --> 02:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
that rent is going up um in a new lease
 
02:29:26.349 --> 02:29:26.359 align:start position:0%
this I saw this happen when I signed at
 
02:29:28.110 --> 02:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
my apartment and the only reason I knew
 
02:29:29.830 --> 02:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
that I had gone up is because I knew the
 
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
last people who lived there um the
 
02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
increase made sense but it wouldn't I
 
02:29:36.870 --> 02:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have known um that that was the
 
02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
case otherwise so I just worry that this
 
02:29:41.830 --> 02:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
bill especially in Durham if passed um
 
02:29:44.269 --> 02:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
could be used to get rid of tenants not
 
02:29:49.349 --> 02:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
for being a nuisance but just because um
 
02:29:53.269 --> 02:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
of like being able to raise rent prices
 
02:29:56.590 --> 02:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
or um other reasons other than what you
 
02:29:58.110 --> 02:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
already can get rid of a tenant for
 
02:30:00.190 --> 02:30:00.200 align:start position:0%
under the current laws so thank you very
 
02:30:01.870 --> 02:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
much for listening and I will take
 
02:30:04.870 --> 02:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for this
 
02:30:07.790 --> 02:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you thank you
 
02:30:15.429 --> 02:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:15.439 --> 02:30:25.750 align:start position:0%
 
Kremer

02:30:25.750 --> 02:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:27.630 --> 02:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
I got one copy for everyone but I can uh
 
02:30:29.670 --> 02:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
hand in the other one at the end as well
 
02:30:31.910 --> 02:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
um good morning my name is Ben Kramer I
 
02:30:33.790 --> 02:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
live in New Market um I'm organizing
 
02:30:34.830 --> 02:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
director with New Hampshire youth
 
02:30:37.030 --> 02:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
movement I represent an organization
 
02:30:38.790 --> 02:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
with a base of over 100 dedicated
 
02:30:40.910 --> 02:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
members and more than 5,000 supporters
 
02:30:43.950 --> 02:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
ages 15 to 30 across New Hampshire um
 
02:30:45.469 --> 02:30:45.479 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking today on behalf of young
 
02:30:47.630 --> 02:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters and as a renter myself
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
um as I testify opposition to this bill
 
02:30:52.790 --> 02:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
the real problem with this bill I think
 
02:30:54.070 --> 02:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
in addition to what everyone has said I
 
02:30:55.950 --> 02:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
just want to like underscore like the
 
02:30:57.349 --> 02:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
problem with this bill is it puts a
 
02:31:00.110 --> 02:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
trapo under every renter in the
 
02:31:02.750 --> 02:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
state that it's a lever that can be
 
02:31:04.950 --> 02:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
pulled at the end of their lease and
 
02:31:06.830 --> 02:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
then they have to scramble to find
 
02:31:08.710 --> 02:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
housing and I I just really want to
 
02:31:11.309 --> 02:31:11.319 align:start position:0%
underscore the reality of what that
 
02:31:14.110 --> 02:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
means if the trapo is pulled um for a
 
02:31:16.630 --> 02:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
renter particularly young renters but
 
02:31:19.110 --> 02:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
renters um in this day and age in this
 
02:31:21.590 --> 02:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
state so I think the the fact of the
 
02:31:23.150 --> 02:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
matter is under this bill the most
 
02:31:25.710 --> 02:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
likely scenario for someone unexpectedly
 
02:31:27.269 --> 02:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
evicted at the end of their lease
 
02:31:29.309 --> 02:31:29.319 align:start position:0%
because you do not need good reason
 
02:31:31.830 --> 02:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
under this law um the most likely
 
02:31:32.910 --> 02:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
scenario is that they experience
 
02:31:34.429 --> 02:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
homelessness for at least a short period
 
02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
of time um and just like think about
 
02:31:38.269 --> 02:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
everything that needs to go right in
 
02:31:40.590 --> 02:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
order to avoid being homeless first they
 
02:31:42.070 --> 02:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
need to be able to find new housing that
 
02:31:44.190 --> 02:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
they can afford that meets their needs
 
02:31:45.870 --> 02:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
and this is in a housing market with a
 
02:31:48.429 --> 02:31:48.439 align:start position:0%
6% vacancy rate as people of other of
 
02:31:50.429 --> 02:31:50.439 align:start position:0%
other people have said that's within 30
 
02:31:52.910 --> 02:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
days it took me three months of
 
02:31:54.990 --> 02:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
searching to find my current apartment
 
02:31:57.870 --> 02:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
this is difficult then they need to be
 
02:32:00.590 --> 02:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
able to afford first month's rent a
 
02:32:03.870 --> 02:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
deposit that's likely over
 
02:32:06.190 --> 02:32:06.200 align:start position:0%
$3,500 that's an upfront cost that's
 
02:32:07.710 --> 02:32:07.720 align:start position:0%
money that they need to have on hand and
 
02:32:09.269 --> 02:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
be able to spend at this moment people
 
02:32:10.750 --> 02:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
do not have that money I do not have
 
02:32:12.510 --> 02:32:12.520 align:start position:0%
that money the vast vast majority of
 
02:32:15.190 --> 02:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
Myers do not have that money and then if
 
02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
those two things go right they need to
 
02:32:17.550 --> 02:32:17.560 align:start position:0%
be able to actually move into this new
 
02:32:19.349 --> 02:32:19.359 align:start position:0%
place in time that's additional money
 
02:32:20.870 --> 02:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's additional time that people just
 
02:32:23.830 --> 02:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
don't have um so that's an extremely
 
02:32:25.790 --> 02:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
slim chance of avoiding homelessness
 
02:32:27.870 --> 02:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
right the most likely reality is when
 
02:32:29.190 --> 02:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
their 30 days are up they're left with
 
02:32:31.349 --> 02:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
nowhere else to go and I need to
 
02:32:32.550 --> 02:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
underscore the statistic as it's
 
02:32:34.349 --> 02:32:34.359 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking to me New Hampshire has
 
02:32:37.030 --> 02:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
the fastest rising rate of homelessness
 
02:32:40.309 --> 02:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
in the country 52% last year we' have a
 
02:32:42.830 --> 02:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
moral obligation to House people in the
 
02:32:45.790 --> 02:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
state and this bill puts in a trapo
 
02:32:47.070 --> 02:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
under people who are already in housing
 
02:32:48.870 --> 02:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
and want to stay in that housing for the
 
02:32:52.269 --> 02:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
long term it exacerbates that issue um
 
02:32:54.269 --> 02:32:54.279 align:start position:0%
finally I just need to underscore like
 
02:32:55.670 --> 02:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
I've been a renter since moving to the
 
02:32:57.630 --> 02:32:57.640 align:start position:0%
state almost 10 years ago the vast vast
 
02:32:59.590 --> 02:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
majority of young people are renters we
 
02:33:01.590 --> 02:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
need young people to stay in the state
 
02:33:02.469 --> 02:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
they are a
 
02:33:04.870 --> 02:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
future but we cannot stay here and we
 
02:33:06.389 --> 02:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
want to stay here we cannot stay here if
 
02:33:08.510 --> 02:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have stable housing here so
 
02:33:09.750 --> 02:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
this will drive young people out of our
 
02:33:10.830 --> 02:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
state we'll drive everyone out of our
 
02:33:12.670 --> 02:33:12.680 align:start position:0%
state or onto the streets and I think
 
02:33:14.389 --> 02:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
that's a reality that we can't
 
02:33:17.349 --> 02:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
accept um yeah I'll keep it to that I
 
02:33:19.190 --> 02:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
urge the committee um keep New Hampshire
 
02:33:20.349 --> 02:33:20.359 align:start position:0%
a state where we can count on housing
 
02:33:21.830 --> 02:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
for the long term make a future for
 
02:33:23.750 --> 02:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
ourselves um urge the committee to
 
02:33:25.150 --> 02:33:25.160 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill we'll take any
 
02:33:26.550 --> 02:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
questions if you have
 
02:33:30.110 --> 02:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
it any questions for this witness seeing
 
02:33:45.150 --> 02:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:45.160 --> 02:33:48.389 align:start position:0%
 
next

02:33:48.389 --> 02:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:50.830 --> 02:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Lee Heath and I oppose
 
02:33:50.840 --> 02:33:52.870 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Lee Heath and I oppose
Bill

02:33:52.870 --> 02:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
02:33:55.630 --> 02:33:55.640 align:start position:0%
1115 I am a student at the University of
 
02:33:58.230 --> 02:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I would like to share
 
02:34:01.710 --> 02:34:01.720 align:start position:0%
my story my mom was a single mom
 
02:34:04.910 --> 02:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
struggling multiple jobs we had to move
 
02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:06.150 align:start position:0%
struggling multiple jobs we had to move
Apartments

02:34:06.150 --> 02:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
Apartments
 
02:34:09.070 --> 02:34:09.080 align:start position:0%
frequently because single mothers have a
 
02:34:11.790 --> 02:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
disgustingly High eviction rate and I
 
02:34:12.990 --> 02:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
saw it
 
02:34:16.230 --> 02:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
firsthand landlords would dig for any
 
02:34:18.790 --> 02:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
excuse to get rid of just the two of us
 
02:34:21.230 --> 02:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
they lied we caught them bribing
 
02:34:24.990 --> 02:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
neighbors to submit complaints and even
 
02:34:26.790 --> 02:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
with the warning sometimes we wouldn't
 
02:34:28.990 --> 02:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
be able to find a place in time and
 
02:34:31.230 --> 02:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
would be on the streets in the alley
 
02:34:34.389 --> 02:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
behind whatever job she was currently
 
02:34:36.830 --> 02:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
working it
 
02:34:40.110 --> 02:34:40.120 align:start position:0%
um this is a horrible thing to be a
 
02:34:42.110 --> 02:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
homeless before the age of 10 with your
 
02:34:45.790 --> 02:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
mother while watching um the landlords
 
02:34:48.670 --> 02:34:48.680 align:start position:0%
get more money from the next
 
02:34:52.510 --> 02:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
tenant I trust me when I say no landlord
 
02:34:55.870 --> 02:34:55.880 align:start position:0%
needs it to be easier to make good
 
02:34:58.910 --> 02:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
working people and children homeless
 
02:35:02.670 --> 02:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
thank you I will be taking
 
02:35:04.510 --> 02:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for this
 
02:35:07.230 --> 02:35:07.240 align:start position:0%
individual this witness excuse me seeing
 
02:35:14.670 --> 02:35:14.680 align:start position:0%

the
 
02:35:20.590 --> 02:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
02:35:24.510 --> 02:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
Elliot Barry I'm here testifying myself
 
02:35:30.230 --> 02:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh on my own um on my own behalf for 47
 
02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:32.399 align:start position:0%
years I was an attorney at in Hampshire
 
02:35:36.790 --> 02:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
legal assistance and um probably had the
 
02:35:39.630 --> 02:35:39.640 align:start position:0%
honor of representing more tenants than
 
02:35:42.349 --> 02:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
anybody in New Hampshire history uh I've
 
02:35:44.190 --> 02:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
also had the opportunity I was the
 
02:35:48.190 --> 02:35:48.200 align:start position:0%
attorney who argued the Je case uh I
 
02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
have appeared before uh representative
 
02:35:53.870 --> 02:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
Lynn and always enjoyed it um but
 
02:35:55.469 --> 02:35:55.479 align:start position:0%
there're just a couple points that I'd
 
02:35:58.990 --> 02:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
like to go over uh that may not be clear
 
02:36:04.510 --> 02:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
in the in the case of um
 
02:36:07.269 --> 02:36:07.279 align:start position:0%
where it's been suggested that it's
 
02:36:11.590 --> 02:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
really so difficult to uh evict a tenant
 
02:36:13.830 --> 02:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
one thing that we should know number one
 
02:36:17.990 --> 02:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
last year alone over 3,600 tenants were
 
02:36:20.830 --> 02:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
actually evicted that's not the ones who
 
02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
left after they got the eviction notice
 
02:36:25.950 --> 02:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
it's not the ones who left after the uh
 
02:36:27.870 --> 02:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
eviction action was started that's just
 
02:36:30.150 --> 02:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
where a RIT of possession was issued
 
02:36:32.830 --> 02:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
over 3,600
 
02:36:36.110 --> 02:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
households in addition to that when it's
 
02:36:38.710 --> 02:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
not easy right when you when you have a
 
02:36:41.230 --> 02:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
behavior-based eviction if you look at
 
02:36:41.240 --> 02:36:42.710 align:start position:0%
behavior-based eviction if you look at
RSA

02:36:42.710 --> 02:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
02:36:46.990 --> 02:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
540 section 16 C you will see that there
 
02:36:50.429 --> 02:36:50.439 align:start position:0%
is a very clear hearsay exception uh
 
02:36:53.710 --> 02:36:53.720 align:start position:0%
that landlords can use to bring evidence
 
02:36:55.950 --> 02:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
of complaints against tenants that the
 
02:36:59.309 --> 02:36:59.319 align:start position:0%
landlord received uh on or near the time
 
02:37:02.150 --> 02:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
that they uh that the complaint was made
 
02:37:04.230 --> 02:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
and that is used regularly in The
 
02:37:06.870 --> 02:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
District in the district division so
 
02:37:08.830 --> 02:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
that landlords don't have to produce
 
02:37:12.469 --> 02:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
live testimony in many many Behavior P
 
02:37:14.670 --> 02:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
um behavior-based
 
02:37:19.429 --> 02:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
evictions um um I want to also point out
 
02:37:24.510 --> 02:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
that and remind the committee
 
02:37:28.190 --> 02:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
that in under the conventional the good
 
02:37:31.389 --> 02:37:31.399 align:start position:0%
cause law that we're talking about today
 
02:37:33.349 --> 02:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
not only are there all these reasons
 
02:37:36.349 --> 02:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
based on tenant fault but any legitimate
 
02:37:39.230 --> 02:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
business or economic reason can be the
 
02:37:40.630 --> 02:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
basis for an
 
02:37:43.190 --> 02:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
eviction contrast that with our
 
02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Park uh legislation
 
02:37:49.510 --> 02:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
which goes back to
 
02:37:53.030 --> 02:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
1975 that legislation provides that the
 
02:37:55.790 --> 02:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
only reason you can evict somebody is
 
02:37:58.230 --> 02:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
for something that they had done wrong
 
02:38:00.429 --> 02:38:00.439 align:start position:0%
failure to pay rent violation of park
 
02:38:02.630 --> 02:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
rules Behavior which which threatens the
 
02:38:04.750 --> 02:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
health and safety of others that has
 
02:38:07.590 --> 02:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
been in effect since 1975 and the
 
02:38:10.150 --> 02:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
industry is doing just fine I believe
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
you will see in the record a um a letter
 
02:38:15.950 --> 02:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
from terara Reen who worked for the new
 
02:38:18.590 --> 02:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
Community Loan Fund where they funded
 
02:38:22.510 --> 02:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
the acquisition of I think 140 150
 
02:38:24.630 --> 02:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Parks that's
 
02:38:27.190 --> 02:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
working fine when tenants can only be
 
02:38:29.349 --> 02:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
evicted for something they do
 
02:38:29.359 --> 02:38:31.630 align:start position:0%
evicted for something they do
wrong

02:38:31.630 --> 02:38:31.640 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
02:38:35.870 --> 02:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
so I'd also like to briefly um look at
 
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
the issue about risk taking a chance on
 
02:38:40.870 --> 02:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
risky tenants number one when you've
 
02:38:43.150 --> 02:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
heard about the market conditions and
 
02:38:45.510 --> 02:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
you're comparing two tenants and one has
 
02:38:45.520 --> 02:38:46.349 align:start position:0%
you're comparing two tenants and one has
a

02:38:46.349 --> 02:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:38:48.670 --> 02:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
pretty basic record you a fine record
 
02:38:50.990 --> 02:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
and the other one not so good do you
 
02:38:52.790 --> 02:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
really think in this market that many
 
02:38:54.389 --> 02:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
people are going to take advantage of
 
02:38:57.070 --> 02:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
that and say Yes uh I'll take a chance
 
02:38:58.830 --> 02:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
on you because six months later I can
 
02:39:01.590 --> 02:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
evict you for no reason I doubt it but
 
02:39:03.710 --> 02:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
then there's other the more fundamental
 
02:39:07.590 --> 02:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
question is is it good policy to put
 
02:39:11.710 --> 02:39:11.720 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of tenants at risk of
 
02:39:13.230 --> 02:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
an arbitrary
 
02:39:16.870 --> 02:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
eviction in order to give a a select few
 
02:39:20.590 --> 02:39:20.600 align:start position:0%
a chance at getting theoretical chance
 
02:39:22.309 --> 02:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
of getting chosen when they're Dean
 
02:39:24.950 --> 02:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
brisky I don't think that that's a a
 
02:39:27.950 --> 02:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
fair quid proquo I also want to talk
 
02:39:30.349 --> 02:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
just a little bit about the kinds of
 
02:39:33.150 --> 02:39:33.160 align:start position:0%
people who are at risk you know will a
 
02:39:35.429 --> 02:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
landlord evict somebody for ab
 
02:39:39.670 --> 02:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely no reason no but I'll tell
 
02:39:41.670 --> 02:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
you what are very typical reasons where
 
02:39:44.349 --> 02:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
ca I've had cases myself you have a
 
02:39:46.630 --> 02:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
family with the child and the child
 
02:39:49.670 --> 02:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
cries at night that's what children do
 
02:39:51.870 --> 02:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
that's what children do or they had to
 
02:39:54.269 --> 02:39:54.279 align:start position:0%
take an upstairs unit and sometimes the
 
02:39:57.670 --> 02:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
child jumps around you know that may not
 
02:39:59.590 --> 02:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
be great from the landlord's point of
 
02:40:01.429 --> 02:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
view or even the tenant below but are
 
02:40:03.990 --> 02:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
you going to make that family confront
 
02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
the risk of homelessness because a kid
 
02:40:10.030 --> 02:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
acts like a kid another kind of eviction
 
02:40:12.510 --> 02:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
which I have had time and again where
 
02:40:16.510 --> 02:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
you have either you have seniors or who
 
02:40:18.429 --> 02:40:18.439 align:start position:0%
are don't like me don't have the
 
02:40:22.550 --> 02:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
faculties that they used to have or or
 
02:40:24.870 --> 02:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
you have people with mental illness and
 
02:40:28.150 --> 02:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
they act differently than other people
 
02:40:30.429 --> 02:40:30.439 align:start position:0%
other people are uncomfortable about
 
02:40:35.230 --> 02:40:35.240 align:start position:0%
around them that is a big problem to put
 
02:40:37.150 --> 02:40:37.160 align:start position:0%
somebody like that at risk of
 
02:40:38.950 --> 02:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
homelessness because they're different
 
02:40:41.269 --> 02:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
from other people now somebody here and
 
02:40:43.230 --> 02:40:43.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sure representative Lynn you thought
 
02:40:45.710 --> 02:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
of this are there anti-discrimination
 
02:40:48.269 --> 02:40:48.279 align:start position:0%
statutes both federal and state there
 
02:40:50.750 --> 02:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
sure are and you know what the time
 
02:40:52.630 --> 02:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
frame for HUD Housing and Urban
 
02:40:54.670 --> 02:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
Development to process those those
 
02:40:57.990 --> 02:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
complaints are the law says they're
 
02:41:02.190 --> 02:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to do it in 100 days and in my
 
02:41:04.150 --> 02:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
experience right now they're probably
 
02:41:08.750 --> 02:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
looking at 140 160 days how is that
 
02:41:10.710 --> 02:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
going to help somebody beating eviction
 
02:41:13.510 --> 02:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
down the road when when that's not even
 
02:41:15.990 --> 02:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
going to be litigated there even be a
 
02:41:18.190 --> 02:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
determination of probable cause for
 
02:41:19.950 --> 02:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
months and months and months probably up
 
02:41:24.750 --> 02:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
to half a year um so and this applies
 
02:41:27.870 --> 02:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
again of course you know another kind of
 
02:41:30.309 --> 02:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
situation is where the landlord may be
 
02:41:35.070 --> 02:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
just fine about uh representing uh about
 
02:41:39.710 --> 02:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
uh uh renting to uh um people of
 
02:41:42.469 --> 02:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
color and that's fine but maybe the
 
02:41:44.950 --> 02:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
neighbor isn't so the neighbor makes
 
02:41:47.070 --> 02:41:47.080 align:start position:0%
complaints after complaint after
 
02:41:49.910 --> 02:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
complaint to the landlord about the
 
02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:52.070 align:start position:0%
complaint to the landlord about the
minority

02:41:52.070 --> 02:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
minority
 
02:41:54.590 --> 02:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
tenant you know that can't be grounds
 
02:41:57.190 --> 02:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
for revic of course but but the
 
02:41:59.670 --> 02:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
complaints can't and the point is the
 
02:42:01.670 --> 02:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
landlords this is the kind of thing that
 
02:42:03.230 --> 02:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
does happen I'm not saying that all
 
02:42:06.910 --> 02:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
landlords do this but this is something
 
02:42:09.269 --> 02:42:09.279 align:start position:0%
the chance to evict for no reason with
 
02:42:09.279 --> 02:42:10.190 align:start position:0%
the chance to evict for no reason with
no

02:42:10.190 --> 02:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:42:13.389 --> 02:42:13.399 align:start position:0%
explanation uh makes it very very easy
 
02:42:17.150 --> 02:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
as the jish decision points out out um
 
02:42:18.950 --> 02:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
you know I could go on and on and I know
 
02:42:20.389 --> 02:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
you don't want me to and there's plenty
 
02:42:23.389 --> 02:42:23.399 align:start position:0%
of other people here who could um who
 
02:42:25.590 --> 02:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
have stuff to say I just want one more
 
02:42:27.790 --> 02:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
question I think it was yours uh
 
02:42:29.550 --> 02:42:29.560 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace you asked about
 
02:42:32.950 --> 02:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
people with vacation rentals or um uh
 
02:42:35.630 --> 02:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
recreational rentals there is a specific
 
02:42:41.190 --> 02:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
statute called RSA 5 chapter 5 uh 40- C
 
02:42:43.790 --> 02:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
which allows for evictions without even
 
02:42:46.550 --> 02:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
having to go to court uh for
 
02:42:49.590 --> 02:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
recreational and um and vacation
 
02:42:52.710 --> 02:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
rentals and I'd be happy to take any
 
02:42:55.429 --> 02:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for this
 
02:42:58.349 --> 02:42:58.359 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you thank you
 
02:43:14.269 --> 02:43:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:14.279 --> 02:43:17.230 align:start position:0%
 
please

02:43:17.230 --> 02:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:43:18.870 --> 02:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
hello judicial committee my name is
 
02:43:20.590 --> 02:43:20.600 align:start position:0%
Nicholas Patrick and I'm an independent
 
02:43:22.190 --> 02:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
from Dublin New Hampshire and I'm here
 
02:43:24.670 --> 02:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
to oppose House Bill
 
02:43:28.510 --> 02:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
1115 RSA 542 which is exactly what this
 
02:43:30.710 --> 02:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
is amending was made specifically in
 
02:43:33.590 --> 02:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
1985 for
 
02:43:35.389 --> 02:43:35.399 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination if we were to amend
 
02:43:37.790 --> 02:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
the bill the way they want this would
 
02:43:40.150 --> 02:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely open the door for racial
 
02:43:42.269 --> 02:43:42.279 align:start position:0%
sexual and religious
 
02:43:44.070 --> 02:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination the Supreme Court of New
 
02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire agrees with me in 2005 they
 
02:43:48.349 --> 02:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
made the decision that if we amended it
 
02:43:51.710 --> 02:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
in the way that we did it absolutely
 
02:43:55.870 --> 02:43:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:59.030 --> 02:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
useless and my biggest question is what
 
02:44:00.590 --> 02:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
other reasons would you need to evict
 
02:44:02.870 --> 02:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
someone we already cover safety laws we
 
02:44:04.750 --> 02:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
already cover Health laws we already
 
02:44:06.190 --> 02:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
include just taking the rental
 
02:44:09.429 --> 02:44:09.439 align:start position:0%
completely off the market and raising
 
02:44:11.830 --> 02:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
rent not only that one of the Clauses
 
02:44:14.750 --> 02:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
specifically says any other good cause
 
02:44:16.389 --> 02:44:16.399 align:start position:0%
and my big complaint would be wouldn't
 
02:44:19.469 --> 02:44:19.479 align:start position:0%
selling drugs fall under
 
02:44:21.429 --> 02:44:21.439 align:start position:0%
that and then we already talked a little
 
02:44:23.630 --> 02:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
bit about the vacancy rate so I'll skip
 
02:44:27.110 --> 02:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
that part it's 0.8% for all units and
 
02:44:31.030 --> 02:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
0.6 for two bedrooms which is the most
 
02:44:33.510 --> 02:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
common and not only is this bill this
 
02:44:36.269 --> 02:44:36.279 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill wrong it's also
 
02:44:39.070 --> 02:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
just cruel it's cruel to take children
 
02:44:40.550 --> 02:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
out of a school district they're already
 
02:44:42.870 --> 02:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
simulated into it's cruel to strip
 
02:44:45.269 --> 02:44:45.279 align:start position:0%
parents from their Community they in the
 
02:44:47.150 --> 02:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
relationship and resources that they
 
02:44:49.510 --> 02:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
already have there and it's also cruel
 
02:44:51.710 --> 02:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
to tear apart communities that will
 
02:44:54.870 --> 02:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely increase
 
02:44:57.230 --> 02:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
crime and as a resident of New Hampshire
 
02:44:58.510 --> 02:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
I've already seen the brutality of
 
02:45:00.550 --> 02:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
renting in this state and more
 
02:45:02.870 --> 02:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
importantly I'm a college student at UNH
 
02:45:04.469 --> 02:45:04.479 align:start position:0%
and the town of Durham has already taken
 
02:45:06.830 --> 02:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
a part of discriminating against
 
02:45:11.349 --> 02:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:13.710 --> 02:45:13.720 align:start position:0%
properties and I promise today that if
 
02:45:15.670 --> 02:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
this goes through it will abs absolutely
 
02:45:18.469 --> 02:45:18.479 align:start position:0%
be used against students in the
 
02:45:21.070 --> 02:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
state and will be further used to neuter
 
02:45:24.110 --> 02:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
the education and talent that's needed
 
02:45:26.750 --> 02:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
in the state and I am a proud Granite
 
02:45:29.150 --> 02:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
stator but my state has failed me and my
 
02:45:30.710 --> 02:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
friends who have no choice but to move
 
02:45:32.269 --> 02:45:32.279 align:start position:0%
to other regions as the housing
 
02:45:33.830 --> 02:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
situation here becomes unbearable for
 
02:45:35.670 --> 02:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
the working class thank you and I'm
 
02:45:37.349 --> 02:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you might
 
02:45:40.950 --> 02:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
have any questions representative
 
02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
Smith I'm torn about asking this
 
02:45:48.790 --> 02:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
question but as your representative one
 
02:45:52.190 --> 02:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
of three Durham Representatives who were
 
02:45:56.590 --> 02:45:56.600 align:start position:0%
sitting right here I was somewhat
 
02:46:00.910 --> 02:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
surprised by you saying that the town of
 
02:46:04.750 --> 02:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
Durham has taken steps to discriminate
 
02:46:09.150 --> 02:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
against students do you have facts to
 
02:46:13.349 --> 02:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
support that not not opinion but facts
 
02:46:15.269 --> 02:46:15.279 align:start position:0%
so I mean I can't bring up the specific
 
02:46:16.870 --> 02:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
meeting but specifically it's not I'm
 
02:46:18.590 --> 02:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
not saying that you Representatives have
 
02:46:21.269 --> 02:46:21.279 align:start position:0%
done it but on a a town level we've seen
 
02:46:22.830 --> 02:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
different types of housing be built and
 
02:46:25.150 --> 02:46:25.160 align:start position:0%
we've seen the specific types of housing
 
02:46:27.469 --> 02:46:27.479 align:start position:0%
being built as well as our school
 
02:46:29.150 --> 02:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
administration I don't know if you heard
 
02:46:30.870 --> 02:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
about that had huge budget cuts but also
 
02:46:32.750 --> 02:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
is having a huge housing crisis and
 
02:46:34.950 --> 02:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
students are starting to flood outside
 
02:46:36.550 --> 02:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
near campus housing and it's been
 
02:46:38.550 --> 02:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily hard and we've seen and
 
02:46:39.990 --> 02:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
also if you go to the town meetings and
 
02:46:41.830 --> 02:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
look at not even the administration but
 
02:46:43.190 --> 02:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
the residents themselves there's been a
 
02:46:46.590 --> 02:46:46.600 align:start position:0%
lot of um I'd say discrimination and um
 
02:46:48.030 --> 02:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
oppression towards the students well
 
02:46:49.870 --> 02:46:49.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so clearly it's it's your
 
02:46:52.150 --> 02:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
opinion and of course you're entitled to
 
02:46:55.429 --> 02:46:55.439 align:start position:0%
it but you don't have the facts to
 
02:46:56.990 --> 02:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
demonstrate well if you look at what
 
02:46:58.910 --> 02:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
they're building it that is the facts is
 
02:47:00.110 --> 02:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
what they're building the types of
 
02:47:02.190 --> 02:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
departments they're building are for
 
02:47:05.190 --> 02:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
students I'm violating a very important
 
02:47:07.870 --> 02:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
Rule and that is we do not debate in
 
02:47:11.950 --> 02:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
these hearings um I just felt it um
 
02:47:13.950 --> 02:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
important to understand the great
 
02:47:15.630 --> 02:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
difficulty that the town is going
 
02:47:17.070 --> 02:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
through in terms of trying to meet
 
02:47:19.710 --> 02:47:19.720 align:start position:0%
everyone's housing needs and I imagine
 
02:47:21.309 --> 02:47:21.319 align:start position:0%
that at least the three of us would be
 
02:47:22.630 --> 02:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
happy to talk with you and your
 
02:47:24.429 --> 02:47:24.439 align:start position:0%
colleagues about things that we might do
 
02:47:26.389 --> 02:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
to work together thank you absolutely I
 
02:47:28.230 --> 02:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate your question as well any
 
02:47:30.510 --> 02:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
further questions for this witness sing
 
02:47:34.349 --> 02:47:34.359 align:start position:0%

UNH as well as a longtime resident of
 
02:47:58.349 --> 02:47:58.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire currently splitting my
 
02:48:01.230 --> 02:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
time between Durham and Berlin I'm
 
02:48:04.429 --> 02:48:04.439 align:start position:0%
testifying today in opposition to HP
 
02:48:06.630 --> 02:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
1115 New Hampshire is currently in a
 
02:48:08.309 --> 02:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
housing crisis and this crisis is
 
02:48:10.269 --> 02:48:10.279 align:start position:0%
particularly affecting young people like
 
02:48:13.469 --> 02:48:13.479 align:start position:0%
myself we need ten protections that
 
02:48:15.510 --> 02:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
increase housing stability in State not
 
02:48:17.510 --> 02:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
decrease it which which this bill would
 
02:48:19.710 --> 02:48:19.720 align:start position:0%
do as a young person who calls New
 
02:48:22.269 --> 02:48:22.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire home I have found housing to
 
02:48:23.670 --> 02:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
be one of the biggest barriers to my
 
02:48:26.510 --> 02:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
personal success in the last year I've
 
02:48:29.349 --> 02:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
moved at least seven times I've Liv I've
 
02:48:32.230 --> 02:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
lived on couches in a tent brly in one
 
02:48:34.910 --> 02:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
apartment and dorms in a shack and in my
 
02:48:37.309 --> 02:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
car when it was 11°
 
02:48:39.670 --> 02:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
outside I've worked two to four jobs at
 
02:48:42.110 --> 02:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
all times during this time period it's
 
02:48:43.990 --> 02:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
not because of my lack of working that I
 
02:48:45.710 --> 02:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to afford afford rent
 
02:48:47.510 --> 02:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
is that as a young person in college I
 
02:48:50.030 --> 02:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
simply cannot afford the going rate of
 
02:48:51.429 --> 02:48:51.439 align:start position:0%
housing in the
 
02:48:54.590 --> 02:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
state will I have not personally been
 
02:48:56.349 --> 02:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
evicted I know all too well what it
 
02:48:57.790 --> 02:48:57.800 align:start position:0%
feels like to lose housing in a
 
02:49:00.070 --> 02:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
heartbeat is this what happened to me
 
02:49:02.510 --> 02:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
this past August when I faced unexpected
 
02:49:04.070 --> 02:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
car repairs and suddenly could not
 
02:49:04.080 --> 02:49:04.950 align:start position:0%
car repairs and suddenly could not
afford

02:49:04.950 --> 02:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
afford
 
02:49:07.630 --> 02:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
rent increasing chances of eviction for
 
02:49:10.070 --> 02:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
tenants in New Hampshire is a dangerous
 
02:49:12.590 --> 02:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
decision as more folks would would face
 
02:49:15.150 --> 02:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
situations similar to mine some being
 
02:49:17.790 --> 02:49:17.800 align:start position:0%
forced to live in cars on couches and
 
02:49:20.070 --> 02:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
even on the streets for this reason I
 
02:49:21.990 --> 02:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
urge you to oppose HP
 
02:49:25.190 --> 02:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
11115 thank you for your
 
02:49:27.990 --> 02:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
time thank you for being brief any
 
02:49:29.349 --> 02:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
02:49:43.710 --> 02:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
TBO

02:49:46.070 --> 02:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
TBO
 
02:49:48.110 --> 02:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
02:49:50.150 --> 02:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Keith TBO I live in
 
02:49:52.910 --> 02:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
Swansea New Hampshire um I will be brief
 
02:49:54.030 --> 02:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to make a couple of
 
02:49:56.590 --> 02:49:56.600 align:start position:0%
points um I have been an housing
 
02:49:59.190 --> 02:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
Advocate and served on our local Housing
 
02:50:01.750 --> 02:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
Trust our local Housing Coalition boards
 
02:50:04.990 --> 02:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
and I work for an organization that is a
 
02:50:07.269 --> 02:50:07.279 align:start position:0%
landlord uh to people who are have
 
02:50:07.279 --> 02:50:08.429 align:start position:0%
landlord uh to people who are have
lesser

02:50:08.429 --> 02:50:08.439 align:start position:0%
lesser
 
02:50:11.229 --> 02:50:11.239 align:start position:0%
means if the main reason for this bill
 
02:50:13.309 --> 02:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
is to for a landlord to take a chance on
 
02:50:16.190 --> 02:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
someone that they otherwise wouldn't
 
02:50:16.200 --> 02:50:17.349 align:start position:0%
someone that they otherwise wouldn't
they

02:50:17.349 --> 02:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:50:19.790 --> 02:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
shouldn't they shouldn't take that
 
02:50:21.910 --> 02:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
chance they should allow they they
 
02:50:24.190 --> 02:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
should move on to someone
 
02:50:30.030 --> 02:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
else being a a a good tenant isn't easy
 
02:50:32.030 --> 02:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
but once you've achieved
 
02:50:36.070 --> 02:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
it it's an asset it's a lease is an
 
02:50:39.070 --> 02:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
asset a home is an asset for someone of
 
02:50:42.150 --> 02:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
lesser means they may have no other
 
02:50:45.389 --> 02:50:45.399 align:start position:0%
asset that they can count on
 
02:50:47.269 --> 02:50:47.279 align:start position:0%
think about assets you have that if you
 
02:50:49.150 --> 02:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
had an issue in your life you could
 
02:50:52.150 --> 02:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
count on they don't have that so the two
 
02:50:54.070 --> 02:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
two points I want to make is if if this
 
02:50:56.349 --> 02:50:56.359 align:start position:0%
bill is just there for a landlord to
 
02:50:58.110 --> 02:50:58.120 align:start position:0%
take a chance and then get out of it
 
02:51:00.950 --> 02:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
they're doing no help to that tenant
 
02:51:02.870 --> 02:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
they're enabling them and they should
 
02:51:06.349 --> 02:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
say no we say no to the residents who
 
02:51:08.790 --> 02:51:08.800 align:start position:0%

02:51:11.030 --> 02:51:11.040 align:start position:0%

Hampshire we're a coalition of uh 80
 
02:51:45.150 --> 02:51:45.160 align:start position:0%
organizations we're United around
 
02:51:47.830 --> 02:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
the simple goal of uh improving state
 
02:51:49.269 --> 02:51:49.279 align:start position:0%
and federal policy so everyone in New
 
02:51:51.830 --> 02:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a place to call home many
 
02:51:53.510 --> 02:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
of our members are landlords they
 
02:51:55.309 --> 02:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
develop they build and they manage
 
02:51:56.630 --> 02:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
affordable housing properties and we're
 
02:52:00.510 --> 02:52:00.520 align:start position:0%
here today in opposition to HB 1115
 
02:52:03.150 --> 02:52:03.160 align:start position:0%
since 2009 housing action New Hampshire
 
02:52:04.469 --> 02:52:04.479 align:start position:0%
we've been working in partnership with
 
02:52:06.630 --> 02:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
policy makers from across the Spectrum
 
02:52:08.830 --> 02:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
this ranges from folks who see housing
 
02:52:10.790 --> 02:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
as a widget in the free market and those
 
02:52:15.190 --> 02:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
who believe housing um is is
 
02:52:19.550 --> 02:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
a human right so the one thing that is
 
02:52:21.309 --> 02:52:21.319 align:start position:0%
clear from everybody that we've worked
 
02:52:22.830 --> 02:52:22.840 align:start position:0%
with over the years is that New
 
02:52:25.070 --> 02:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not have enough housing
 
02:52:26.710 --> 02:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh and the shortage has adversely
 
02:52:29.590 --> 02:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
impacted all tenants P particularly low
 
02:52:32.870 --> 02:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
wage um earners as as Mr TBO just
 
02:52:35.990 --> 02:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh so we would argue that at
 
02:52:37.550 --> 02:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
this time especially in the midst of
 
02:52:40.590 --> 02:52:40.600 align:start position:0%
this housing crisis it makes very little
 
02:52:43.070 --> 02:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
sense to tip the scales more and create
 
02:52:44.990 --> 02:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
an even more vulnerable situation for
 
02:52:46.910 --> 02:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
tenants and we would urge the committee
 
02:52:50.910 --> 02:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
uh to find HB 1115 inexpedient to
 
02:52:54.110 --> 02:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
legislate any questions with with this
 
02:52:59.070 --> 02:52:59.080 align:start position:0%
witness saying none thank you you TOR
 
02:53:08.550 --> 02:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:11.710 --> 02:53:11.720 align:start position:0%
on hello my name is tor Bamford and I'm
 
02:53:14.910 --> 02:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
a resident of do uh as we've disced just
 
02:53:18.550 --> 02:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
today good housing is hard to find the
 
02:53:20.389 --> 02:53:20.399 align:start position:0%
price of a single family house is higher
 
02:53:22.510 --> 02:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
than ever mortgage rates are as high as
 
02:53:24.790 --> 02:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
they've been in a long time and the
 
02:53:26.950 --> 02:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
rental market is saturated which drives
 
02:53:29.110 --> 02:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
up the cost of monthly
 
02:53:32.429 --> 02:53:32.439 align:start position:0%
rent the ability to renew a lease is as
 
02:53:34.790 --> 02:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
normal a practice as refinancing a
 
02:53:37.269 --> 02:53:37.279 align:start position:0%
mortgage for a landlord to evict a
 
02:53:39.469 --> 02:53:39.479 align:start position:0%
tenant for no other reason than the
 
02:53:41.630 --> 02:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
ending of a lease it then makes that
 
02:53:44.349 --> 02:53:44.359 align:start position:0%
tenant vulnerable to homelessness which
 
02:53:46.349 --> 02:53:46.359 align:start position:0%
which makes them vulnerable to financial
 
02:53:49.229 --> 02:53:49.239 align:start position:0%
hardship and worse Health worse Health
 
02:53:53.070 --> 02:53:53.080 align:start position:0%
outcomes and more homelessness financial
 
02:53:56.229 --> 02:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
hardship and worse Health outcomes make
 
02:53:57.670 --> 02:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
our communities
 
02:54:00.750 --> 02:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
vulnerable for myself personally if I
 
02:54:03.429 --> 02:54:03.439 align:start position:0%
found myself in this situation I know
 
02:54:05.150 --> 02:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
that I have the privilege of being able
 
02:54:08.469 --> 02:54:08.479 align:start position:0%
to live with family I would be okay
 
02:54:10.110 --> 02:54:10.120 align:start position:0%
others may not have that privilege for a
 
02:54:12.590 --> 02:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
number of reasons you've heard testimony
 
02:54:14.830 --> 02:54:14.840 align:start position:0%
from some of some people with these
 
02:54:16.269 --> 02:54:16.279 align:start position:0%
stories this
 
02:54:18.950 --> 02:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
morning landlords should only be able to
 
02:54:21.229 --> 02:54:21.239 align:start position:0%
evict tenants for a good cause thus
 
02:54:23.590 --> 02:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
backed up with repeated evidence there
 
02:54:26.309 --> 02:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
is a legal pathway for eviction and this
 
02:54:29.229 --> 02:54:29.239 align:start position:0%
bill is not the right pathway stand up
 
02:54:31.070 --> 02:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
for people who don't have the privilege
 
02:54:33.870 --> 02:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
that I have stand up for the well-being
 
02:54:37.469 --> 02:54:37.479 align:start position:0%
of our communities please oppose this
 
02:54:40.229 --> 02:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
bill any questions for this
 
02:54:42.870 --> 02:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you the
 
02:54:57.870 --> 02:54:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:02.150 --> 02:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:05.710 --> 02:55:05.720 align:start position:0%
please can you hear me now thank you hi
 
02:55:07.670 --> 02:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
my name is Jessica Marson I'm aant
 
02:55:09.750 --> 02:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
organizer with Granite State organizing
 
02:55:12.710 --> 02:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
project but I am here today representing
 
02:55:14.870 --> 02:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
myself um I wanted to start with a
 
02:55:17.630 --> 02:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
couple things
 
02:55:20.070 --> 02:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
um one thing to make sure everybody
 
02:55:22.710 --> 02:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
knows ahead of time before I forget is
 
02:55:25.550 --> 02:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
um court paperwork commonly when I have
 
02:55:28.030 --> 02:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
a tenant that has a renovation eviction
 
02:55:29.910 --> 02:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
um that comes into my tenant Clinic to
 
02:55:32.389 --> 02:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
help um I have to just tell them you
 
02:55:34.110 --> 02:55:34.120 align:start position:0%
know a renovation eviction is different
 
02:55:36.469 --> 02:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
than a non-payment this can sometimes be
 
02:55:37.910 --> 02:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
helpful when you're looking for a new
 
02:55:40.030 --> 02:55:40.040 align:start position:0%
place make sure you show your next
 
02:55:41.910 --> 02:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
landlord that this is why you're being
 
02:55:44.349 --> 02:55:44.359 align:start position:0%
evicted what a lot of people don't know
 
02:55:46.590 --> 02:55:46.600 align:start position:0%
is that after 3 years that paperwork at
 
02:55:48.750 --> 02:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
the court is thrown away and what they
 
02:55:50.990 --> 02:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
can go back to get is called a case
 
02:55:53.510 --> 02:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
summary it doesn't list what type of
 
02:55:56.229 --> 02:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
eviction all the nuances and motions in
 
02:55:58.309 --> 02:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
there it just lists everything like um a
 
02:56:01.429 --> 02:56:01.439 align:start position:0%
table of contents basically so tenants
 
02:56:02.830 --> 02:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
are advised to hold on to their
 
02:56:05.389 --> 02:56:05.399 align:start position:0%
paperwork so in the future 10 years from
 
02:56:08.070 --> 02:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
now they go to apply they can explain
 
02:56:11.389 --> 02:56:11.399 align:start position:0%
that eviction um so with our ra U the
 
02:56:14.309 --> 02:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
mass renovation evictions we've had over
 
02:56:15.910 --> 02:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
the past few years it's been very
 
02:56:18.349 --> 02:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
detrimental in tenants trying to find
 
02:56:20.510 --> 02:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
housing when it relates to
 
02:56:22.429 --> 02:56:22.439 align:start position:0%
discrimination that's something I can
 
02:56:26.190 --> 02:56:26.200 align:start position:0%
speak on huge I see it left and right in
 
02:56:28.550 --> 02:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
the tenant Clinic I'm currently helping
 
02:56:30.389 --> 02:56:30.399 align:start position:0%
two different tenants with
 
02:56:32.750 --> 02:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
discrimination issues but I'll tell you
 
02:56:35.469 --> 02:56:35.479 align:start position:0%
that that eviction paperwork moves a lot
 
02:56:37.590 --> 02:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
quicker than a grievance or a HUD
 
02:56:39.630 --> 02:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
complaint does to try and help them
 
02:56:41.830 --> 02:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
through the Discrimination so they can
 
02:56:44.670 --> 02:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
in fact become um
 
02:56:46.469 --> 02:56:46.479 align:start position:0%
could almost become evicted before they
 
02:56:48.429 --> 02:56:48.439 align:start position:0%
deal with that discrimination this would
 
02:56:50.190 --> 02:56:50.200 align:start position:0%
make this bill would make it quicker for
 
02:56:52.710 --> 02:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
that to happen currently tenants right
 
02:56:55.150 --> 02:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
now are terrified to complain about
 
02:56:57.550 --> 02:56:57.560 align:start position:0%
valid safety issues in their units
 
02:56:58.550 --> 02:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
because they're scared of that
 
02:57:01.550 --> 02:57:01.560 align:start position:0%
renovation eviction this will be the
 
02:57:03.910 --> 02:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
second thing they're scared of it
 
02:57:07.030 --> 02:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
commonly takes families at 30% to 60%
 
02:57:09.510 --> 02:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
area median income 6 months to one year
 
02:57:12.550 --> 02:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
to recover from a move I know that I've
 
02:57:14.510 --> 02:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
had to go through multiple moves lately
 
02:57:17.309 --> 02:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
with uh my kids leaving the house and
 
02:57:20.070 --> 02:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's been detrimental to me um there's
 
02:57:22.229 --> 02:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
not enough places out there I've had to
 
02:57:24.870 --> 02:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
create programs that help a tenant show
 
02:57:27.750 --> 02:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
that they are good tenants out there um
 
02:57:29.790 --> 02:57:29.800 align:start position:0%
but this bill does not help any
 
02:57:31.750 --> 02:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
minorities it does not help those single
 
02:57:33.910 --> 02:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
mothers who are routinely and there's
 
02:57:36.070 --> 02:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
facts there's a study on that that you
 
02:57:39.510 --> 02:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
can find where single mothers are more
 
02:57:42.990 --> 02:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
routinely evicted than fathers we're
 
02:57:45.190 --> 02:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
seeing as simple t targets easy targets
 
02:57:47.469 --> 02:57:47.479 align:start position:0%
we're terrified to lose our home for our
 
02:57:49.950 --> 02:57:49.960 align:start position:0%
kids we'll do what it takes to keep it
 
02:57:52.469 --> 02:57:52.479 align:start position:0%
um so I urge you that this is not the
 
02:57:54.750 --> 02:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
time for this bill maybe when we have a
 
02:57:57.190 --> 02:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
more robust Market but we have a good
 
02:57:59.590 --> 02:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
thing right now which do cause where
 
02:58:01.950 --> 02:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
other states are trying to be like us
 
02:58:03.389 --> 02:58:03.399 align:start position:0%
why do we want to get rid of a good
 
02:58:07.030 --> 02:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
thing thank you thank you any questions
 
02:58:08.349 --> 02:58:08.359 align:start position:0%
for this
 
02:58:11.229 --> 02:58:11.239 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none uh is there anyone
 
02:58:12.910 --> 02:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
else that wishes to speak on House Bill
 
02:58:12.920 --> 02:58:15.590 align:start position:0%
else that wishes to speak on House Bill
1115

02:58:15.590 --> 02:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
1115
 
02:58:17.190 --> 02:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
saying none we'll close the hearing um
 
02:58:19.469 --> 02:58:19.479 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman oh can I just ask a question
 
02:58:20.870 --> 02:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh it's very brief it might be for the
 
02:58:23.349 --> 02:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
clerk do we have the current numbers um
 
02:58:25.750 --> 02:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
for those who signed in support of this
 
02:58:42.910 --> 02:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:42.920 --> 02:58:52.190 align:start position:0%
 
opposed

02:58:52.190 --> 02:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:56.229 --> 02:58:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:59.349 --> 02:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
kab standing
 
02:59:03.309 --> 02:59:03.319 align:start position:0%
by online we have 10 in support 147
 
02:59:07.910 --> 02:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:11.349 --> 02:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
sheet 12 opposed here 12
 
02:59:20.670 --> 02:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:23.910 --> 02:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so um representative
 
02:59:26.830 --> 02:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
Gallagher yeah I'm going to uh open the
 
02:59:29.750 --> 02:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
hearing now on uh House Bill
 
02:59:32.429 --> 02:59:32.439 align:start position:0%
1368 and I know we're running late I
 
02:59:36.990 --> 02:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:40.510 --> 02:59:40.520 align:start position:0%
that and I'm going to call uh
 
02:59:50.510 --> 02:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:50.520 --> 03:00:12.750 align:start position:0%
 
there's

03:00:12.750 --> 03:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:12.760 --> 03:00:35.670 align:start position:0%
 
area

03:00:35.670 --> 03:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:40.190 --> 03:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
all right so hi I'm representative Eric
 
03:00:43.790 --> 03:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
Gallagher uh representing marrat County
 
03:00:47.550 --> 03:00:47.560 align:start position:0%
District 20 which is conquered W
 
03:00:53.830 --> 03:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
6 um and I am here to introduce House
 
03:00:53.840 --> 03:00:55.150 align:start position:0%
6 um and I am here to introduce House
Bill

03:00:55.150 --> 03:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:00:58.030 --> 03:00:58.040 align:start position:0%
1368 prohibiting termination of a tency
 
03:01:00.269 --> 03:01:00.279 align:start position:0%
based on a tenant failure to pay rent
 
03:01:02.110 --> 03:01:02.120 align:start position:0%
that was increased by Sur and price
 
03:01:05.229 --> 03:01:05.239 align:start position:0%
fixing programs so um I'll just start
 
03:01:07.429 --> 03:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
off by saying that wasn't my original
 
03:01:11.790 --> 03:01:11.800 align:start position:0%
title for this bill um my
 
03:01:15.670 --> 03:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
original title for this bill would have
 
03:01:19.070 --> 03:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
been um relative to the right to inspect
 
03:01:22.070 --> 03:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
source code of rent setting software for
 
03:01:26.469 --> 03:01:26.479 align:start position:0%
tenants um so you may remember
 
03:01:30.389 --> 03:01:30.399 align:start position:0%
from um the previous year of this term
 
03:01:34.070 --> 03:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh I had a bill before this committee um
 
03:01:38.389 --> 03:01:38.399 align:start position:0%
providing for a right to um inspect the
 
03:01:40.790 --> 03:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
source code of
 
03:01:44.950 --> 03:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
um software used to generate evidence in
 
03:01:48.429 --> 03:01:48.439 align:start position:0%
criminal proceedings so um one of the
 
03:01:50.630 --> 03:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
major criticisms of that and the reason
 
03:01:56.510 --> 03:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
it died was uh well um it will hold
 
03:01:59.870 --> 03:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
up um it will hold up hearings too much
 
03:01:59.880 --> 03:02:01.990 align:start position:0%
up um it will hold up hearings too much
and

03:02:01.990 --> 03:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:02:05.030 --> 03:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I could I could see that um
 
03:02:07.990 --> 03:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
some criminal hearings do actually need
 
03:02:12.070 --> 03:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
speed for them so um I was thinking all
 
03:02:15.070 --> 03:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
right um what other sort of court
 
03:02:21.710 --> 03:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
hearing could I introduce a um right to
 
03:02:25.670 --> 03:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
inspect source code into so um while
 
03:02:28.710 --> 03:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
thinking about that I come across this
 
03:02:33.349 --> 03:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
um propublica article um
 
03:02:33.359 --> 03:02:34.950 align:start position:0%
um propublica article um
about

03:02:34.950 --> 03:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:02:34.960 --> 03:02:36.950 align:start position:0%
about
um

03:02:36.950 --> 03:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:42.550 --> 03:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
this company's algorithm um there's this
 
03:02:42.560 --> 03:02:45.110 align:start position:0%
this company's algorithm um there's this
um

03:02:45.110 --> 03:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:48.590 --> 03:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
company called or software called yield
 
03:02:54.229 --> 03:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
star that um landlords are
 
03:02:54.239 --> 03:02:55.830 align:start position:0%
star that um landlords are
using

03:02:55.830 --> 03:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
using
 
03:03:03.070 --> 03:03:03.080 align:start position:0%
um for rent setting purposes um and so
 
03:03:06.309 --> 03:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
when I learned about that I thought oh
 
03:03:08.309 --> 03:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
okay this is actually a perfect
 
03:03:11.510 --> 03:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to con combine two of my
 
03:03:15.590 --> 03:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
separate um issue area is um of interest
 
03:03:19.110 --> 03:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
um both the um open- Source software on
 
03:03:20.950 --> 03:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
the one hand and then housing on the
 
03:03:24.309 --> 03:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
other so um I thought all right let's
 
03:03:25.750 --> 03:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
move this right
 
03:03:27.830 --> 03:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
into eviction
 
03:03:31.269 --> 03:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
proceedings um so the thing
 
03:03:35.590 --> 03:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
about um so the thing about yield star
 
03:03:38.429 --> 03:03:38.439 align:start position:0%
is it's basically this proprietary
 
03:03:41.229 --> 03:03:41.239 align:start position:0%
program which none of the rest of us
 
03:03:43.630 --> 03:03:43.640 align:start position:0%
really know how it works for all we know
 
03:03:45.710 --> 03:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
could be there could be some network
 
03:03:47.670 --> 03:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
communications going on communicating
 
03:03:50.309 --> 03:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
with other landlords to lead to some
 
03:03:55.750 --> 03:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
sort of um price fixing setup
 
03:04:00.990 --> 03:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
um where there's um illegal Market
 
03:04:03.389 --> 03:04:03.399 align:start position:0%
coordination and if that sort of thing
 
03:04:05.349 --> 03:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
is going on we should be able to have a
 
03:04:08.550 --> 03:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
way to find out about it and I think the
 
03:04:12.750 --> 03:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
best way to go about that would be to be
 
03:04:15.150 --> 03:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
able to find it out during the eviction
 
03:04:19.110 --> 03:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
proceedings for um a tenant so basically
 
03:04:23.630 --> 03:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
the idea is that um tenant facing
 
03:04:23.640 --> 03:04:25.269 align:start position:0%
the idea is that um tenant facing
eviction

03:04:25.269 --> 03:04:25.279 align:start position:0%
eviction
 
03:04:29.070 --> 03:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
um if they thought that their landlord
 
03:04:33.710 --> 03:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
was using the software um would exercise
 
03:04:36.870 --> 03:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
their right to inspect then then upon
 
03:04:38.870 --> 03:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
inspection if it's found out that yes
 
03:04:41.389 --> 03:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
they were indeed engaging in price
 
03:04:46.150 --> 03:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
fixing then the ition would be invalid
 
03:04:49.710 --> 03:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I see this
 
03:04:55.550 --> 03:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
um as a tenant protection bill
 
03:04:59.349 --> 03:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
um so um yeah part part of the thing
 
03:05:01.309 --> 03:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
about free markets is they're supposed
 
03:05:06.150 --> 03:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
to work when everyone um sets prices
 
03:05:08.710 --> 03:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
independently rather than
 
03:05:12.950 --> 03:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
colluding on them um because if they are
 
03:05:12.960 --> 03:05:13.790 align:start position:0%
colluding on them um because if they are
um

03:05:13.790 --> 03:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:19.309 --> 03:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
if you do have collusion then um it
 
03:05:22.750 --> 03:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
can it can lead to prices much higher
 
03:05:25.510 --> 03:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
than what the uh Market will otherwise
 
03:05:29.630 --> 03:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
determine so um I think that
 
03:05:34.349 --> 03:05:34.359 align:start position:0%
um yeah having a right to inspect source
 
03:05:35.990 --> 03:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
code would be a good way of fighting
 
03:05:38.469 --> 03:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
this I'll also note that
 
03:05:41.229 --> 03:05:41.239 align:start position:0%
um I since having filed this bill I've
 
03:05:44.070 --> 03:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
learned that there is also um Federal
 
03:05:46.670 --> 03:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
legislation pending on this topic um
 
03:05:50.830 --> 03:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
Senator Ron weiden is one of the chief
 
03:05:54.309 --> 03:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
sponsors um although
 
03:05:58.469 --> 03:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll note that um they filed that
 
03:06:02.110 --> 03:06:02.120 align:start position:0%
after I'd already filed mine so um I I
 
03:06:04.030 --> 03:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
don't haven't really had a chance to
 
03:06:06.910 --> 03:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
look at to see if it handles things in
 
03:06:09.550 --> 03:06:09.560 align:start position:0%
the same way or a different way um but
 
03:06:13.630 --> 03:06:13.640 align:start position:0%
it is something that other people have
 
03:06:16.389 --> 03:06:16.399 align:start position:0%
an interest in addressing legislatively
 
03:06:23.030 --> 03:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
too um so yeah that's uh HB
 
03:06:26.670 --> 03:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
1368 and I'll uh take questions on it
 
03:06:29.590 --> 03:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
now all right questions for this
 
03:06:32.150 --> 03:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
witness don't see any so oh yes I'm
 
03:06:33.309 --> 03:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
sorry representative
 
03:06:35.870 --> 03:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
man thank you Mr chair thank you
 
03:06:37.750 --> 03:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher for taking my
 
03:06:40.190 --> 03:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
question I believe you characterized
 
03:06:43.990 --> 03:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
yield Star as being proprietary so I'm
 
03:06:46.870 --> 03:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
wondering how there would even be open-
 
03:06:50.630 --> 03:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
source code to have access
 
03:06:50.640 --> 03:06:52.750 align:start position:0%
source code to have access
to

03:06:52.750 --> 03:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:06:56.150 --> 03:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
well the idea would be to require to
 
03:06:58.910 --> 03:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
make them to um have them make it open
 
03:07:01.750 --> 03:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
source and also sometimes proprietary
 
03:07:06.790 --> 03:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
companies will be violating um will be
 
03:07:09.710 --> 03:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
violating the licenses of open- source
 
03:07:13.229 --> 03:07:13.239 align:start position:0%
code that they make use of um so there's
 
03:07:16.349 --> 03:07:16.359 align:start position:0%
certain um there's certain open source
 
03:07:18.830 --> 03:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
licenses known as copy left where it
 
03:07:25.110 --> 03:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:28.030 --> 03:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
um that if you're going to use this code
 
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
you have to keep it open source and um
 
03:07:34.910 --> 03:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
basically the way you find out about
 
03:07:41.349 --> 03:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
that is by lawsuits um if if some if if
 
03:07:46.229 --> 03:07:46.239 align:start position:0%
it is using open source code um without
 
03:07:50.150 --> 03:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
someone filing a lawsuit about it then
 
03:07:52.790 --> 03:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
that sort of um license violation can
 
03:07:58.030 --> 03:07:58.040 align:start position:0%
just go by undetected so um I think um
 
03:07:59.590 --> 03:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
giving another
 
03:07:59.600 --> 03:08:01.670 align:start position:0%
giving another
chance

03:08:01.670 --> 03:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
chance
 
03:08:05.950 --> 03:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
um giving um eviction hearings as
 
03:08:08.830 --> 03:08:08.840 align:start position:0%
another venue for determining if that's
 
03:08:13.190 --> 03:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
happen happening or not uh would be uh
 
03:08:16.110 --> 03:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
um helpful for determining if that sort
 
03:08:18.870 --> 03:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
of thing is happening other questions
 
03:08:21.110 --> 03:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative D Lorenzo hi thank
 
03:08:22.870 --> 03:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:08:25.030 --> 03:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
question I am really confused I read
 
03:08:30.150 --> 03:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
this bill and it didn't sink in um so
 
03:08:32.110 --> 03:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about uh yield star
 
03:08:36.550 --> 03:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
software what do they do so basically
 
03:08:43.950 --> 03:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
um so basically landlords will um
 
03:08:47.389 --> 03:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
use this software to um for advice about
 
03:08:49.429 --> 03:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
what they cons sent the r to they'll say
 
03:08:51.710 --> 03:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
like um okay this is what my current
 
03:08:53.670 --> 03:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
rant is and then the software will say
 
03:08:56.630 --> 03:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
oh well actually how about you try
 
03:08:59.590 --> 03:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
setting it to this value instead so then
 
03:09:03.269 --> 03:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
they go and do that and then they can
 
03:09:07.229 --> 03:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
um they whe When the tenants ask hey why
 
03:09:09.870 --> 03:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
you guys they can they have it basically
 
03:09:12.990 --> 03:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
gives them something to offload
 
03:09:15.710 --> 03:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility onto oh the algorithm
 
03:09:17.429 --> 03:09:17.439 align:start position:0%
made me do it therefore you can't blame
 
03:09:22.389 --> 03:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
me for raising your rent um so yeah if
 
03:09:24.389 --> 03:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
you're going to be handing off the
 
03:09:27.030 --> 03:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility for how you make your
 
03:09:30.349 --> 03:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
rent pricing decisions to an algorithm
 
03:09:33.110 --> 03:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
we should at least be able to see how
 
03:09:34.990 --> 03:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
that algorithm
 
03:09:39.710 --> 03:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
works I follow yes please so um with
 
03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
that are you saying
 
03:09:41.920 --> 03:09:43.590 align:start position:0%
that are you saying
that

03:09:43.590 --> 03:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:09:48.190 --> 03:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
tenants deserve to know what factors are
 
03:09:51.790 --> 03:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
driving their rent yes that's that's um
 
03:09:55.429 --> 03:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
exactly it thank you other questions for
 
03:09:58.070 --> 03:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
this wit representative tur uh yeah
 
03:09:59.950 --> 03:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
thanks and and thanks for taking the
 
03:10:02.710 --> 03:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
question um when you were talking about
 
03:10:05.630 --> 03:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
yield star it it seemed unclear whether
 
03:10:09.870 --> 03:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
or not we know that this software
 
03:10:12.349 --> 03:10:12.359 align:start position:0%
actually does the type of sort of
 
03:10:14.550 --> 03:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
background collusion I guess is what I'd
 
03:10:18.150 --> 03:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
call it um that that's being referred is
 
03:10:19.990 --> 03:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
that is that true do we know whether
 
03:10:24.389 --> 03:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
this is actually happening um in in the
 
03:10:26.710 --> 03:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
software or in any other or any other
 
03:10:28.349 --> 03:10:28.359 align:start position:0%
software right now and and I guess would
 
03:10:33.229 --> 03:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
that be covered by you know uh any law
 
03:10:37.229 --> 03:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
prohibiting that kind of collusion um so
 
03:10:39.150 --> 03:10:39.160 align:start position:0%
what we do know is that landlords are
 
03:10:42.670 --> 03:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
using the software what we don't know is
 
03:10:42.680 --> 03:10:43.870 align:start position:0%
using the software what we don't know is
uh

03:10:43.870 --> 03:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:10:48.030 --> 03:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
if it's uh enabling the sort of
 
03:10:52.830 --> 03:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
collusion that I'm concerned about um so
 
03:10:55.190 --> 03:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
and yeah the reason that or the fact
 
03:10:56.950 --> 03:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
that we don't know is precisely my
 
03:10:59.550 --> 03:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
reason for introducing this so that we
 
03:11:05.670 --> 03:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
can know um you know um I I think you
 
03:11:08.870 --> 03:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
know it if if you star truly
 
03:11:11.630 --> 03:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
isn't doing
 
03:11:14.229 --> 03:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
anything uh anything wrong then they
 
03:11:16.309 --> 03:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
should be able to show us and show the
 
03:11:19.630 --> 03:11:19.640 align:start position:0%
tenants whose rent it's increasing that
 
03:11:21.389 --> 03:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
it's not doing anything
 
03:11:24.309 --> 03:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
wrong can I ask one quick qu of course
 
03:11:27.950 --> 03:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
do we um I guess I'm wondering the idea
 
03:11:29.910 --> 03:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
of attaching this to the idea of an
 
03:11:33.030 --> 03:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
eviction um seems a little tangential to
 
03:11:35.030 --> 03:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
I guess the underlying question you're
 
03:11:36.830 --> 03:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
really sort of trying to get at whether
 
03:11:40.030 --> 03:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
or not um rent prices in general are
 
03:11:42.349 --> 03:11:42.359 align:start position:0%
being fixed by this right as opposed to
 
03:11:44.349 --> 03:11:44.359 align:start position:0%
I'm C curious about why the attaching of
 
03:11:45.910 --> 03:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
this to the idea of an
 
03:11:48.229 --> 03:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
eviction um well
 
03:11:48.239 --> 03:11:50.070 align:start position:0%
eviction um well
because

03:11:50.070 --> 03:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:11:53.269 --> 03:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
um well because that's what the effect
 
03:11:56.510 --> 03:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
that high rents has is in creating
 
03:12:01.590 --> 03:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
evictions um you you know the um the
 
03:12:01.600 --> 03:12:02.950 align:start position:0%
evictions um you you know the um the
eviction

03:12:02.950 --> 03:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
eviction
 
03:12:06.870 --> 03:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
follows precisely or yeah one one of the
 
03:12:08.790 --> 03:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
reasons that evictions can happen is due
 
03:12:10.870 --> 03:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
to non-payment of the rent and if the
 
03:12:13.229 --> 03:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
rent was too high because
 
03:12:14.670 --> 03:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
um it
 
03:12:18.830 --> 03:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
was priced in an improper faction then
 
03:12:21.469 --> 03:12:21.479 align:start position:0%
um that that shouldn't be something that
 
03:12:23.469 --> 03:12:23.479 align:start position:0%
tenant should have to
 
03:12:26.990 --> 03:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
pay Mr chair representative Lorenzo
 
03:12:30.349 --> 03:12:30.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so um
 
03:12:34.590 --> 03:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
when I was working in housing um I would
 
03:12:38.229 --> 03:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
set the rent using a market study I
 
03:12:41.349 --> 03:12:41.359 align:start position:0%
would go to three comparable properties
 
03:12:43.910 --> 03:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
and find out you know you know what that
 
03:12:45.990 --> 03:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
what those owners are charging for rent
 
03:12:49.670 --> 03:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
and then make you know come up with some
 
03:12:52.110 --> 03:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
numbers for my own property would that
 
03:12:53.950 --> 03:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
be considered price
 
03:12:53.960 --> 03:12:55.790 align:start position:0%
be considered price
fixing

03:12:55.790 --> 03:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
fixing
 
03:12:57.389 --> 03:12:57.399 align:start position:0%
um I
 
03:13:00.269 --> 03:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
mean I I think it would only be
 
03:13:02.910 --> 03:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
considered price fixing if you were
 
03:13:07.870 --> 03:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
using a specific piece of software to um
 
03:13:10.670 --> 03:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
enter into an agreement with the owners
 
03:13:12.750 --> 03:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
of those other pieces of property that
 
03:13:15.269 --> 03:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
you're comparing against um if you're
 
03:13:16.750 --> 03:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
just looking at them
 
03:13:20.590 --> 03:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
independently and um not not talking
 
03:13:22.510 --> 03:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
with the other owners at all then yeah
 
03:13:24.190 --> 03:13:24.200 align:start position:0%
that's fine that's just the market at
 
03:13:27.990 --> 03:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
work but um the it's the um
 
03:13:31.030 --> 03:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
communication Factor um the Collision
 
03:13:36.349 --> 03:13:36.359 align:start position:0%
factor that is um whe When landlords get
 
03:13:39.190 --> 03:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
together um to make their pricing
 
03:13:42.670 --> 03:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
decisions that is what I'm worried about
 
03:13:44.190 --> 03:13:44.200 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
03:13:48.190 --> 03:13:48.200 align:start position:0%
witness representative orgon how does uh
 
03:13:49.790 --> 03:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
how do they collect the data to feed
 
03:13:53.429 --> 03:13:53.439 align:start position:0%
into the algorithm I is there some sort
 
03:13:56.550 --> 03:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
of a is there some sort of standard uh
 
03:13:59.510 --> 03:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
source for for for rals I mean it's not
 
03:14:00.910 --> 03:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
like it's not like if you're trying to
 
03:14:02.950 --> 03:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
figure out what to sell a property for
 
03:14:05.469 --> 03:14:05.479 align:start position:0%
where all the uh where all the sales
 
03:14:07.229 --> 03:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
have to be recorded with the Registries
 
03:14:09.710 --> 03:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
of Deeds so there a public access uh
 
03:14:11.750 --> 03:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
data source for it so how do they how do
 
03:14:13.550 --> 03:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
they find the numb to feed into their
 
03:14:13.560 --> 03:14:15.990 align:start position:0%
they find the numb to feed into their
algorithm

03:14:15.990 --> 03:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
algorithm
 
03:14:19.710 --> 03:14:19.720 align:start position:0%
um so it um I I guess I should probably
 
03:14:22.030 --> 03:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
send around the article in question to
 
03:14:25.309 --> 03:14:25.319 align:start position:0%
the um to the committee uh I'll email
 
03:14:29.110 --> 03:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
that afterwards but um yeah it says that
 
03:14:31.830 --> 03:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
um software uses aggregated Market data
 
03:14:34.590 --> 03:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
from a variety of sources in a legally
 
03:14:36.910 --> 03:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
compliant manner but that's the company
 
03:14:40.550 --> 03:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative saying that so um it's
 
03:14:42.750 --> 03:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
basically just you have to take their
 
03:14:46.389 --> 03:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
word for it that that's how it works um
 
03:14:50.349 --> 03:14:50.359 align:start position:0%
and I think further investigation if
 
03:14:52.030 --> 03:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
into whether they're telling the truth
 
03:14:54.510 --> 03:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
or not would be
 
03:14:57.429 --> 03:14:57.439 align:start position:0%
useful other questions for this
 
03:14:59.590 --> 03:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
witness representative
 
03:15:02.110 --> 03:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
me thank you thank you for taking my
 
03:15:05.269 --> 03:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
question um so I guess one question I
 
03:15:05.279 --> 03:15:06.670 align:start position:0%
question um so I guess one question I
have

03:15:06.670 --> 03:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:15:09.790 --> 03:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
is if the source code is is allowed to
 
03:15:13.309 --> 03:15:13.319 align:start position:0%
be admitted to to evidence it becomes
 
03:15:15.510 --> 03:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
public record do is that the intent for
 
03:15:19.269 --> 03:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
it to be freely available to everyone
 
03:15:24.429 --> 03:15:24.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:27.870 --> 03:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
intent um followup yeah I guess not
 
03:15:29.990 --> 03:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
exactly followup just a like a secondary
 
03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:32.269 align:start position:0%
exactly followup just a like a secondary
question

03:15:32.269 --> 03:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:15:35.429 --> 03:15:35.439 align:start position:0%
um so what part of the source code do do
 
03:15:40.229 --> 03:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:42.510 --> 03:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
um what would you what do you anticipate
 
03:15:44.429 --> 03:15:44.439 align:start position:0%
finding in the source code some sort of
 
03:15:48.110 --> 03:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
connection between landlords yeah some
 
03:15:51.030 --> 03:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
sort of oh yeah go yeah some sort of
 
03:15:57.110 --> 03:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
network connection um using um like if
 
03:15:59.349 --> 03:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
what what I'm imagining would happen is
 
03:16:02.189 --> 03:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
there it probably has some sort of um
 
03:16:05.950 --> 03:16:05.960 align:start position:0%
Telemetry in it where um you know it
 
03:16:07.469 --> 03:16:07.479 align:start position:0%
suggests a price to the
 
03:16:11.070 --> 03:16:11.080 align:start position:0%
landlord um they either choose to accept
 
03:16:16.309 --> 03:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
it or not um and then it um basically um
 
03:16:19.790 --> 03:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
if it phones home or yeah phones home
 
03:16:24.910 --> 03:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
with that um data and then um the all of
 
03:16:26.910 --> 03:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
the data that's been phoned home to
 
03:16:30.269 --> 03:16:30.279 align:start position:0%
their servers then gets put into a
 
03:16:34.990 --> 03:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
larger model that um takes all of that
 
03:16:38.950 --> 03:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
into account um
 
03:16:41.750 --> 03:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
that yeah that that would be the sort of
 
03:16:45.189 --> 03:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
behavior that um I'd be concerned
 
03:16:48.910 --> 03:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
about um followup yes so it it would be
 
03:16:51.030 --> 03:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
some kind of excuse me it'd be some kind
 
03:16:54.309 --> 03:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
of geographical data Maybe um some way
 
03:16:56.790 --> 03:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
of identifi identifying the location of
 
03:16:59.510 --> 03:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
these requests through IP address or
 
03:17:01.790 --> 03:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
something like that um zip code I guess
 
03:17:03.950 --> 03:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
um that like I I mean i' assume the
 
03:17:08.790 --> 03:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
addresses of the actual units um being
 
03:17:13.870 --> 03:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
granted would be part of it um
 
03:17:16.189 --> 03:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
okay but yeah something like that other
 
03:17:17.830 --> 03:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
03:17:21.550 --> 03:17:21.560 align:start position:0%
wit so I guess I just have one it if I'm
 
03:17:25.309 --> 03:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
understanding correctly it sounds like
 
03:17:28.710 --> 03:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
you're you're concerned about sort of
 
03:17:31.710 --> 03:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
antitrust violations by landlords and
 
03:17:36.510 --> 03:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
and that you would make engaging in an
 
03:17:38.469 --> 03:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
antitrust violation of the kind you
 
03:17:41.030 --> 03:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
describe in the bill a defense to an
 
03:17:43.830 --> 03:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
eviction yeah yes that's correct
 
03:17:46.790 --> 03:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
evictions are generally summary
 
03:17:49.349 --> 03:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
proceedings um I'm just wondering have
 
03:17:51.790 --> 03:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
you thought about what the what the
 
03:17:55.590 --> 03:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:57.990 --> 03:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
allowing essentially a tenant to raise
 
03:18:01.229 --> 03:18:01.239 align:start position:0%
an antitrust violation as a defense to a
 
03:18:04.309 --> 03:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
summary proceeding would the effect that
 
03:18:08.030 --> 03:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
would likely have on landlords and on
 
03:18:11.189 --> 03:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
what rentals would likely be if that
 
03:18:12.710 --> 03:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
were something that
 
03:18:14.990 --> 03:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
landlords had to worry about as a
 
03:18:18.670 --> 03:18:18.680 align:start position:0%
defense cases I mean I'm not a lawyer um
 
03:18:22.550 --> 03:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
so uh yeah if you could Define a summary
 
03:18:24.870 --> 03:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
proceeding for me um which means it's
 
03:18:26.550 --> 03:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to happen quickly supposed to
 
03:18:29.070 --> 03:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
be if the proceeding supposed to be
 
03:18:34.030 --> 03:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
started and finished pretty quickly um
 
03:18:38.389 --> 03:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
well yeah um I guess the
 
03:18:41.269 --> 03:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
um or and does it say in law
 
03:18:43.070 --> 03:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
specifically that they have to be
 
03:18:45.189 --> 03:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
summary proceedings um because I I
 
03:18:48.309 --> 03:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
basically would um I basically would
 
03:18:50.389 --> 03:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
object to that I think that eviction pre
 
03:18:52.630 --> 03:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
proceedings should not be summary
 
03:18:54.910 --> 03:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
proceedings it actually does say in law
 
03:18:56.950 --> 03:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
and there's pretty strict time limits on
 
03:18:58.910 --> 03:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
you know various kinds of
 
03:19:01.469 --> 03:19:01.479 align:start position:0%
things uh Mr chair yeah yes the
 
03:19:04.910 --> 03:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative VI um just a question um
 
03:19:06.950 --> 03:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher have are you
 
03:19:10.150 --> 03:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
thinking also in terms of a class action
 
03:19:14.030 --> 03:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
process um yeah I mean I don't think
 
03:19:16.750 --> 03:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
that's in the bill currently but I would
 
03:19:19.950 --> 03:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
be open to that sort of
 
03:19:22.670 --> 03:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
um that sort of future
 
03:19:27.189 --> 03:19:27.199 align:start position:0%

not print enough copies there are 14
 
03:20:25.550 --> 03:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
going around but I did email the
 
03:20:32.389 --> 03:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:36.750 --> 03:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
and so hopefully it's it's in cyberspace
 
03:20:38.870 --> 03:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
getting to I just didn't expect the full
 
03:20:40.389 --> 03:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
attendance and I hate wasting paper you
 
03:20:41.510 --> 03:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
guys have really good attendance I just
 
03:20:43.309 --> 03:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
want to say all right so representative
 
03:20:46.110 --> 03:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
Jason Gard representing Franklin
 
03:20:48.590 --> 03:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
norfield and the amendment unfortunately
 
03:20:50.590 --> 03:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
changes the essence of the bill but it
 
03:20:53.870 --> 03:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:56.630 --> 03:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
sentence so I'll read it just it's one
 
03:20:58.110 --> 03:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
few sentences not withstanding any law
 
03:20:59.550 --> 03:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
to the contrary where a defendant has
 
03:21:00.870 --> 03:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
been offered a plea bargain in a
 
03:21:02.469 --> 03:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
criminal case that requires that the
 
03:21:04.590 --> 03:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
defendant be incarcerated a judge may
 
03:21:06.950 --> 03:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
not impose a period of incarceration
 
03:21:09.910 --> 03:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
that exceeds by more than 10% the length
 
03:21:11.910 --> 03:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
of incarceration contemplated in theow
 
03:21:14.750 --> 03:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
lest plea bargain sentence in cases
 
03:21:16.229 --> 03:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
where the federal government exercises
 
03:21:17.710 --> 03:21:17.720 align:start position:0%
concurrent jurisdiction over a matter
 
03:21:20.110 --> 03:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire a federal court shall
 
03:21:22.030 --> 03:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
a federal court judge shall be bound by
 
03:21:24.389 --> 03:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
this law now I understand that I'm
 
03:21:25.590 --> 03:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
standing between you and lunch so I'm
 
03:21:27.990 --> 03:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
going to go very quickly but just try to
 
03:21:31.229 --> 03:21:31.239 align:start position:0%
hang on here RSA
 
03:21:34.110 --> 03:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
1231 reads seated to the United States
 
03:21:35.550 --> 03:21:35.560 align:start position:0%

and plan of the lands so owned and

occupied verified by oath of some
 
03:21:54.830 --> 03:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
Officer United States having knowledge
 
03:21:55.990 --> 03:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
of the fact shall be filed with
 
03:21:57.830 --> 03:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
Secretary of the State and provided
 
03:21:59.189 --> 03:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
further that this
 
03:22:02.870 --> 03:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
session secession is upon the express
 
03:22:03.750 --> 03:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
condition that the state of New
 
03:22:05.790 --> 03:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire shall retain concurrent
 
03:22:07.790 --> 03:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction with the United States in
 
03:22:09.670 --> 03:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
and over all such lands so far that all
 
03:22:12.189 --> 03:22:12.199 align:start position:0%
civil and criminal process isue under
 
03:22:13.710 --> 03:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
the authority of the state may be
 
03:22:15.150 --> 03:22:15.160 align:start position:0%
executed on the said lands in any
 
03:22:17.550 --> 03:22:17.560 align:start position:0%
building now Hereafter erected thereon
 
03:22:18.950 --> 03:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
in the same way and with the same effect
 
03:22:21.030 --> 03:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
is that the statute had not been enacted
 
03:22:22.349 --> 03:22:22.359 align:start position:0%
and that exclusive jurisdiction shall
 
03:22:24.389 --> 03:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
revert to and revest in this state
 
03:22:25.910 --> 03:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
whenever the land shall cease to be the
 
03:22:28.349 --> 03:22:28.359 align:start position:0%
property of the United States that's the
 
03:22:30.950 --> 03:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
justification for also applying this
 
03:22:33.429 --> 03:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
bill to the federal court system that
 
03:22:34.990 --> 03:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has concurrent
 
03:22:38.070 --> 03:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in such realm
 
03:22:41.269 --> 03:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
so very briefly sixth amendment in all
 
03:22:42.950 --> 03:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
Criminal prosecutions the accused shall
 
03:22:44.349 --> 03:22:44.359 align:start position:0%
enjoy the right to a speedy and public
 
03:22:46.110 --> 03:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
trial by an impartial jury of the state
 
03:22:47.510 --> 03:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
and District wherein the crime shall
 
03:22:49.469 --> 03:22:49.479 align:start position:0%
have been committed which district shall
 
03:22:51.309 --> 03:22:51.319 align:start position:0%
have been previously ascertained by law
 
03:22:52.710 --> 03:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
and to be informed of the nature and
 
03:22:54.309 --> 03:22:54.319 align:start position:0%
cause of the accusation to be confronted
 
03:22:55.990 --> 03:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
with the witnesses against him to have
 
03:22:57.389 --> 03:22:57.399 align:start position:0%
compulsory process for obtaining
 
03:22:59.110 --> 03:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
Witnesses in his favor and to have
 
03:23:01.750 --> 03:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
assistance of counsel for his
 
03:23:04.229 --> 03:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
defense quote representative government
 
03:23:06.189 --> 03:23:06.199 align:start position:0%
and trial by jury are the heart and
 
03:23:08.630 --> 03:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
lungs of Liberty wrote John Adams
 
03:23:10.469 --> 03:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
without them we have no fortification
 
03:23:12.870 --> 03:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
against being ridden like horses fleeced
 
03:23:15.630 --> 03:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
like sheep worked like cattle and fed in
 
03:23:17.510 --> 03:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
clothed like swine and
 
03:23:21.550 --> 03:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
Hogs this bill seeks to prevent what is
 
03:23:23.710 --> 03:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
commonly referred to as the trial
 
03:23:26.030 --> 03:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
penalty if a defendant chooses to
 
03:23:27.389 --> 03:23:27.399 align:start position:0%
exercise their Sixth Amendment right
 
03:23:29.550 --> 03:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
which I just read trial by jury then
 
03:23:31.030 --> 03:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
they are punished with a sentence that
 
03:23:33.590 --> 03:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
is excessively larger than what the plea
 
03:23:35.550 --> 03:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
bargain was which to me doesn't make any
 
03:23:36.910 --> 03:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
sense because if the government is
 
03:23:40.710 --> 03:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
willing to give an individual a sentence
 
03:23:42.429 --> 03:23:42.439 align:start position:0%
the fact that they wish to exercise
 
03:23:44.030 --> 03:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
their constitutional right to a trial by
 
03:23:47.710 --> 03:23:47.720 align:start position:0%
jury shall not should not increase their
 
03:23:47.720 --> 03:23:49.750 align:start position:0%
jury shall not should not increase their
sentence

03:23:49.750 --> 03:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
03:23:52.030 --> 03:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
multifold so just very briefly from
 
03:23:53.189 --> 03:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
Wikipedia article that it's actually
 
03:23:54.710 --> 03:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
very well written on this just I'll just
 
03:23:58.030 --> 03:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
go very fast so in a ple baring a
 
03:23:59.229 --> 03:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
criminal defendant waves their right to
 
03:24:00.469 --> 03:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
trial and agrees to plead guilty to a
 
03:24:01.389 --> 03:24:01.399 align:start position:0%
lesser charge that would have been
 
03:24:02.790 --> 03:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
brought against them at trial or agrees
 
03:24:04.150 --> 03:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
to plead guilty to the original charge
 
03:24:05.429 --> 03:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
in exchange for a sentence that is less
 
03:24:07.189 --> 03:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
than the maximum possible plea
 
03:24:08.630 --> 03:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
bargaining is pervasive in the United
 
03:24:09.990 --> 03:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
States with most criminal defendants
 
03:24:11.349 --> 03:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
accepting a plea deal rather than going
 
03:24:13.750 --> 03:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
to trial at the federal level just 2% of
 
03:24:15.830 --> 03:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
defendants elect to go to
 
03:24:17.710 --> 03:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
trial the trial penalty is the
 
03:24:18.910 --> 03:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
discrepancy between the sentence the
 
03:24:19.910 --> 03:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
prosecutor is willing to offer an
 
03:24:21.150 --> 03:24:21.160 align:start position:0%
exchange for a guilty plea and the
 
03:24:22.670 --> 03:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
sentence that would be imposed after a
 
03:24:24.550 --> 03:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
trial many plea Bargains require that
 
03:24:25.590 --> 03:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
the defendant wave certain
 
03:24:26.870 --> 03:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights such as the right
 
03:24:28.790 --> 03:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
to challenge unlawfully procured
 
03:24:30.790 --> 03:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
evidence and the right to appeal the
 
03:24:32.349 --> 03:24:32.359 align:start position:0%
loss of these rights is also sometimes
 
03:24:34.349 --> 03:24:34.359 align:start position:0%
considered part of the trial penalty
 
03:24:35.790 --> 03:24:35.800 align:start position:0%
critics argue that trial penalty has the
 
03:24:37.269 --> 03:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
effect of depriving defendants of their
 
03:24:38.950 --> 03:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
six men the right to a speeding and
 
03:24:41.349 --> 03:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
public trial a 2015 statistical analysis
 
03:24:44.150 --> 03:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
of Federal cases by Andrew chish Kim
 
03:24:45.510 --> 03:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
concluded that defendants who exercise
 
03:24:46.910 --> 03:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
their right to trial are penalized with
 
03:24:49.110 --> 03:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
sentences 64% longer than they would
 
03:24:50.550 --> 03:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
have received had they accepted a plea
 
03:24:52.189 --> 03:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
deal Kim argues that this makes a trial
 
03:24:53.870 --> 03:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
by jury less of a right and more of a
 
03:24:56.189 --> 03:24:56.199 align:start position:0%
trap for fools the National Association
 
03:24:57.670 --> 03:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
of criminal defense lawyers has seen a
 
03:24:59.990 --> 03:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
particularly heart uh has been a
 
03:25:01.429 --> 03:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
particularly harsh critic of the trial
 
03:25:03.429 --> 03:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
penalty arguing that is now so severe
 
03:25:04.630 --> 03:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
and pervasive that has virtually
 
03:25:06.469 --> 03:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
eliminated the constitutional right to a
 
03:25:08.790 --> 03:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
trial which has had the consequence of
 
03:25:10.590 --> 03:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
replacing the system of trial by jury
 
03:25:11.550 --> 03:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
laid out in the United States
 
03:25:12.990 --> 03:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution with a system of plea
 
03:25:14.990 --> 03:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
bargain trial penalties they point out
 
03:25:16.670 --> 03:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
impose such harsh sanctions on choosing
 
03:25:20.429 --> 03:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
to go to trial with prosecutors
 
03:25:21.790 --> 03:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes threatening multi-decade
 
03:25:23.710 --> 03:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
prison sentences if a plea deal of only
 
03:25:25.750 --> 03:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
a few years is not accepted the trial
 
03:25:27.349 --> 03:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
penalties amount to coercing defendants
 
03:25:29.189 --> 03:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
to plead guilty this coercion they argue
 
03:25:32.389 --> 03:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:34.469 --> 03:25:34.479 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and it goes on but I
 
03:25:36.070 --> 03:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
think that'll cover exactly what I was
 
03:25:38.229 --> 03:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
trying to get to and just on a personal
 
03:25:41.870 --> 03:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
note my own situation in federal court I
 
03:25:43.590 --> 03:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
was offered a plea bargain right before
 
03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
trial of five 57 to 71 months and
 
03:25:48.710 --> 03:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
because I went to trial I was given 20
 
03:25:50.670 --> 03:25:50.680 align:start position:0%
years and the game is basically played
 
03:25:54.189 --> 03:25:54.199 align:start position:0%
by a adding charges or B running charges
 
03:25:55.670 --> 03:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
consecutive when they ought to be run
 
03:25:58.030 --> 03:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
concurrently at the same time and this
 
03:26:00.389 --> 03:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
happens at the state level too and
 
03:26:01.950 --> 03:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
that's why I put the bill in I think
 
03:26:03.670 --> 03:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
it's time that New Hampshire protects
 
03:26:07.550 --> 03:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
its citizens from federal abuses but
 
03:26:09.429 --> 03:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
also at state level as well you should
 
03:26:12.630 --> 03:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
not be penalized excess ly 10% I think
 
03:26:14.670 --> 03:26:14.680 align:start position:0%
is fair for the interest of efficiency
 
03:26:16.750 --> 03:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
whereas Justice shouldn't be a fast food
 
03:26:18.510 --> 03:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
restaurant it's supposed to be
 
03:26:21.469 --> 03:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
calculated and well and our rights
 
03:26:23.229 --> 03:26:23.239 align:start position:0%
should be protected especially right to
 
03:26:24.830 --> 03:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
trial by jury that comes from the Magna
 
03:26:26.710 --> 03:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
Carta that's
 
03:26:28.830 --> 03:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
fundamental to the whole American
 
03:26:30.710 --> 03:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
Experience let's say so if you have any
 
03:26:32.070 --> 03:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
questions I'll take them hopefully I
 
03:26:33.469 --> 03:26:33.479 align:start position:0%
kind of covered the basics but it's a
 
03:26:34.630 --> 03:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
pretty simple
 
03:26:37.389 --> 03:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
concept uh yes representative kab first
 
03:26:38.750 --> 03:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
and then representative Oregon
 
03:26:40.349 --> 03:26:40.359 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you Mr
 
03:26:41.790 --> 03:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
chairman I just if if you could just
 
03:26:43.790 --> 03:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
clarify what how many months did you say
 
03:26:46.150 --> 03:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
that you were offered again well I
 
03:26:48.229 --> 03:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
should I'm sorry let me clarify it again
 
03:26:50.870 --> 03:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
the guidelines I actually misspoke the
 
03:26:52.510 --> 03:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines federal guidelines called for
 
03:26:56.269 --> 03:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
57 to 71 months right before trial I was
 
03:26:58.550 --> 03:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
offered six to seven years if I played
 
03:27:01.429 --> 03:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
guilty but I refuse because I'm not
 
03:27:04.030 --> 03:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
pleading guilty
 
03:27:08.870 --> 03:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
so okay all right uh representative
 
03:27:11.389 --> 03:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
organ this sounds like a jury
 
03:27:14.389 --> 03:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
nullification bill in Reverse like we
 
03:27:16.950 --> 03:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
get bills in this committee and others
 
03:27:19.229 --> 03:27:19.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes we say the jury which I guess
 
03:27:21.269 --> 03:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
is true the jury can acquit an offended
 
03:27:24.110 --> 03:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
for without being accountable to anyone
 
03:27:27.269 --> 03:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
else but say you're saying the if the
 
03:27:29.870 --> 03:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
jury the jury sincerely feels that the
 
03:27:31.710 --> 03:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
plea bargain was too lenient for the
 
03:27:33.550 --> 03:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
offense um they should be denied to
 
03:27:36.030 --> 03:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
right at least or at least have right
 
03:27:38.189 --> 03:27:38.199 align:start position:0%
severely restricted to enforce a enforce
 
03:27:41.750 --> 03:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
a harsher sentence if they uh if they
 
03:27:45.389 --> 03:27:45.399 align:start position:0%
come to the conclusion that uh that the
 
03:27:48.269 --> 03:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
plea bargain was inappropriately uh was
 
03:27:51.910 --> 03:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
not was not as harsh as it should be and
 
03:27:54.469 --> 03:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
of course I'm a little bit confused but
 
03:27:55.870 --> 03:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
I'll just say that at least I have
 
03:27:57.030 --> 03:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
experience with the federal system not
 
03:27:58.550 --> 03:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
so much the state but at the federal
 
03:28:01.469 --> 03:28:01.479 align:start position:0%
system the jury convicts you on the
 
03:28:04.189 --> 03:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
charges but they have no input on the
 
03:28:06.150 --> 03:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
sentence which I also think is a extreme
 
03:28:08.150 --> 03:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
miscarriage of justice so the judge can
 
03:28:09.630 --> 03:28:09.640 align:start position:0%
actually consider factors that were not
 
03:28:11.870 --> 03:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
brought up at trial into the sentence
 
03:28:14.830 --> 03:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
and that also increases the sentence so
 
03:28:17.750 --> 03:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
hence the reason most people 97% plead
 
03:28:21.110 --> 03:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
out which is absurd and it's just
 
03:28:24.910 --> 03:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
so yes understand thank you thanks for
 
03:28:26.229 --> 03:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question okay you have to
 
03:28:28.469 --> 03:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
bring this I'm not a lawyer yeah neither
 
03:28:31.070 --> 03:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
am I okay so let me let me understand
 
03:28:33.349 --> 03:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
that so if you were offered five to
 
03:28:37.389 --> 03:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
seven years but you decided to go to
 
03:28:40.189 --> 03:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
trial you couldn't be offered more than
 
03:28:42.189 --> 03:28:42.199 align:start position:0%
10 they could could and you were found
 
03:28:45.830 --> 03:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
guilty they couldn't go over more than
 
03:28:47.830 --> 03:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
10% over that is that what I'm
 
03:28:48.990 --> 03:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
understanding the lowest plea bargain
 
03:28:50.389 --> 03:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
yes lowest plea
 
03:28:53.229 --> 03:28:53.239 align:start position:0%
bargain well if they thought 5 to seven
 
03:28:57.870 --> 03:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
years was enough it seems wrong that
 
03:29:00.110 --> 03:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
they went up to 20 so they punished you
 
03:29:02.830 --> 03:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
for going to trial for exercising your
 
03:29:04.830 --> 03:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
sixth amendment the right right okay
 
03:29:07.110 --> 03:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
that's fine I I get it other questions
 
03:29:10.110 --> 03:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
for this witness representative
 
03:29:10.120 --> 03:29:11.710 align:start position:0%
for this witness representative
gon

03:29:11.710 --> 03:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
gon
 
03:29:13.910 --> 03:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking our questions in a
 
03:29:17.030 --> 03:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
plea bargain are you not typically
 
03:29:20.150 --> 03:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
offered to plead guilty to lesser
 
03:29:23.269 --> 03:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
charges but if you reject that the trial
 
03:29:26.630 --> 03:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
is at the higher charges is that correct
 
03:29:28.830 --> 03:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
okay my I I guess you could yes
 
03:29:31.830 --> 03:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
technically but this is the problem if
 
03:29:34.830 --> 03:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
you are only deemed so dangerous that
 
03:29:36.990 --> 03:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
you need let's just say 10 years your
 
03:29:39.670 --> 03:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
plea bargain is 10 years how is it
 
03:29:42.030 --> 03:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
magically that after a trial you're now
 
03:29:44.429 --> 03:29:44.439 align:start position:0%
found to be so dangerous you need 20
 
03:29:46.830 --> 03:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
years that's I'm not an attorney I don't
 
03:29:48.790 --> 03:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
know I'm just trying let's just kind of
 
03:29:51.189 --> 03:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
look at the basic element to that for
 
03:29:52.950 --> 03:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
only one thing happened you said I want
 
03:29:56.590 --> 03:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:01.189 --> 03:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
right other other questions so I I guess
 
03:30:04.670 --> 03:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
the the only question I have is what I
 
03:30:07.110 --> 03:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
mean if if this were If This Were to go
 
03:30:07.120 --> 03:30:08.389 align:start position:0%
mean if if this were If This Were to go
into

03:30:08.389 --> 03:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
into
 
03:30:11.950 --> 03:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
effect wouldn't the result
 
03:30:14.349 --> 03:30:14.359 align:start position:0%
likely be
 
03:30:17.070 --> 03:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
that defendants would not get the
 
03:30:19.870 --> 03:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
benefit of lower of potentially lowered
 
03:30:22.070 --> 03:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
sentences because a prosecutor would say
 
03:30:25.309 --> 03:30:25.319 align:start position:0%
well look in the worst case scenario
 
03:30:27.550 --> 03:30:27.560 align:start position:0%
where the defendant goes wants to go to
 
03:30:29.510 --> 03:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
trial and of course the prosecutor
 
03:30:30.550 --> 03:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't know whether you're going to
 
03:30:32.870 --> 03:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
accept the agreement or not well 97% of
 
03:30:34.630 --> 03:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
the time they do okay but right so the
 
03:30:37.670 --> 03:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
prosecutor says okay if this guy does
 
03:30:41.110 --> 03:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
not accept this agreement U that I'm
 
03:30:43.550 --> 03:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
going to make what's the likely what's
 
03:30:46.590 --> 03:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
the worst sentence what what do I think
 
03:30:48.990 --> 03:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
as a prosecutor is what the sentence
 
03:30:52.950 --> 03:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
should be and okay I and so as let's
 
03:30:55.070 --> 03:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
assume in some hypothetical case I say I
 
03:30:57.189 --> 03:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
think the pro the the sentence should be
 
03:30:59.990 --> 03:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
10 years so now if this is an effect I
 
03:31:04.429 --> 03:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
know that I can't offer a sentence less
 
03:31:08.150 --> 03:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
than um uh more than 90 I mean less than
 
03:31:10.750 --> 03:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
90% of that because if I do then the
 
03:31:12.630 --> 03:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
judge will be barred from imposing what
 
03:31:15.630 --> 03:31:15.640 align:start position:0%
I think is a good sentence so why would
 
03:31:17.870 --> 03:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't I wouldn't that sort of
 
03:31:20.670 --> 03:31:20.680 align:start position:0%
discourage me from offering a lower plea
 
03:31:22.750 --> 03:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
bargain I think what would happen is you
 
03:31:24.590 --> 03:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
would fill up all the jails and prisons
 
03:31:26.070 --> 03:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
in the state and people would realize
 
03:31:27.670 --> 03:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
okay we got to start prioritizing who
 
03:31:29.229 --> 03:31:29.239 align:start position:0%
needs to be locked up instead of making
 
03:31:31.510 --> 03:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
it into the human warehousing operation
 
03:31:34.870 --> 03:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
that it is right now all right other
 
03:31:36.269 --> 03:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness
 
03:31:36.279 --> 03:31:38.469 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness
representative

03:31:38.469 --> 03:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:31:40.630 --> 03:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
Stapleton yeah thank you for taking my
 
03:31:43.349 --> 03:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
question and I a little confused over
 
03:31:43.359 --> 03:31:44.590 align:start position:0%
question and I a little confused over
this

03:31:44.590 --> 03:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:31:47.389 --> 03:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
but you were offered a were you offer a
 
03:31:50.550 --> 03:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
plea deal because you became a state's
 
03:31:54.389 --> 03:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
witness I referate other charges or I
 
03:31:57.389 --> 03:31:57.399 align:start position:0%
refus to the the time was out of
 
03:32:00.189 --> 03:32:00.199 align:start position:0%
proportion to the guidelines because the
 
03:32:02.510 --> 03:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines don't have to be they're not
 
03:32:04.670 --> 03:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
mandatory they're advisory after a
 
03:32:06.990 --> 03:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
Booker this case called Booker with a
 
03:32:10.990 --> 03:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
it's a drug case and because judges were
 
03:32:13.910 --> 03:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
um hamstrung and had to impose sentences
 
03:32:15.229 --> 03:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
according to the guideline even when
 
03:32:16.790 --> 03:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
they didn't believe that that harsh
 
03:32:19.670 --> 03:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
sentence was justified so because the
 
03:32:23.030 --> 03:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines are option um advisory now
 
03:32:24.990 --> 03:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
they can just go way above way below
 
03:32:27.189 --> 03:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's just a
 
03:32:29.550 --> 03:32:29.560 align:start position:0%
free-for-all other questions for this
 
03:32:31.910 --> 03:32:31.920 align:start position:0%

1497 seeing none I'm going to close the

standards and I recognize uh
 
04:10:06.429 --> 04:10:06.439 align:start position:0%

04:10:09.990 --> 04:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:12.269 --> 04:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman members of Judiciary
 
04:10:13.910 --> 04:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative hle serving the towns of
 
04:10:17.750 --> 04:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
Dunbarton hooks at Allenstown and epsom
 
04:10:20.109 --> 04:10:20.119 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of House Bill 1640
 
04:10:22.670 --> 04:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
relative to qualified immunity
 
04:10:24.750 --> 04:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
standards similar bills to this have
 
04:10:27.070 --> 04:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
been before this committee I was looking
 
04:10:29.550 --> 04:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
back probably every year almost every
 
04:10:33.349 --> 04:10:33.359 align:start position:0%
session for the last several sessions um
 
04:10:35.469 --> 04:10:35.479 align:start position:0%
it keeps coming up and the question
 
04:10:38.750 --> 04:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
before us at the highest level
 
04:10:43.109 --> 04:10:43.119 align:start position:0%
is when does uh someone acting on behalf
 
04:10:44.149 --> 04:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:10:46.990 --> 04:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
state have some responsibility in the
 
04:10:48.670 --> 04:10:48.680 align:start position:0%
decisions they're
 
04:10:51.070 --> 04:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
making in the engineering world if I
 
04:10:53.469 --> 04:10:53.479 align:start position:0%
have lots of time to do a risk analysis
 
04:10:55.510 --> 04:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
I'm fully responsible as an engineer in
 
04:10:58.630 --> 04:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
the decisions that I make hence we do
 
04:11:00.189 --> 04:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
all sorts of testing to make sure the
 
04:11:01.750 --> 04:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
products that I
 
04:11:06.109 --> 04:11:06.119 align:start position:0%
design are going to work in the intended
 
04:11:08.990 --> 04:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
Market there 's a difference between
 
04:11:10.510 --> 04:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
someone working and having to make a
 
04:11:12.750 --> 04:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
split second decision and I see a a
 
04:11:14.590 --> 04:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
bunch of gentlemen behind me or officers
 
04:11:16.550 --> 04:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
behind me who are faced every day with
 
04:11:18.389 --> 04:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
making split-second decisions and this
 
04:11:21.149 --> 04:11:21.159 align:start position:0%
bill in fact speaks to that and I will I
 
04:11:22.710 --> 04:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
will get to
 
04:11:24.950 --> 04:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
that but there's a difference between
 
04:11:29.189 --> 04:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
that and whether it's a local employee a
 
04:11:31.710 --> 04:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
state employee who has months to think
 
04:11:34.149 --> 04:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
about a
 
04:11:37.109 --> 04:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
decision and still makes a bad choice
 
04:11:40.550 --> 04:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
where where does qualified immunity
 
04:11:43.830 --> 04:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
end does it end a minute later does it
 
04:11:47.109 --> 04:11:47.119 align:start position:0%
end 10 minutes later does it end a week
 
04:11:49.590 --> 04:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
later a month later when does when does
 
04:11:51.070 --> 04:11:51.080 align:start position:0%
how much time do they get to make a
 
04:11:53.790 --> 04:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
decision before qualified immunity no
 
04:11:53.800 --> 04:11:55.710 align:start position:0%
decision before qualified immunity no
longer

04:11:55.710 --> 04:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
longer
 
04:11:58.109 --> 04:11:58.119 align:start position:0%
applies it's a good question I think
 
04:11:59.910 --> 04:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
this committee is is the right committee
 
04:12:01.630 --> 04:12:01.640 align:start position:0%
to start thinking about
 
04:12:04.750 --> 04:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
this and the reason I say that I'm going
 
04:12:07.830 --> 04:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
to bring up in in a case of my own
 
04:12:09.510 --> 04:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
personal family
 
04:12:12.389 --> 04:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
experience I had a state employee State
 
04:12:15.469 --> 04:12:15.479 align:start position:0%
actor who thought my son was in danger
 
04:12:18.630 --> 04:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
of imminent coma or death imminent being
 
04:12:21.269 --> 04:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
an operative word they went to the
 
04:12:25.790 --> 04:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
courts and got um an exp parte
 
04:12:28.870 --> 04:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
hearing and they came to pick up my son
 
04:12:31.030 --> 04:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
well that's fine he wasn't in imminent
 
04:12:33.189 --> 04:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
danger of K death I saw him just before
 
04:12:35.510 --> 04:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
I left to drive up here this is almost
 
04:12:38.990 --> 04:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
two years ago however that department
 
04:12:41.550 --> 04:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
continued to pursue that case for four
 
04:12:44.790 --> 04:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
months at what point does the department
 
04:12:46.950 --> 04:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
have some responsibility for their
 
04:12:51.269 --> 04:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
actions to continue to harm the citizens
 
04:12:53.790 --> 04:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:57.670 --> 04:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
state when does qualified immunity kick
 
04:12:59.910 --> 04:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
in the men and women behind me in
 
04:13:01.750 --> 04:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
uniform which are going to be here to
 
04:13:04.590 --> 04:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
testify against this are faced every day
 
04:13:06.670 --> 04:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
with a split-second decision but the
 
04:13:09.710 --> 04:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
bill specifically carves out what they
 
04:13:11.910 --> 04:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
have to do in various sections and I
 
04:13:14.670 --> 04:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:18.550 --> 04:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
quote um page two of the bill not
 
04:13:20.750 --> 04:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
including the header right page two
 
04:13:23.269 --> 04:13:23.279 align:start position:0%

541 B27 right when evaluating a
 
04:13:56.790 --> 04:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
government employees use of force under
 
04:13:58.510 --> 04:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
under the constitution of this state or
 
04:14:00.429 --> 04:14:00.439 align:start position:0%

determination of reasonableness shall be
 
04:14:04.309 --> 04:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
objective and made from the perspective
 
04:14:06.149 --> 04:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
of a reasonable government employee who
 
04:14:07.630 --> 04:14:07.640 align:start position:0%
was on the scene confr Ed with the
 
04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
immediate facts and circumstances of the
 
04:14:12.830 --> 04:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
claim why is that in there that's in
 
04:14:15.030 --> 04:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
there to address the concerns that are
 
04:14:18.070 --> 04:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
going to be raised after I speak because
 
04:14:21.389 --> 04:14:21.399 align:start position:0%
we don't get the chance to have we we're
 
04:14:22.950 --> 04:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
as Citizens we don't make those Split
 
04:14:25.790 --> 04:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
Second decisions but the reality is some
 
04:14:28.269 --> 04:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
people are tasked by our government with
 
04:14:30.750 --> 04:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
making split-second decisions and they
 
04:14:32.389 --> 04:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be second guess when you've
 
04:14:35.189 --> 04:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
got hours and days to think about
 
04:14:38.189 --> 04:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
it I think the issue that needs to be
 
04:14:40.870 --> 04:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
addressed is when you have time to do a
 
04:14:43.510 --> 04:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
true risk analysis of what's going
 
04:14:46.269 --> 04:14:46.279 align:start position:0%
on is the person in danger of imminent
 
04:14:48.309 --> 04:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
coma or death four months after the EXP
 
04:14:50.269 --> 04:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
parte hearing for
 
04:14:54.710 --> 04:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
example was that should that behavior be
 
04:14:57.469 --> 04:14:57.479 align:start position:0%
covered under our qualified immunity
 
04:15:00.750 --> 04:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
standards as a parent I would say no as
 
04:15:02.950 --> 04:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
the parent of a child who was harmed by
 
04:15:05.189 --> 04:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
these actions I would say
 
04:15:09.790 --> 04:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
no we owe our citizens more than
 
04:15:12.389 --> 04:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
that there is a point in time where
 
04:15:14.550 --> 04:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
someone making a decision has the
 
04:15:17.510 --> 04:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
ability to think about the consequences
 
04:15:21.389 --> 04:15:21.399 align:start position:0%
of their decision and at that point in
 
04:15:25.590 --> 04:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
time they are now they they now own a
 
04:15:27.630 --> 04:15:27.640 align:start position:0%
portion of that decision and the longer
 
04:15:29.870 --> 04:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
the time goes between when they' first
 
04:15:31.229 --> 04:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
had the chance to think about the
 
04:15:33.109 --> 04:15:33.119 align:start position:0%
consequences and when they make the
 
04:15:35.389 --> 04:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
actual decision it goes from no
 
04:15:39.990 --> 04:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
percentage a 0% ownership to
 
04:15:42.830 --> 04:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
100% if you're if you have weeks to
 
04:15:45.830 --> 04:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
think about a decision and you've and
 
04:15:47.790 --> 04:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
you've had group meetings over the
 
04:15:50.309 --> 04:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
decision and involved others and been to
 
04:15:53.030 --> 04:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
the court multiple times and you've had
 
04:15:55.510 --> 04:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
doctors tell you this is a bad idea I
 
04:15:57.910 --> 04:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
think you own the
 
04:15:59.910 --> 04:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
decision we shouldn't be extending
 
04:16:02.710 --> 04:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity it ruins the purpose
 
04:16:04.790 --> 04:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
of that in fact I would argue the
 
04:16:07.229 --> 04:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
officers behind me don't benefit from
 
04:16:10.710 --> 04:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity when others blatantly
 
04:16:13.389 --> 04:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
violate the intent of that section of
 
04:16:16.790 --> 04:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
law this bill addresses it I would ask
 
04:16:18.790 --> 04:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
that you would pass House Bill
 
04:16:22.910 --> 04:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
1640 um as filed so that we can start to
 
04:16:24.750 --> 04:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
address this with that I'll take any
 
04:16:27.109 --> 04:16:27.119 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any questions for
 
04:16:29.349 --> 04:16:29.359 align:start position:0%
this representative Perez thank you
 
04:16:31.550 --> 04:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so the
 
04:16:34.990 --> 04:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
way this bill difference differs from
 
04:16:38.429 --> 04:16:38.439 align:start position:0%
last year's bill is that you see that we
 
04:16:42.109 --> 04:16:42.119 align:start position:0%
are now actually protecting our uh law
 
04:16:45.309 --> 04:16:45.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement and others who make those
 
04:16:48.590 --> 04:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
split SEC second decision decision it
 
04:16:51.870 --> 04:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
actually it actually uses the word on P
 
04:16:55.070 --> 04:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page three yeah starting
 
04:16:57.469 --> 04:16:57.479 align:start position:0%
in line 34 the court shall recognize
 
04:16:59.550 --> 04:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
that a government employee often must
 
04:17:01.710 --> 04:17:01.720 align:start position:0%
make a split-second decision intense
 
04:17:03.630 --> 04:17:03.640 align:start position:0%
uncertain and rapidly evolving
 
04:17:06.429 --> 04:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
situations sounds like police work yeah
 
04:17:07.710 --> 04:17:07.720 align:start position:0%
the court shall not determine
 
04:17:10.109 --> 04:17:10.119 align:start position:0%
reasonableness using hindsight or based
 
04:17:11.750 --> 04:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
on facts and circumstances that are
 
04:17:11.760 --> 04:17:12.790 align:start position:0%
on facts and circumstances that are
later

04:17:12.790 --> 04:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
later
 
04:17:14.830 --> 04:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
discovered that's
 
04:17:14.840 --> 04:17:17.070 align:start position:0%
discovered that's
different

04:17:17.070 --> 04:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:17:21.149 --> 04:17:21.159 align:start position:0%
than someone who gets weeks in our case
 
04:17:23.910 --> 04:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
months to weigh out a decision and still
 
04:17:25.710 --> 04:17:25.720 align:start position:0%
insists that my son shouldn't belong
 
04:17:28.070 --> 04:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
with our household and he has trouble
 
04:17:30.030 --> 04:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
sleeping every night wondering is
 
04:17:32.550 --> 04:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
tomorrow the day the two police officers
 
04:17:34.510 --> 04:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
show up a second time to try and take me
 
04:17:36.790 --> 04:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
from my household do I get to sleep with
 
04:17:39.990 --> 04:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
with my dog tomorrow night I challenge
 
04:17:41.910 --> 04:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
any one of you in this committee to have
 
04:17:43.990 --> 04:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
that conversation with my son cuz he
 
04:17:47.389 --> 04:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
will tell you what it felt like no
 
04:17:49.469 --> 04:17:49.479 align:start position:0%
13-year-old should be subject to that
 
04:17:52.590 --> 04:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
type of harm the state owns
 
04:17:55.469 --> 04:17:55.479 align:start position:0%
that could we have sued
 
04:17:57.429 --> 04:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's not how we approached
 
04:17:58.830 --> 04:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
it as a family we should fix it
 
04:18:00.269 --> 04:18:00.279 align:start position:0%
legislatively and the way to fix it
 
04:18:02.630 --> 04:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
legislatively is there is a there is a
 
04:18:04.510 --> 04:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
Time domain from when the decision needs
 
04:18:06.269 --> 04:18:06.279 align:start position:0%
to be made and someone has to make
 
04:18:08.189 --> 04:18:08.199 align:start position:0%
someone has to make the decision to when
 
04:18:10.229 --> 04:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
they get to make it and the longer that
 
04:18:12.309 --> 04:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
time domain the more the individual
 
04:18:14.349 --> 04:18:14.359 align:start position:0%
Bears the responsibility cuz they can
 
04:18:15.990 --> 04:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
think and weigh the consequences of
 
04:18:16.000 --> 04:18:18.750 align:start position:0%
think and weigh the consequences of
their

04:18:18.750 --> 04:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:21.590 --> 04:18:21.600 align:start position:0%

employees Association local
 
04:19:03.910 --> 04:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
1984 I come before you today to oppose
 
04:19:06.870 --> 04:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1640 and report it out of
 
04:19:08.710 --> 04:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
your committee as inexpedient to
 
04:19:11.309 --> 04:19:11.319 align:start position:0%
legislate just as you did last session
 
04:19:12.990 --> 04:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
04:19:16.149 --> 04:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
647 the Practical effect of this bill if
 
04:19:18.630 --> 04:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
enacted would be devastating to all
 
04:19:20.870 --> 04:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
public employees I believe your
 
04:19:22.349 --> 04:19:22.359 align:start position:0%
committee took an appropriate action
 
04:19:24.189 --> 04:19:24.199 align:start position:0%
last year on House Bill
 
04:19:26.910 --> 04:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
647 as it was most far-reaching and
 
04:19:29.670 --> 04:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
damaging legislation to public employees
 
04:19:31.830 --> 04:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
that I have ever seen presented to this
 
04:19:35.630 --> 04:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
house house bill 1640 this year is no
 
04:19:37.990 --> 04:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
different I will speak to the impact
 
04:19:39.590 --> 04:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
this bill would have on all public
 
04:19:42.189 --> 04:19:42.199 align:start position:0%
employees and rely on others to explain
 
04:19:44.590 --> 04:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
the dramatic increases in cost to our
 
04:19:48.229 --> 04:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
state county and local governments and
 
04:19:50.990 --> 04:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers this bill would destroy the
 
04:19:52.950 --> 04:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
protections of all public employees
 
04:19:55.469 --> 04:19:55.479 align:start position:0%
currently have which allows for the
 
04:19:57.910 --> 04:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
orderly administration of government and
 
04:20:00.229 --> 04:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
for public to be served in a more
 
04:20:03.550 --> 04:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
adequate manner the unprecedented
 
04:20:05.870 --> 04:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
exposure this bill brings to all public
 
04:20:08.670 --> 04:20:08.680 align:start position:0%

service excuse me House Bill 1640 would
 
04:20:26.389 --> 04:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
eliminate the protections of collective
 
04:20:29.070 --> 04:20:29.080 align:start position:0%

circumstances for these reasons please
 
04:23:14.790 --> 04:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
recommend that house bill 1640 be an
 
04:23:16.750 --> 04:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate so that our

04:23:24.189 --> 04:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
they do thank you for your time

04:23:36.630 --> 04:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
testerman this would aage or this this
 
04:23:40.630 --> 04:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
bill attempts to correct a problem or at
 
04:23:43.710 --> 04:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
least what a perceived problem what way
 
04:23:47.710 --> 04:23:47.720 align:start position:0%
would you do otherwise you know this
 
04:23:50.510 --> 04:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't do it what would you do to
 
04:23:52.510 --> 04:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
to correct that I think this bill
 
04:23:54.910 --> 04:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
creates more problems no not that not
 
04:23:57.349 --> 04:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
that it creates more problems what would
 
04:24:04.830 --> 04:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:07.149 --> 04:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
problems can you give me an example cuz
 
04:24:09.550 --> 04:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing the problems that you're
 
04:24:12.109 --> 04:24:12.119 align:start position:0%
you're you're talking about just look at
 
04:24:14.510 --> 04:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative H
 
04:24:18.750 --> 04:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
situation he he he gets a A Child taken
 
04:24:21.389 --> 04:24:21.399 align:start position:0%
away or or the potential of a child
 
04:24:25.950 --> 04:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
taken away and it obviously was wrong
 
04:24:28.510 --> 04:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
how would you how would you correct that
 
04:24:32.030 --> 04:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:34.149 --> 04:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
law I would have to give that some time
 
04:24:35.710 --> 04:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
but I certainly wouldn't correct it this
 
04:24:35.720 --> 04:24:39.469 align:start position:0%
but I certainly wouldn't correct it this
way

04:24:39.469 --> 04:24:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:41.070 --> 04:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
other questions for this word yes
 
04:24:45.030 --> 04:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative oron yes the
 
04:24:47.149 --> 04:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
well first all I guess asking about
 
04:24:49.429 --> 04:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
something I saw in a another bill which
 
04:24:50.710 --> 04:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
was similar which is over in the other
 
04:24:52.550 --> 04:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
body on really a topic but they had a
 
04:24:55.389 --> 04:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
line in there if you did um not just
 
04:24:56.910 --> 04:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
state employees but I think probably
 
04:24:58.910 --> 04:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
anybody who did certain things would
 
04:25:00.950 --> 04:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
have a waiver of sovereign immunity
 
04:25:04.870 --> 04:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
which seemed uh but see I think looks
 
04:25:06.750 --> 04:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
like the way this bill is written you
 
04:25:08.870 --> 04:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
have almost a universal waiver of
 
04:25:11.990 --> 04:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
sovereign imunity I'm trying because it
 
04:25:14.229 --> 04:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
seems to be tied to like a violation of
 
04:25:15.830 --> 04:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
any constitutional right which seems to
 
04:25:19.109 --> 04:25:19.119 align:start position:0%
be uh could apply to any dispute between
 
04:25:21.429 --> 04:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
a citizen and a government official who
 
04:25:23.070 --> 04:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
takes an action that the citizen doesn't
 
04:25:26.389 --> 04:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
like so this do this so you think this
 
04:25:28.510 --> 04:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
remounts a to almost like a total waiver
 
04:25:30.550 --> 04:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
of elimination of sovereign immunity if
 
04:25:34.269 --> 04:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:38.429 --> 04:25:38.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:39.910 --> 04:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
I think ultimately the state or the
 
04:25:42.030 --> 04:25:42.040 align:start position:0%
county or the municipality is liable but
 
04:25:43.710 --> 04:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
I think if you start putting switching
 
04:25:45.670 --> 04:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
that liability the individual employee
 
04:25:47.990 --> 04:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
you're you're going to have a a a
 
04:25:48.000 --> 04:25:51.950 align:start position:0%
you're you're going to have a a a
chilling

04:25:51.950 --> 04:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:55.710 --> 04:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
effect other questions for this
 
04:25:58.590 --> 04:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
witness oh yes representative
 
04:26:02.429 --> 04:26:02.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:05.750 --> 04:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
questions does the individual citizen
 
04:26:08.870 --> 04:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
have have the right to hold public
 
04:26:11.229 --> 04:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
employees accountable for their actions
 
04:26:15.269 --> 04:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
when they are acting in an official
 
04:26:18.550 --> 04:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
capacity and if they do have that right
 
04:26:26.590 --> 04:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:29.149 --> 04:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
right depending on the circumstance I
 
04:26:30.950 --> 04:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
think they would hold the employer
 
04:26:32.870 --> 04:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
accountable and then the employer May
 
04:26:35.189 --> 04:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
hold that employee accountable but I
 
04:26:37.790 --> 04:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
think the the the direct going after the
 
04:26:39.389 --> 04:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
employee is going to have a chilling
 
04:26:42.590 --> 04:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
effect the way this legislation is
 
04:26:45.349 --> 04:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
written yes follow would you please
 
04:26:46.910 --> 04:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
define chilling effect because I've
 
04:26:48.750 --> 04:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
heard that about five or six times on
 
04:26:51.750 --> 04:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
five or six different bills and other
 
04:26:53.269 --> 04:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
than global warming I'm not sure what
 
04:26:55.309 --> 04:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
chilling effect means well I think what
 
04:26:57.790 --> 04:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
it means is if being a Public Employee
 
04:27:00.550 --> 04:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
if I know I can I can be sued for making
 
04:27:02.950 --> 04:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
a decision individually or terminated
 
04:27:04.830 --> 04:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
for that why would I go to work for that
 
04:27:06.469 --> 04:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
public entity
 
04:27:07.510 --> 04:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
why would
 
04:27:10.269 --> 04:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
you representative foret thank you for
 
04:27:12.790 --> 04:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:15.990 --> 04:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
question are there other groups I'm not
 
04:27:20.309 --> 04:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
a lawyer Nei I was a nurse for 42 years
 
04:27:22.309 --> 04:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
I did not have qualified
 
04:27:26.229 --> 04:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
immunity um if I made a mistake I was
 
04:27:28.670 --> 04:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
responsible for it I could be sued as an
 
04:27:30.469 --> 04:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
individual now that's why I carried
 
04:27:32.950 --> 04:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
malpractice insurance I'm just wondering
 
04:27:36.550 --> 04:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
other than state and local employees
 
04:27:41.149 --> 04:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
what other groups in um New
 
04:27:44.429 --> 04:27:44.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are covered by qualified
 
04:27:46.510 --> 04:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
immunity I don't know the answer to that
 
04:27:49.030 --> 04:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
right now I'd have to get back to
 
04:27:52.469 --> 04:27:52.479 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Municipal Association and we
 
04:28:19.510 --> 04:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
are here this afternoon in opposition to
 
04:28:20.830 --> 04:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:28:23.950 --> 04:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
1640 so far in the presentations on this
 
04:28:26.269 --> 04:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
bill there's been a lot of focus on
 
04:28:28.870 --> 04:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity but it's important to
 
04:28:30.910 --> 04:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
note that this bill is about a lot more
 
04:28:33.790 --> 04:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
than qualified immunity and it's about a
 
04:28:35.550 --> 04:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
lot more than claims against police
 
04:28:37.830 --> 04:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
offic officers and it's about a lot more
 
04:28:41.070 --> 04:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
than claims against the state under this
 
04:28:43.750 --> 04:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
bill local governments are included in
 
04:28:45.790 --> 04:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
the definition of government so even
 
04:28:47.710 --> 04:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
though the language of the bill would be
 
04:28:50.830 --> 04:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
put into RSA chapter 541b we see
 
04:28:53.269 --> 04:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
government being defied broadly as any
 
04:28:55.229 --> 04:28:55.239 align:start position:0%
County municipality political
 
04:28:57.309 --> 04:28:57.319 align:start position:0%
subdivision as well as any government
 
04:28:59.790 --> 04:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
employer being defined in the same
 
04:29:02.870 --> 04:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
manner the bill creates a cause of
 
04:29:06.429 --> 04:29:06.439 align:start position:0%
action for a violation of any right
 
04:29:08.429 --> 04:29:08.439 align:start position:0%
enumerated in the New Hampshire
 
04:29:11.149 --> 04:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
Constitution or the United States
 
04:29:13.149 --> 04:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
Constitution currently there are very
 
04:29:15.950 --> 04:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
few constitutional sections that include
 
04:29:18.469 --> 04:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
a right of action and even not all
 
04:29:20.950 --> 04:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
federal sections are actionable or
 
04:29:23.189 --> 04:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
establish a right to private
 
04:29:25.590 --> 04:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
damages and currently under some
 
04:29:27.710 --> 04:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances if the circumstances
 
04:29:30.590 --> 04:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
justify it there are immunities that can
 
04:29:33.309 --> 04:29:33.319 align:start position:0%
apply to constitutional claims but under
 
04:29:35.469 --> 04:29:35.479 align:start position:0%
this bill all of those immunities would
 
04:29:36.910 --> 04:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
be wiped
 
04:29:40.030 --> 04:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
out in addition the bill creates fee
 
04:29:42.550 --> 04:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
shifting by requiring the government to
 
04:29:44.630 --> 04:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
play to pay plaintiff's attorney's fees
 
04:29:47.469 --> 04:29:47.479 align:start position:0%
and costs if the plaintiff prevails and
 
04:29:50.349 --> 04:29:50.359 align:start position:0%
it also includes consequent shifting
 
04:29:52.670 --> 04:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
meaning it would be the employer not the
 
04:29:55.550 --> 04:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
employee that would be liable regardless
 
04:29:57.910 --> 04:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
of the circumstances regardless of
 
04:29:59.429 --> 04:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
whether there was any action the
 
04:30:02.550 --> 04:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
municipality did take or didn't take
 
04:30:05.790 --> 04:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
under the circumstances of the case in
 
04:30:07.550 --> 04:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
addition to paying the cost of
 
04:30:10.229 --> 04:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
litigation and increased litigation in
 
04:30:12.710 --> 04:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
addition to the cost of plaintiff's fees
 
04:30:15.149 --> 04:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
and and attorneys fees and costs
 
04:30:17.349 --> 04:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
Insurance costs would certainly go up
 
04:30:19.269 --> 04:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
and all of these costs would be passed
 
04:30:22.870 --> 04:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
on to the municipal
 
04:30:25.309 --> 04:30:25.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayer um there was a sub a
 
04:30:27.070 --> 04:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
substantially similar bill in this
 
04:30:29.830 --> 04:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
committee last year as you know um that
 
04:30:31.510 --> 04:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
bill did many of the things that this
 
04:30:34.469 --> 04:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
bill does and this committee saw fit to
 
04:30:36.389 --> 04:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
recommend that bill as an expedient to
 
04:30:39.149 --> 04:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
legislate 163 the issues that were
 
04:30:41.389 --> 04:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
presented last year continue to be
 
04:30:43.630 --> 04:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
present in this bill although this bill
 
04:30:45.830 --> 04:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
is in a different form than the language
 
04:30:48.030 --> 04:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
last year so we respectfully asked this
 
04:30:50.189 --> 04:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
committee to once again recommend this
 
04:30:52.349 --> 04:30:52.359 align:start position:0%
bill as inexpedient to legislate thank
 
04:30:55.030 --> 04:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
you questions for this witness
 
04:30:56.750 --> 04:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
 
04:30:58.750 --> 04:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:31:02.309 --> 04:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
um you've been in the the uh the battle
 
04:31:03.910 --> 04:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
on qualified immunity for a few years
 
04:31:05.149 --> 04:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
can you talk to me a little bit about
 
04:31:07.870 --> 04:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
how this bill is different from previous
 
04:31:10.389 --> 04:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
bills that this committee has heard this
 
04:31:13.630 --> 04:31:13.640 align:start position:0%
bill is I'm going to try to remember all
 
04:31:15.670 --> 04:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
the bills that this committee has heard
 
04:31:16.990 --> 04:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's very different
 
04:31:18.950 --> 04:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
about this bill is that the language is
 
04:31:20.870 --> 04:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
being put into an entirely different
 
04:31:22.910 --> 04:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
statute so it's being put into a statute
 
04:31:24.870 --> 04:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
that pertains to claims against the
 
04:31:28.309 --> 04:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
state but it's clearly a section that
 
04:31:30.469 --> 04:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
would have to do with claims against all
 
04:31:32.269 --> 04:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions as well as the
 
04:31:35.750 --> 04:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
state it also broadly would create a
 
04:31:38.910 --> 04:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
cause of action under any of our New
 
04:31:41.590 --> 04:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire enumerated rights under the
 
04:31:43.750 --> 04:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution as well as
 
04:31:45.670 --> 04:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
under any right under the United States
 
04:31:48.349 --> 04:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution so that that's very broad
 
04:31:50.670 --> 04:31:50.680 align:start position:0%
language um and there's little guidance
 
04:31:54.309 --> 04:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
and little statutory basis to adjudicate
 
04:31:56.309 --> 04:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
claims that could be brought under any
 
04:31:59.149 --> 04:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
of those Provisions um I believe it is
 
04:32:01.990 --> 04:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
also different in shifting both
 
04:32:04.309 --> 04:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
consequences and costs entirely to the
 
04:32:06.670 --> 04:32:06.680 align:start position:0%
employer I can't remember that
 
04:32:08.269 --> 04:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
specifically but that's an very
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
important point in this bill is that
 
04:32:12.349 --> 04:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
regardless of what actions the employer
 
04:32:14.790 --> 04:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
took to properly trained to properly
 
04:32:17.670 --> 04:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
supervise if an employee acts improperly
 
04:32:19.950 --> 04:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
the employer is on the
 
04:32:23.429 --> 04:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
hook yes um is the is there a negligence
 
04:32:27.269 --> 04:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
standard so I'm seeing as in um for
 
04:32:29.229 --> 04:32:29.239 align:start position:0%
instance our new um Constitutional
 
04:32:31.630 --> 04:32:31.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment on privacy if a government
 
04:32:33.670 --> 04:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
agency knowingly or unknowingly violates
 
04:32:35.630 --> 04:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
that right to privacy that would would
 
04:32:38.710 --> 04:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
then be subject to if this was law that
 
04:32:41.389 --> 04:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
violation would be subject as well is or
 
04:32:43.070 --> 04:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
is is the standard if they knowingly did
 
04:32:46.429 --> 04:32:46.439 align:start position:0%
it if they did it on purpose the only
 
04:32:48.469 --> 04:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
standard in this
 
04:32:51.149 --> 04:32:51.159 align:start position:0%
bill is the standard on the bottom of
 
04:32:54.030 --> 04:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
page three starting at line
 
04:32:56.870 --> 04:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
31 which specifically applies to use of
 
04:32:59.469 --> 04:32:59.479 align:start position:0%
force it is not a standard to be used
 
04:33:02.309 --> 04:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
for evaluating any other claim that
 
04:33:03.870 --> 04:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
could be brought under any other
 
04:33:05.709 --> 04:33:05.719 align:start position:0%
provision in the New Hampshire or United
 
04:33:08.310 --> 04:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
States Constitution that's helpful thank
 
04:33:11.429 --> 04:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
you other questions for this
 
04:33:14.551 --> 04:33:14.561 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
04:33:23.109 --> 04:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:25.910 --> 04:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
ramsy thank you Mr chairman hello
 
04:33:28.551 --> 04:33:28.561 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh I am Senior
 
04:33:30.670 --> 04:33:30.680 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General Jennifer
 
04:33:32.830 --> 04:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
Ramsey and I work in the unit of the
 
04:33:34.789 --> 04:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office that defends
 
04:33:37.470 --> 04:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
the state and its employees against
 
04:33:40.349 --> 04:33:40.359 align:start position:0%
lawsuits brought against it um we filed
 
04:33:43.230 --> 04:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note in this case and I in this
 
04:33:44.949 --> 04:33:44.959 align:start position:0%
uh bill and I wanted to also come and
 
04:33:46.390 --> 04:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
share with you some of our thoughts
 
04:33:48.789 --> 04:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
about how this legislation if it were
 
04:33:51.709 --> 04:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
passed would impact um our work in
 
04:33:53.869 --> 04:33:53.879 align:start position:0%
defending the state and its employees
 
04:33:56.590 --> 04:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
and also the state's um liability
 
04:33:58.830 --> 04:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
ultimately um it's our view that this
 
04:34:01.390 --> 04:34:01.400 align:start position:0%
bill would significantly increase the
 
04:34:04.269 --> 04:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
volume and cost of litigation against
 
04:34:09.029 --> 04:34:09.039 align:start position:0%
the state uh it appears to wipe out all
 
04:34:11.349 --> 04:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
immunities for constitutional rights
 
04:34:13.629 --> 04:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
claims against the state except for
 
04:34:16.750 --> 04:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
legislative and judicial immunity we
 
04:34:19.150 --> 04:34:19.160 align:start position:0%
already defend and indemnify against
 
04:34:22.390 --> 04:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
claims for damages against uh state
 
04:34:24.830 --> 04:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
employees and the state on a routine
 
04:34:27.670 --> 04:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
basis um the difference in the lack of
 
04:34:30.750 --> 04:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
the immunities would be that our policy
 
04:34:32.709 --> 04:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
makers and even our Rank and file
 
04:34:35.429 --> 04:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
employees would not be entitled to to
 
04:34:38.390 --> 04:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
the same benefit of the doubt and uh
 
04:34:40.990 --> 04:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
although the bill carves out hindsight
 
04:34:44.949 --> 04:34:44.959 align:start position:0%
as a uh a reason you cannot judge the
 
04:34:46.670 --> 04:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
conduct of a police officer in the case
 
04:34:49.150 --> 04:34:49.160 align:start position:0%
of use of force there's no similar carve
 
04:34:52.230 --> 04:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
out for any other state actor so in
 
04:34:55.349 --> 04:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
cases against uh most state
 
04:34:57.789 --> 04:34:57.799 align:start position:0%
employees uh the tri fact would be
 
04:35:00.230 --> 04:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
entitled to use the benefit of hindsight
 
04:35:02.310 --> 04:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
to judge that employees conduct and
 
04:35:04.869 --> 04:35:04.879 align:start position:0%
you're exposing the state to liability
 
04:35:08.789 --> 04:35:08.799 align:start position:0%
for for uh conduct when an actor could
 
04:35:10.670 --> 04:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
reasonably have believed that everything
 
04:35:13.230 --> 04:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
he or she was doing was lawful um but
 
04:35:15.510 --> 04:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
nevertheless once a court declares that
 
04:35:18.750 --> 04:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
that was not a lawful act then that is
 
04:35:21.429 --> 04:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
going to create exposure for the
 
04:35:24.910 --> 04:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
State uh I Al we my office also has a
 
04:35:27.629 --> 04:35:27.639 align:start position:0%
concern um that this piece of
 
04:35:30.269 --> 04:35:30.279 align:start position:0%
legislation applies not only to
 
04:35:32.910 --> 04:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
employees but to contractors for the
 
04:35:36.349 --> 04:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
state um when we contract with someone
 
04:35:37.750 --> 04:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
the Hallmark of that contract
 
04:35:40.429 --> 04:35:40.439 align:start position:0%
relationship is that we do not supervise
 
04:35:42.470 --> 04:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
that individual we do not train that
 
04:35:46.029 --> 04:35:46.039 align:start position:0%
individual um if if we do those things
 
04:35:48.349 --> 04:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
then that's an employee not a contractor
 
04:35:53.310 --> 04:35:53.320 align:start position:0%
so you would be um having the state
 
04:35:56.590 --> 04:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
defend and indemnify contractors when we
 
04:35:59.189 --> 04:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
have no control over their actions um
 
04:36:01.670 --> 04:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
the bill would
 
04:36:05.470 --> 04:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
also um kind of eviscerate the language
 
04:36:08.551 --> 04:36:08.561 align:start position:0%
in the state's standard contract the p37
 
04:36:11.670 --> 04:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
which permits and requires those
 
04:36:14.150 --> 04:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
contractors to indify the state when
 
04:36:16.629 --> 04:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
they when they commit acts of
 
04:36:21.109 --> 04:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
negligence um the bill would also carve
 
04:36:23.551 --> 04:36:23.561 align:start position:0%
out an exception from how our office
 
04:36:25.390 --> 04:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes declines to represent and
 
04:36:28.551 --> 04:36:28.561 align:start position:0%
indemnify state employees when we make a
 
04:36:32.230 --> 04:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
determination that their conduct is um
 
04:36:32.240 --> 04:36:34.070 align:start position:0%
determination that their conduct is um
is

04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:36:38.029 --> 04:36:38.039 align:start position:0%
um extremely inappropriate uh and and
 
04:36:40.029 --> 04:36:40.039 align:start position:0%
currently that serves as a disincentive
 
04:36:44.189 --> 04:36:44.199 align:start position:0%
to those individuals um to engage in um
 
04:36:46.709 --> 04:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
wanting or Reckless conduct but under
 
04:36:48.189 --> 04:36:48.199 align:start position:0%
this bill we would no longer have the
 
04:36:50.789 --> 04:36:50.799 align:start position:0%
ability to um decline representation of
 
04:36:52.910 --> 04:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
those individuals in that
 
04:36:55.470 --> 04:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
circumstance um the bill also would
 
04:36:59.189 --> 04:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
bypass um the board of claims which is
 
04:37:01.590 --> 04:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
currently a helpful tool for resolving
 
04:37:05.230 --> 04:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
smaller claims everything no matter how
 
04:37:07.429 --> 04:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
minor would go to Superior
 
04:37:09.789 --> 04:37:09.799 align:start position:0%
Court um the bill
 
04:37:12.551 --> 04:37:12.561 align:start position:0%
also allows for claims to be brought by
 
04:37:15.470 --> 04:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
any individual for a violation of a
 
04:37:17.990 --> 04:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
right so I think proxy lawsuits would be
 
04:37:20.510 --> 04:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
permitted under this legislation and
 
04:37:22.510 --> 04:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
that bypasses the usual requirements
 
04:37:24.830 --> 04:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
that an injured individual have standing
 
04:37:26.709 --> 04:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
in some injury in order to be able to
 
04:37:27.789 --> 04:37:27.799 align:start position:0%
bring a
 
04:37:33.189 --> 04:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
lawsuit and um finally the fee shifting
 
04:37:35.910 --> 04:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
provision that uh requires that
 
04:37:37.551 --> 04:37:37.561 align:start position:0%
claimants can recover their attorney
 
04:37:42.070 --> 04:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
fees if they Prevail in any way um would
 
04:37:46.349 --> 04:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
uh I think operate as a disincentive to
 
04:37:48.830 --> 04:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
State Employees and policy makers to
 
04:37:52.070 --> 04:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
make the very changes which this bill is
 
04:37:54.949 --> 04:37:54.959 align:start position:0%
uh attempting to promote so for all of
 
04:37:59.070 --> 04:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
those reasons um we have concerns that
 
04:38:03.510 --> 04:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
this bill um would greatly increase the
 
04:38:05.510 --> 04:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
the volume and the
 
04:38:09.109 --> 04:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
um and the expense of litigation against
 
04:38:11.789 --> 04:38:11.799 align:start position:0%
the state thank you questions for this
 
04:38:13.510 --> 04:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative
 
04:38:17.390 --> 04:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
Smith thank here I am here you are thank
 
04:38:20.949 --> 04:38:20.959 align:start position:0%
you um very much um I'm I'm not going to
 
04:38:23.910 --> 04:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
focus on the fact that you might have to
 
04:38:27.269 --> 04:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
increase the cost or the hours because
 
04:38:28.949 --> 04:38:28.959 align:start position:0%
if if there's work that you're supposed
 
04:38:30.629 --> 04:38:30.639 align:start position:0%
to do and it's going to take more time
 
04:38:34.510 --> 04:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
and more hours so be it but what I don't
 
04:38:37.670 --> 04:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
understand at uh was one of your last
 
04:38:41.269 --> 04:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
comments about attorney's the attorney
 
04:38:43.830 --> 04:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
Fe section being a
 
04:38:46.029 --> 04:38:46.039 align:start position:0%
disincentive could you help me
 
04:38:48.029 --> 04:38:48.039 align:start position:0%
understand that yes I'd be happy to
 
04:38:50.349 --> 04:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
thank you so the um the provision
 
04:38:52.390 --> 04:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
provides that if a claimant prevails in
 
04:38:56.470 --> 04:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
any way whether it be through uh a court
 
04:38:58.510 --> 04:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
order but also through settlement or
 
04:39:01.429 --> 04:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
even if the state voluntarily chooses to
 
04:39:03.910 --> 04:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
correct the practice complained of that
 
04:39:05.470 --> 04:39:05.480 align:start position:0%
the claimant is in titled to its
 
04:39:09.070 --> 04:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
attorney fece so if uh if the state
 
04:39:11.269 --> 04:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
currently what our office does is
 
04:39:12.869 --> 04:39:12.879 align:start position:0%
sometimes we will g a lawsuit and we
 
04:39:14.869 --> 04:39:14.879 align:start position:0%
will see that the claiming is correct
 
04:39:16.510 --> 04:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
and we will advise the agency that they
 
04:39:19.269 --> 04:39:19.279 align:start position:0%
need to change their practice um and
 
04:39:20.670 --> 04:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes agencies will do that when
 
04:39:22.390 --> 04:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
something is brought to their attention
 
04:39:25.750 --> 04:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
by a member of the public um this would
 
04:39:28.150 --> 04:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
actually potentially disincentivize them
 
04:39:30.390 --> 04:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
to do that and and put them in a
 
04:39:33.429 --> 04:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
position of wanting to um defend their
 
04:39:38.990 --> 04:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:39.000 --> 04:39:42.868 align:start position:0%
 
costs

04:39:42.868 --> 04:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:47.830 --> 04:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
oh than the explanation I guess I'm slow
 
04:39:49.788 --> 04:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
this afternoon because I don't
 
04:39:53.310 --> 04:39:53.320 align:start position:0%
understand it but I'm I understand that
 
04:39:55.070 --> 04:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
that is your explanation and I'll try to
 
04:39:57.310 --> 04:39:57.320 align:start position:0%
parse that
 
04:40:00.708 --> 04:40:00.718 align:start position:0%
um thank you other questions yes
 
04:40:00.718 --> 04:40:01.948 align:start position:0%
um thank you other questions yes
representative

04:40:01.948 --> 04:40:01.958 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:40:04.470 --> 04:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
gon thank you for taking our questions I
 
04:40:06.310 --> 04:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
I thought I heard you say and I thought
 
04:40:08.750 --> 04:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
I heard it from someone else that you're
 
04:40:11.550 --> 04:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
concerned that the state or the county
 
04:40:14.190 --> 04:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
or whatever level of government is being
 
04:40:16.270 --> 04:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
sued would be responsible for covering
 
04:40:18.910 --> 04:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
the expenses of this employee so is then
 
04:40:21.070 --> 04:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
the solution to that that we go after
 
04:40:22.830 --> 04:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
04:40:26.990 --> 04:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
employee um So currently the way that um
 
04:40:29.430 --> 04:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
the indemnification works is that we do
 
04:40:32.310 --> 04:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
in as long as the employee is not acting
 
04:40:34.868 --> 04:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
in a wanting or Reckless manner we do
 
04:40:37.590 --> 04:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
already uh indemnify the employee
 
04:40:39.510 --> 04:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
against the consequences of any
 
04:40:41.270 --> 04:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
litigation our office defends them
 
04:40:43.628 --> 04:40:43.638 align:start position:0%
that's uh presumed to RSA
 
04:40:47.708 --> 04:40:47.718 align:start position:0%
99d um this would take a away our
 
04:40:50.270 --> 04:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
ability to decline to do that in certain
 
04:40:52.510 --> 04:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
cases where the conduct is particularly
 
04:40:55.310 --> 04:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
egregious and would require us to defend
 
04:40:59.230 --> 04:40:59.240 align:start position:0%
even a very egregious um situation
 
04:41:03.390 --> 04:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:06.070 --> 04:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
y if
 
04:41:12.030 --> 04:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:14.868 --> 04:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
egregious under the jurisdiction of
 
04:41:16.868 --> 04:41:16.878 align:start position:0%
whatever agency or
 
04:41:19.390 --> 04:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
Department why would you not be
 
04:41:21.708 --> 04:41:21.718 align:start position:0%
responsible as that department or Agency
 
04:41:25.110 --> 04:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
for the actions of that employee uh we
 
04:41:28.510 --> 04:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
we decline to defend for example uh in
 
04:41:31.470 --> 04:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
the case where somebody is um is
 
04:41:34.628 --> 04:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
violating the law uh like a committing
 
04:41:35.948 --> 04:41:35.958 align:start position:0%
being a criminal
 
04:41:39.190 --> 04:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
offense utilizing their their access in
 
04:41:42.070 --> 04:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
a through State Employment to commit a
 
04:41:45.230 --> 04:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
crime and the reason we defend that
 
04:41:46.948 --> 04:41:46.958 align:start position:0%
decline that representation and don't
 
04:41:49.708 --> 04:41:49.718 align:start position:0%
defend that case is because that person
 
04:41:54.190 --> 04:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:56.868 --> 04:41:56.878 align:start position:0%
liability other questions for this
 
04:41:59.788 --> 04:41:59.798 align:start position:0%
witness so Mr Ry can I can I just make
 
04:42:02.190 --> 04:42:02.200 align:start position:0%
sure that I'm am I correct in
 
04:42:02.200 --> 04:42:03.550 align:start position:0%
sure that I'm am I correct in
understanding

04:42:03.550 --> 04:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
04:42:03.560 --> 04:42:05.070 align:start position:0%
understanding
that

04:42:05.070 --> 04:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:42:07.430 --> 04:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
to the extent there may be any
 
04:42:10.110 --> 04:42:10.120 align:start position:0%
confusion the qualified immunity that
 
04:42:14.190 --> 04:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
currently exists doesn't mean that a a
 
04:42:18.190 --> 04:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
police officer or anyone else who who
 
04:42:20.590 --> 04:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
engages in Reckless or wanting
 
04:42:24.270 --> 04:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
misconduct is is entitled to immunity it
 
04:42:28.830 --> 04:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
just said it just basically it UPS the
 
04:42:31.510 --> 04:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
standard of culpability before somebody
 
04:42:35.230 --> 04:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
can be held uh can be held liable if
 
04:42:38.470 --> 04:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
they fall within the definition of what
 
04:42:40.948 --> 04:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
of of an immunity provision is that
 
04:42:42.708 --> 04:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
correct you are correct yes so so in
 
04:42:45.270 --> 04:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
other words where where where you or I
 
04:42:47.470 --> 04:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
might be if we were not if we were just
 
04:42:48.868 --> 04:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
sort of in the private sector or
 
04:42:51.270 --> 04:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
whatever while we might be held liable
 
04:42:51.280 --> 04:42:52.628 align:start position:0%
whatever while we might be held liable
for

04:42:52.628 --> 04:42:52.638 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:42:56.150 --> 04:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
negligence a police officer who is who
 
04:42:58.788 --> 04:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
is acting in an official capacity would
 
04:43:01.070 --> 04:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
not be liable for negligence but could
 
04:43:05.788 --> 04:43:05.798 align:start position:0%
be liable if his conduct was Reckless or
 
04:43:09.590 --> 04:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
wanton that's correct generally yes for
 
04:43:11.470 --> 04:43:11.480 align:start position:0%
for state employees across the board not
 
04:43:13.030 --> 04:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
not just police officer but state
 
04:43:14.868 --> 04:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
employees across the board yes so it
 
04:43:17.470 --> 04:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
gives it gives the state employees for
 
04:43:20.110 --> 04:43:20.120 align:start position:0%
lack of a better term it gives them more
 
04:43:22.708 --> 04:43:22.718 align:start position:0%
it gives them more uh more latitude that
 
04:43:25.270 --> 04:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
might be to be to avoid liability that
 
04:43:26.670 --> 04:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
it might be the case if somebody is not
 
04:43:28.310 --> 04:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
a state employee so the doctrine you're
 
04:43:29.670 --> 04:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
describing the qualified immunity
 
04:43:31.590 --> 04:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
Doctrine in federal court provides that
 
04:43:35.230 --> 04:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
protection in in the State uh statutes
 
04:43:37.510 --> 04:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
that is uh some exceptions to the claim
 
04:43:41.230 --> 04:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
statute that are found in uh 541 b19 and
 
04:43:42.990 --> 04:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
they're we also call them discretionary
 
04:43:44.948 --> 04:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
function immunity official immunity and
 
04:43:46.708 --> 04:43:46.718 align:start position:0%

04:43:49.350 --> 04:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
State Employees in State Court thank you
 
04:43:51.430 --> 04:43:51.440 align:start position:0%

04:43:53.270 --> 04:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
right thank you next I'm going to call
 
04:44:03.390 --> 04:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:03.400 --> 04:44:11.110 align:start position:0%
 
please

04:44:11.110 --> 04:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:12.628 --> 04:44:12.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
04:44:14.430 --> 04:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Kate Horan I'm here
 
04:44:15.788 --> 04:44:15.798 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
04:44:17.910 --> 04:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
Association of counties just to remind
 
04:44:19.868 --> 04:44:19.878 align:start position:0%
you that is all 10 counties of your
 
04:44:21.830 --> 04:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
elected and appointed officials here in
 
04:44:24.310 --> 04:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
the state the association is opposed to
 
04:44:26.470 --> 04:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
this bill uh and we will Echo many of
 
04:44:28.910 --> 04:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
the comments from the previous speakers
 
04:44:31.270 --> 04:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
um our main concern is there is no
 
04:44:33.948 --> 04:44:33.958 align:start position:0%
protection for a employee who simply
 
04:44:36.070 --> 04:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
makes a a mistake they believe they are
 
04:44:38.270 --> 04:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
acting within the law but they make a
 
04:44:40.628 --> 04:44:40.638 align:start position:0%
mistake for misunderstanding their
 
04:44:42.990 --> 04:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
training or whatever whatever it is
 
04:44:44.150 --> 04:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to correct that with
 
04:44:50.788 --> 04:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
the employee a citizen could just Sue as
 
04:44:52.990 --> 04:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
they do the other concern that we have
 
04:44:55.948 --> 04:44:55.958 align:start position:0%
is uh to Echo the comments of the
 
04:44:58.270 --> 04:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
speaker from the state employees union
 
04:45:01.868 --> 04:45:01.878 align:start position:0%
uh our County correctional officers and
 
04:45:03.590 --> 04:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
our County nursing homes are
 
04:45:05.910 --> 04:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
experiencing severe Workforce
 
04:45:08.510 --> 04:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
shortages we are losing especially in
 
04:45:10.590 --> 04:45:10.600 align:start position:0%
our nursing homes nurses to Private
 
04:45:12.948 --> 04:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
Industry we are losing our correctional
 
04:45:18.270 --> 04:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
officers to Walmart and uh dunad Donuts
 
04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
who are paying better for quite frankly
 
04:45:23.990 --> 04:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
less strenuous and less dangerous work
 
04:45:25.868 --> 04:45:25.878 align:start position:0%
um so why is someone going to come and
 
04:45:27.430 --> 04:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
work for the county in either one of
 
04:45:29.390 --> 04:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
those situations when this would then
 
04:45:31.788 --> 04:45:31.798 align:start position:0%
also open them up to being fired or
 
04:45:33.510 --> 04:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
additional liability that they could
 
04:45:35.510 --> 04:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
experience when they could be doing
 
04:45:37.990 --> 04:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
something that is less risky in their
 
04:45:39.990 --> 04:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
point whether that's working in Private
 
04:45:42.708 --> 04:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
Industry or working for uh a nursing
 
04:45:44.550 --> 04:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
home that is a private entity and not a
 
04:45:47.270 --> 04:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
County facility uh I will also remind
 
04:45:49.150 --> 04:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
this uh committee that the County
 
04:45:51.350 --> 04:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
nursing homes are the nursing homes of
 
04:45:53.910 --> 04:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
Last Resort we are the safety net that
 
04:45:56.430 --> 04:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
is where someone goes when and you all
 
04:45:58.470 --> 04:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
know this when they are out of money
 
04:46:01.868 --> 04:46:01.878 align:start position:0%
they can no longer afford to be at the
 
04:46:04.550 --> 04:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh at a private facility they are most
 
04:46:06.830 --> 04:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
vulnerable elderly adults and we want to
 
04:46:08.470 --> 04:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are giving them the
 
04:46:10.910 --> 04:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
best uh care that we can possibly give
 
04:46:13.390 --> 04:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
them uh I'm happy to take any questions
 
04:46:13.400 --> 04:46:14.910 align:start position:0%
them uh I'm happy to take any questions
but

04:46:14.910 --> 04:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:46:18.070 --> 04:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
um I will conclude my testimony there
 
04:46:19.390 --> 04:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
right thank you question yes
 
04:46:19.400 --> 04:46:22.868 align:start position:0%
right thank you question yes
representative

04:46:22.868 --> 04:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:26.868 --> 04:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
Smith uh you just said something
 
04:46:30.990 --> 04:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
that caught my attention um having to do
 
04:46:34.788 --> 04:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
with the County nursing homes that you
 
04:46:38.670 --> 04:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
want to do the best that can be done for
 
04:46:40.788 --> 04:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
people who have no other options I'm
 
04:46:43.110 --> 04:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing what you said yes
 
04:46:47.948 --> 04:46:47.958 align:start position:0%
man' now so connect that to the issue of
 
04:46:50.628 --> 04:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
whether people who are taking care of
 
04:46:54.910 --> 04:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
those vulnerable people are to be held
 
04:46:58.750 --> 04:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
accountable for inappropriate actions
 
04:47:00.548 --> 04:47:00.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions and we
 
04:47:02.230 --> 04:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
certainly want to make sure if someone
 
04:47:04.430 --> 04:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
is doing something criminally wrong that
 
04:47:07.390 --> 04:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
they are being prosecuted to the fullest
 
04:47:09.788 --> 04:47:09.798 align:start position:0%
extent of the law um but if someone in
 
04:47:11.470 --> 04:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
the County Nursing Home simply makes a
 
04:47:14.548 --> 04:47:14.558 align:start position:0%
paperwork error they probably shouldn't
 
04:47:17.430 --> 04:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
be at risk of losing their job or being
 
04:47:19.708 --> 04:47:19.718 align:start position:0%
sued for a simple paperwork error and
 
04:47:22.430 --> 04:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
there are no standards within this bill
 
04:47:24.390 --> 04:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
other than uh what the sponsor
 
04:47:27.670 --> 04:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
referenced around use of force listed in
 
04:47:27.680 --> 04:47:29.190 align:start position:0%
referenced around use of force listed in
this

04:47:29.190 --> 04:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:47:32.670 --> 04:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you other questions yes
 
04:47:34.788 --> 04:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
 
04:47:36.230 --> 04:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:47:38.590 --> 04:47:38.600 align:start position:0%
would any if this bill were to pass
 
04:47:40.990 --> 04:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
would any violation of 91a right to
 
04:47:44.430 --> 04:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
privacy be considered an ability to
 
04:47:46.788 --> 04:47:46.798 align:start position:0%
sue thank you for the question yes we do
 
04:47:46.798 --> 04:47:47.750 align:start position:0%
sue thank you for the question yes we do
believe

04:47:47.750 --> 04:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
believe
 
04:47:50.708 --> 04:47:50.718 align:start position:0%
so other questions for this
 
04:47:53.190 --> 04:47:53.200 align:start position:0%

in 2000 active in retired professional
 
04:48:19.470 --> 04:48:19.480 align:start position:0%
firefighters and paramedics across the
 
04:48:21.510 --> 04:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
granite state we advocate for the

04:48:25.310 --> 04:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
and women that protect the citizens of
 
04:48:28.070 --> 04:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
this great state today I'm here in
 
04:48:30.628 --> 04:48:30.638 align:start position:0%
opposition of hb1 1640 due to the
 
04:48:33.350 --> 04:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
potential unintended consequences it may
 
04:48:35.070 --> 04:48:35.080 align:start position:0%
have on fire firefighters and other
 
04:48:39.070 --> 04:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
First Responders throughout the uh
 
04:48:41.270 --> 04:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
Community my members routinely are
 
04:48:42.868 --> 04:48:42.878 align:start position:0%
called upon to make split-second
 
04:48:44.990 --> 04:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
decisions in dangerous life-threatening
 
04:48:47.708 --> 04:48:47.718 align:start position:0%
situations without qualified immunity
 
04:48:49.670 --> 04:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
this can cause hesitation to act in the
 
04:48:52.590 --> 04:48:52.600 align:start position:0%
best interest of the public due to fear
 
04:48:55.270 --> 04:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
of legal repercussions firefighters are
 
04:48:58.030 --> 04:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
often trained to take appropriate action
 
04:48:59.830 --> 04:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
based on their professional judgment
 
04:49:01.708 --> 04:49:01.718 align:start position:0%
without qualified immunity these
 
04:49:04.110 --> 04:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
individuals may have been may be held
 
04:49:06.270 --> 04:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
liable even though they acted in good
 
04:49:08.670 --> 04:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
faith and within their training this
 
04:49:10.670 --> 04:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
bill would also greatly increase the
 
04:49:12.548 --> 04:49:12.558 align:start position:0%
liability of government employers and
 
04:49:14.670 --> 04:49:14.680 align:start position:0%
expose them to a significant amount of
 
04:49:17.030 --> 04:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
legal action and financial burden this
 
04:49:18.510 --> 04:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
would be a negative impact on the
 
04:49:20.830 --> 04:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
ability of government employers to
 
04:49:22.830 --> 04:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
effectively serve their communities and
 
04:49:26.270 --> 04:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
fulfill their responsibilities in those
 
04:49:29.548 --> 04:49:29.558 align:start position:0%
in those um related emergency responses
 
04:49:33.030 --> 04:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
I urge the committee to consider a to
 
04:49:35.708 --> 04:49:35.718 align:start position:0%
consider other options as any act to
 
04:49:38.350 --> 04:49:38.360 align:start position:0%
limit or eliminate any sort of qualified
 
04:49:41.110 --> 04:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
immunity is an immediate red flag with
 
04:49:43.470 --> 04:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
the fear of when you start chiseling
 
04:49:45.830 --> 04:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
away at things like qualified immunity
 
04:49:47.990 --> 04:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
eventually they will be all gone with
 
04:49:50.230 --> 04:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
that I will wrap it up there uh our
 
04:49:52.190 --> 04:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
president Brian reel has submitted
 
04:49:54.110 --> 04:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
written testimony for you all if you
 
04:49:55.430 --> 04:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
have any questions I'm more than happy
 
04:49:58.948 --> 04:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
to answer questions for this witness
 
04:50:00.788 --> 04:50:00.798 align:start position:0%
representative foress thank you thanks
 
04:50:02.190 --> 04:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
for taking
 
04:50:04.390 --> 04:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
so you're saying
 
04:50:07.230 --> 04:50:07.240 align:start position:0%
did you say that if we eliminated
 
04:50:09.310 --> 04:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity a firefighter or a
 
04:50:11.548 --> 04:50:11.558 align:start position:0%
police officer instead of doing what
 
04:50:13.830 --> 04:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
they were trained to do and would do
 
04:50:16.708 --> 04:50:16.718 align:start position:0%
automatically might stop and say maybe I
 
04:50:18.708 --> 04:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
shouldn't because I don't have qualified
 
04:50:20.868 --> 04:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
immunity I don't believe that could ever
 
04:50:23.270 --> 04:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
happen I don't believe the firefighters
 
04:50:25.990 --> 04:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
and the police officers I know hesitate
 
04:50:29.270 --> 04:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
at all and think about the consequences
 
04:50:30.708 --> 04:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
so you're saying you think they would
 
04:50:32.430 --> 04:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
think about not having qualified
 
04:50:34.788 --> 04:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
immunity if the qualified immunity
 
04:50:37.070 --> 04:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't there this could cause a
 
04:50:39.708 --> 04:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
situation where a firefighter or a
 
04:50:41.470 --> 04:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
paramedic or anybody in that line of
 
04:50:44.470 --> 04:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
work could pause to hesitate in in an
 
04:50:46.990 --> 04:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
industry where you don't have time to
 
04:50:48.670 --> 04:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
think you need to act based on your
 
04:50:50.868 --> 04:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
training uh that could be that could be
 
04:50:50.878 --> 04:50:52.350 align:start position:0%
training uh that could be that could be
very

04:50:52.350 --> 04:50:52.360 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:50:54.470 --> 04:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
important other questions for this
 
04:50:57.190 --> 04:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
witness representative
 
04:51:01.708 --> 04:51:01.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:04.670 --> 04:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
question the the the the term that's
 
04:51:07.990 --> 04:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
used here is qualified immunity so first
 
04:51:10.190 --> 04:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know what is meant by
 
04:51:12.110 --> 04:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity so what is the
 
04:51:14.628 --> 04:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
qualifications for it and then it would
 
04:51:17.470 --> 04:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
appear to me that this bill is only
 
04:51:20.470 --> 04:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
addressing or or seeks to address where
 
04:51:25.510 --> 04:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
there is clearly some violation of those
 
04:51:28.670 --> 04:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
qualifiers and how to best handle those
 
04:51:31.750 --> 04:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
violations of those qualifiers so a
 
04:51:34.430 --> 04:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
firefighter acting as according to the
 
04:51:36.350 --> 04:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
training doesn't seem like it's a
 
04:51:38.030 --> 04:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
violation of any of the
 
04:51:41.830 --> 04:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
qualifiers so how do we how do we
 
04:51:41.840 --> 04:51:43.868 align:start position:0%
qualifiers so how do we how do we
protect

04:51:43.868 --> 04:51:43.878 align:start position:0%
protect
 
04:51:49.430 --> 04:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
the the firefighter from any kind of
 
04:51:52.070 --> 04:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
Retribution when performing his or her
 
04:51:54.910 --> 04:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
duties according to training from the
 
04:51:58.548 --> 04:51:58.558 align:start position:0%
one who does whatever wantedly or
 
04:52:00.910 --> 04:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
whatever how do we balance that and if
 
04:52:02.390 --> 04:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's if that's not what this bill is
 
04:52:04.670 --> 04:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
actually doing then how do we go about
 
04:52:07.110 --> 04:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
doing that of course representative
 
04:52:09.470 --> 04:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I to your
 
04:52:11.590 --> 04:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
point I would say for the qualified it
 
04:52:13.350 --> 04:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
would be by these standards in training
 
04:52:15.788 --> 04:52:15.798 align:start position:0%
of what they are able to do as for a
 
04:52:17.910 --> 04:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
solution off the top of my head I'm not
 
04:52:19.910 --> 04:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
prepared at this moment I'd be happy to
 
04:52:21.830 --> 04:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh provide you with some more
 
04:52:25.150 --> 04:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
information other questions for this
 
04:52:28.110 --> 04:52:28.120 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you sir thank

good afternoon chairman Lyn and members
 
04:52:55.548 --> 04:52:55.558 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is alen
 
04:52:56.910 --> 04:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
aldenberg and I'm the chief of police of
 
04:52:58.590 --> 04:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
the Manchester police department and
 
04:52:59.788 --> 04:52:59.798 align:start position:0%
currently the president of the New
 
04:53:02.270 --> 04:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of chiefs police
 
04:53:04.310 --> 04:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
I'm here today today to testify in
 
04:53:05.910 --> 04:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill
 
04:53:08.230 --> 04:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
1640 the Hampshire Department of Justice
 
04:53:10.190 --> 04:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire Association of counties
 
04:53:12.150 --> 04:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
and Hampshire Municipal Association or
 
04:53:14.350 --> 04:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
all agreement 1640 would result in a
 
04:53:16.788 --> 04:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
significant increase in litigation for
 
04:53:18.590 --> 04:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
state and local New Hampshire government
 
04:53:21.350 --> 04:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
entities I am in complete agreement with
 
04:53:23.070 --> 04:53:23.080 align:start position:0%
that assessment and as a citizen of the
 
04:53:24.830 --> 04:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
state I have grave concerns about the
 
04:53:26.948 --> 04:53:26.958 align:start position:0%
ability of local governments to operate
 
04:53:29.150 --> 04:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
under such a barrage of civil litigation
 
04:53:31.310 --> 04:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
I will however leave that critique for
 
04:53:33.150 --> 04:53:33.160 align:start position:0%
the organizations to articulate that
 
04:53:33.160 --> 04:53:34.230 align:start position:0%
the organizations to articulate that
further

04:53:34.230 --> 04:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:53:36.510 --> 04:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
my expertise and why I'm here today is
 
04:53:38.390 --> 04:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
to share insights on the direct impact
 
04:53:41.548 --> 04:53:41.558 align:start position:0%
of HP 1640 and what it will have on La
 
04:53:43.270 --> 04:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers and consequently
 
04:53:44.948 --> 04:53:44.958 align:start position:0%
the safety of New Hampshire
 
04:53:46.830 --> 04:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
Citizens First I want to express
 
04:53:48.830 --> 04:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
appreciation for the Bill's objectives
 
04:53:50.470 --> 04:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
accountability within government is
 
04:53:52.788 --> 04:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
crucial and nowhere is it more vital
 
04:53:54.548 --> 04:53:54.558 align:start position:0%
than in law enforcement and in Public
 
04:53:56.910 --> 04:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
Safety in recent years New Hampshire law
 
04:53:58.590 --> 04:53:58.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement has made significant strides
 
04:54:01.590 --> 04:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
in this area we have widely adopted body
 
04:54:03.190 --> 04:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
cameras and significantly increased
 
04:54:05.628 --> 04:54:05.638 align:start position:0%
annual training requirements Statewide a
 
04:54:07.670 --> 04:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
conduct Review Committee staffed by law
 
04:54:10.350 --> 04:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers and civilians which
 
04:54:11.910 --> 04:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
now oversees complaints of Officer
 
04:54:14.590 --> 04:54:14.600 align:start position:0%
misconduct at the state level and
 
04:54:16.390 --> 04:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
Statewide standardization of internal
 
04:54:18.948 --> 04:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
investigation procedures is underway
 
04:54:20.910 --> 04:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
these represent major structural changes
 
04:54:22.830 --> 04:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire law enforcement has
 
04:54:24.948 --> 04:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
willingly and enthusiastically
 
04:54:27.030 --> 04:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
undertaken I point out these efforts to
 
04:54:28.590 --> 04:54:28.600 align:start position:0%
illustrate New Hampshire law enforcement
 
04:54:30.868 --> 04:54:30.878 align:start position:0%
and is no way an obstructionist or
 
04:54:32.510 --> 04:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
hesitant to implement accountability
 
04:54:34.230 --> 04:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
measures the New Hampshire law
 
04:54:36.030 --> 04:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement Community will always be a
 
04:54:38.110 --> 04:54:38.120 align:start position:0%
partner in any proposals to increase
 
04:54:39.868 --> 04:54:39.878 align:start position:0%
accountability while allowing our
 
04:54:42.230 --> 04:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
officers to do their jobs effectively
 
04:54:43.750 --> 04:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the unintended
 
04:54:45.948 --> 04:54:45.958 align:start position:0%
consequences of that will manifest if
 
04:54:48.590 --> 04:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
house bills 1640 becomes law are
 
04:54:50.670 --> 04:54:50.680 align:start position:0%
impossible to ignore and I have a
 
04:54:52.190 --> 04:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility to articulate those
 
04:54:55.390 --> 04:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
concerns today as you know 1640 will
 
04:54:56.910 --> 04:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
essentially nullify almost all
 
04:54:59.110 --> 04:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
government immunity while transferring
 
04:55:00.670 --> 04:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
the financial liability from the
 
04:55:03.990 --> 04:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
employee to the state as you know 1640
 
04:55:06.110 --> 04:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
will essentially nullify almost all
 
04:55:08.590 --> 04:55:08.600 align:start position:0%
government immunity in our state with ex
 
04:55:10.830 --> 04:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
with notable exceptions for legislators
 
04:55:13.270 --> 04:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
and members of the of the Judiciary
 
04:55:14.750 --> 04:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
which I find
 
04:55:16.830 --> 04:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
interesting the government immunity I
 
04:55:18.830 --> 04:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
refer to is commonly known as qualified
 
04:55:21.230 --> 04:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
or official immunity simply put it
 
04:55:22.910 --> 04:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
Shields government employees who make
 
04:55:24.430 --> 04:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
good faith mistakes while operating
 
04:55:25.910 --> 04:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
within the scope of their professional
 
04:55:28.868 --> 04:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
duties from civil litigation it does not
 
04:55:30.788 --> 04:55:30.798 align:start position:0%
and I emphasize a point that we made
 
04:55:32.430 --> 04:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
earlier it does not protect government
 
04:55:34.708 --> 04:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
employees who know ly violate a person
 
04:55:36.830 --> 04:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
whose constitutional rights as some
 
04:55:38.510 --> 04:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
proponents of eliminating qualified
 
04:55:41.510 --> 04:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
immunity seem to suggest my specific
 
04:55:43.910 --> 04:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
concerns surround two likely all but
 
04:55:43.920 --> 04:55:45.230 align:start position:0%
concerns surround two likely all but
unintended

04:55:45.230 --> 04:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
unintended
 
04:55:47.868 --> 04:55:47.878 align:start position:0%
consequences the first is that 1640 will
 
04:55:49.670 --> 04:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
effectively fundamentally affect our
 
04:55:51.230 --> 04:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
officers willingness to engage with the
 
04:55:54.628 --> 04:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
public in ways that we need them to 1640
 
04:55:56.590 --> 04:55:56.600 align:start position:0%
transfers litigation liability from
 
04:55:59.230 --> 04:55:59.240 align:start position:0%
Individual to the state however officers
 
04:56:00.868 --> 04:56:00.878 align:start position:0%
will likely still be drawn into legal
 
04:56:02.750 --> 04:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
proceedings potentially as a third party
 
04:56:02.760 --> 04:56:04.150 align:start position:0%
proceedings potentially as a third party
intervenor

04:56:04.150 --> 04:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
intervenor
 
04:56:05.990 --> 04:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
which could become financially demanding
 
04:56:07.110 --> 04:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
on the
 
04:56:09.670 --> 04:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
employee the burden of ongoing civil
 
04:56:11.510 --> 04:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
litigation and risk of incurring legal
 
04:56:13.948 --> 04:56:13.958 align:start position:0%
expenses May deter our officers from
 
04:56:16.910 --> 04:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
acting decisively when necessary this is
 
04:56:18.708 --> 04:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
extremely concerning as New Hampshire's
 
04:56:20.670 --> 04:56:20.680 align:start position:0%
reputation is one of the nation's first
 
04:56:23.110 --> 04:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
States safest states is probably due to
 
04:56:24.430 --> 04:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
our proactive and engaged Law
 
04:56:26.990 --> 04:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers the bill risk
 
04:56:28.990 --> 04:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
creating a climate of excessive caution
 
04:56:31.110 --> 04:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
that would impede Swift decision-making
 
04:56:32.830 --> 04:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
diminishing our ability to combat crime
 
04:56:32.840 --> 04:56:34.030 align:start position:0%
diminishing our ability to combat crime
effectively

04:56:34.030 --> 04:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
04:56:36.070 --> 04:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
the systematic hesitancy will only serve
 
04:56:37.708 --> 04:56:37.718 align:start position:0%
to embolden criminal activities
 
04:56:39.868 --> 04:56:39.878 align:start position:0%
undermining the high standards of Public
 
04:56:41.830 --> 04:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
Safety we strive to maintain in our
 
04:56:44.910 --> 04:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
state while this analysis is my opinion
 
04:56:46.670 --> 04:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
it's based on more than two decades of
 
04:56:48.868 --> 04:56:48.878 align:start position:0%
law enforcement experience there is also
 
04:56:51.110 --> 04:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
scarly named for this phenomenon called
 
04:56:53.548 --> 04:56:53.558 align:start position:0%
D policing de policing has been
 
04:56:55.230 --> 04:56:55.240 align:start position:0%
extensively documented and studied in
 
04:56:58.150 --> 04:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
recent years it is defined as an I quote
 
04:56:59.788 --> 04:56:59.798 align:start position:0%
the normative decline in proactive
 
04:57:01.670 --> 04:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
police practices due to negative
 
04:57:03.788 --> 04:57:03.798 align:start position:0%
external sources and is believed to
 
04:57:06.470 --> 04:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
constrain proactive police activities
 
04:57:08.830 --> 04:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
the phenomenon of deep policing is often
 
04:57:10.590 --> 04:57:10.600 align:start position:0%
shown to correlate with an increase in
 
04:57:12.510 --> 04:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
violent crime in areas where it is
 
04:57:14.788 --> 04:57:14.798 align:start position:0%
studied I point this out to note that my
 
04:57:16.470 --> 04:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
inclusions are not only based on my own
 
04:57:18.670 --> 04:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
experience but also on recent studies of
 
04:57:20.910 --> 04:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
US law enforcement behavior in reaction
 
04:57:23.470 --> 04:57:23.480 align:start position:0%
to external factors the second
 
04:57:25.230 --> 04:57:25.240 align:start position:0%
consequence of 1640 will be a
 
04:57:27.708 --> 04:57:27.718 align:start position:0%
degradation of ARS morale leading to
 
04:57:29.868 --> 04:57:29.878 align:start position:0%
issues with retention and recruitment
 
04:57:31.590 --> 04:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
which are already at critical levels
 
04:57:33.830 --> 04:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
locally and Nationwide
 
04:57:36.190 --> 04:57:36.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire officers being mirrored in
 
04:57:38.670 --> 04:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
ongoing civil civil litigation they had
 
04:57:40.390 --> 04:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
previously been insulated from will
 
04:57:42.948 --> 04:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
exasperate this issue we cannot expect
 
04:57:44.548 --> 04:57:44.558 align:start position:0%
our police officers and future
 
04:57:46.788 --> 04:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
applicants to ignore a significant
 
04:57:48.910 --> 04:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
change in circumstance such as this when
 
04:57:51.548 --> 04:57:51.558 align:start position:0%
making employment decisions even with
 
04:57:53.470 --> 04:57:53.480 align:start position:0%
protection from Financial liability in
 
04:57:55.510 --> 04:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
these cases the ongoing threat of
 
04:57:57.150 --> 04:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
litigation and the potential for
 
04:57:58.910 --> 04:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
officers to pay their own representation
 
04:58:01.030 --> 04:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
at some point will have a negative
 
04:58:03.350 --> 04:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
effect neither the concerns preious
 
04:58:05.230 --> 04:58:05.240 align:start position:0%
outline should be interpret interpreted
 
04:58:06.548 --> 04:58:06.558 align:start position:0%
to suggest that New Hampshire Law
 
04:58:08.310 --> 04:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers should never be
 
04:58:11.350 --> 04:58:11.360 align:start position:0%
subject to lawsuits or infallible my
 
04:58:12.830 --> 04:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
argument is that current standard of
 
04:58:14.948 --> 04:58:14.958 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity that police officers
 
04:58:17.310 --> 04:58:17.320 align:start position:0%
have in our state is an integral part of
 
04:58:19.788 --> 04:58:19.798 align:start position:0%
our delicate legislative and judicial
 
04:58:22.030 --> 04:58:22.040 align:start position:0%
ecosystem that allows officers to do
 
04:58:24.948 --> 04:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
their job 1640 would abruptly strip
 
04:58:26.708 --> 04:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
these protections and risk creating
 
04:58:28.830 --> 04:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
environment where law enforcement in New
 
04:58:30.830 --> 04:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is apprehensive and unable to
 
04:58:32.628 --> 04:58:32.638 align:start position:0%
address crime effectively to ensure
 
04:58:35.110 --> 04:58:35.120 align:start position:0%
public saf safety which our all of our
 
04:58:37.910 --> 04:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
citizens have become accustomed to the
 
04:58:39.670 --> 04:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
following quote from the 2007 New
 
04:58:41.430 --> 04:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court decision in ever
 
04:58:44.548 --> 04:58:44.558 align:start position:0%
vers GE company summarizes the need for
 
04:58:46.310 --> 04:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers to be insulated
 
04:58:49.230 --> 04:58:49.240 align:start position:0%
from constant civil claims the public
 
04:58:51.670 --> 04:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
simply cannot afford for those
 
04:58:53.390 --> 04:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
individuals charged with securing and
 
04:58:55.548 --> 04:58:55.558 align:start position:0%
preserving Community safety to have
 
04:58:57.350 --> 04:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
their judgment shaded out of fear of
 
04:58:59.430 --> 04:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
subsequent lawsuits or to have their
 
04:59:01.230 --> 04:59:01.240 align:start position:0%
energies otherwise deflected by
 
04:59:04.390 --> 04:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
litigation at a time at times lengthy
 
04:59:06.430 --> 04:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
encumbersome so I strongly encourage you
 
04:59:09.470 --> 04:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
to find 1640 inexpedient inexpedient in
 
04:59:10.670 --> 04:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
legislate and I'm happy to take any
 
04:59:12.628 --> 04:59:12.638 align:start position:0%
questions that this committee has thank
 
04:59:14.628 --> 04:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman questions for this
 
04:59:16.510 --> 04:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
witness uh representative Alexander then

and thank you chief for taking my
 
04:59:22.350 --> 04:59:22.360 align:start position:0%
question um I know specifically in gtown
 
04:59:24.628 --> 04:59:24.638 align:start position:0%
we're currently down five five patrolman
 
04:59:26.510 --> 04:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
positions through retention issues can
 
04:59:28.270 --> 04:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
you talk to me a little bit about how
 
04:59:30.750 --> 04:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester is working on their like do
 
04:59:32.150 --> 04:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
they have retention issues similar to
 
04:59:33.910 --> 04:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
gown you I have an authorization that's
 
04:59:35.150 --> 04:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
a great question representative I have
 
04:59:37.788 --> 04:59:37.798 align:start position:0%
an authorization of 272 police officers
 
04:59:40.310 --> 04:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
from top to bottom as of this morning I
 
04:59:42.910 --> 04:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
have 23 vacancies um what you are
 
04:59:44.670 --> 04:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
finding with the applicants and good for
 
04:59:48.310 --> 04:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
them um they they pay paying attention
 
04:59:50.670 --> 04:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
more to these things perhaps 25 years
 
04:59:52.948 --> 04:59:52.958 align:start position:0%
ago when I became a police officer um
 
04:59:55.310 --> 04:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
they're asking these questions and I'll
 
04:59:57.750 --> 04:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
take it a step further with my current
 
05:00:00.430 --> 05:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
officers and employees that I have
 
05:00:01.868 --> 05:00:01.878 align:start position:0%
they're paying attention to this and
 
05:00:04.390 --> 05:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
they are saying to themselves
 
05:00:06.990 --> 05:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
what more can we do as law
 
05:00:09.270 --> 05:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement we're this is sense that
 
05:00:11.150 --> 05:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
we're there constantly under attack
 
05:00:13.230 --> 05:00:13.240 align:start position:0%
we've agreed to reform the governor's
 
05:00:15.470 --> 05:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
leak commission body cameras all these
 
05:00:16.510 --> 05:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
things that I mentioned that law
 
05:00:17.750 --> 05:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement has
 
05:00:19.990 --> 05:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
embraced and they're Al starting to say
 
05:00:23.310 --> 05:00:23.320 align:start position:0%
to themselves is this really worth it is
 
05:00:25.628 --> 05:00:25.638 align:start position:0%
this risk putting my family at further
 
05:00:27.708 --> 05:00:27.718 align:start position:0%
risk and harm for me simply going out
 
05:00:31.548 --> 05:00:31.558 align:start position:0%
and doing my job lawfully and again if I
 
05:00:33.628 --> 05:00:33.638 align:start position:0%
could represented and you asked the
 
05:00:37.310 --> 05:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
question earlier about to the sponsor of
 
05:00:39.350 --> 05:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
this bill what could have been done
 
05:00:41.510 --> 05:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
differently what could have been done
 
05:00:43.830 --> 05:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
and perhaps it was I'm not certain but
 
05:00:45.670 --> 05:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
we have a public Integrity unit in this
 
05:00:48.590 --> 05:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
state that this body put into place we
 
05:00:50.470 --> 05:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
have a conduct Review Committee that
 
05:00:52.350 --> 05:00:52.360 align:start position:0%
this body put into place those are
 
05:00:54.110 --> 05:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
avenues that a citizen feels if they
 
05:00:56.510 --> 05:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
were wronged they can pursue those
 
05:00:59.270 --> 05:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
Avenues to determine if an officer acted
 
05:01:01.910 --> 05:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
inappropriately or engaged in misconduct
 
05:01:04.590 --> 05:01:04.600 align:start position:0%
so again law enforcement has embraced
 
05:01:07.230 --> 05:01:07.240 align:start position:0%
those things so there are things in
 
05:01:12.510 --> 05:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
place for people to pursue a perceived
 
05:01:15.470 --> 05:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
wrong yeah um representa gon you had a
 
05:01:16.868 --> 05:01:16.878 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you and thank you
 
05:01:18.310 --> 05:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
chief for your for your
 
05:01:22.150 --> 05:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
testimony you said that immunity is for
 
05:01:24.910 --> 05:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
good faith mistakes not violations of
 
05:01:28.350 --> 05:01:28.360 align:start position:0%
civil rights and as I read through here
 
05:01:32.990 --> 05:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
I'm only finding where this deals with a
 
05:01:36.750 --> 05:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
violation of someone's constitutional
 
05:01:40.310 --> 05:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
rights so it's not about the paperwork
 
05:01:42.948 --> 05:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
mistake it's about a violation of civil
 
05:01:45.190 --> 05:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
rights and then the plaintiff Bears the
 
05:01:46.670 --> 05:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
burden of
 
05:01:49.190 --> 05:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
proving that the government employee
 
05:01:50.510 --> 05:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
violated a
 
05:01:53.030 --> 05:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
right so how
 
05:01:56.948 --> 05:01:56.958 align:start position:0%
does how does this in holding that
 
05:01:59.470 --> 05:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
person and then and then the the
 
05:02:02.910 --> 05:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
government agency has the ability to not
 
05:02:05.750 --> 05:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
defend that employee if they believe
 
05:02:07.230 --> 05:02:07.240 align:start position:0%
that they did violate the right so so
 
05:02:09.788 --> 05:02:09.798 align:start position:0%
you can still get out of defending them
 
05:02:11.868 --> 05:02:11.878 align:start position:0%
how does this strip away a law
 
05:02:15.590 --> 05:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer's ability to enforce
 
05:02:17.830 --> 05:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
the law and not be subject to because
 
05:02:19.708 --> 05:02:19.718 align:start position:0%
look I get it everybody who's arrested
 
05:02:22.030 --> 05:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
is going to claim you violated my rights
 
05:02:25.868 --> 05:02:25.878 align:start position:0%
right I I I get it but how is this
 
05:02:26.990 --> 05:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
actually going to do that when the
 
05:02:29.190 --> 05:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
plaintiff Bears the burden and you can
 
05:02:31.750 --> 05:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
still get out of paying for their
 
05:02:34.270 --> 05:02:34.280 align:start position:0%
defense well you you're talking still
 
05:02:36.030 --> 05:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some type of civil
 
05:02:39.070 --> 05:02:39.080 align:start position:0%
lawsuit correct somebody's going to
 
05:02:40.548 --> 05:02:40.558 align:start position:0%
allege that their constitutional rights
 
05:02:40.558 --> 05:02:41.990 align:start position:0%
allege that their constitutional rights
are

05:02:41.990 --> 05:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:02:45.830 --> 05:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
violated the somebody can claim that but
 
05:02:47.350 --> 05:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
you they can do that now they can do
 
05:02:49.310 --> 05:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
that now and and the judge can grant a
 
05:02:51.030 --> 05:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
motion to dismiss they can sanction the
 
05:02:53.990 --> 05:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
attorney who files a a a a frivolous
 
05:02:55.868 --> 05:02:55.878 align:start position:0%
case or you know a case to harass a
 
05:02:57.510 --> 05:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
defendant so there's all kinds of
 
05:02:59.190 --> 05:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
Protections in here already and it's
 
05:03:01.590 --> 05:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
only addressing civil rights or
 
05:03:03.510 --> 05:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights not paperwork
 
05:03:05.750 --> 05:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
administrative errors so I'm not really
 
05:03:08.868 --> 05:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
exactly sure how how this affects the
 
05:03:10.310 --> 05:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer from performing
 
05:03:12.990 --> 05:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
their their duties in the same way that
 
05:03:14.708 --> 05:03:14.718 align:start position:0%
they've always done it in good
 
05:03:17.150 --> 05:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
faith even what we're training to do now
 
05:03:19.830 --> 05:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
sir right I I think our officers deserve
 
05:03:21.190 --> 05:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
this level of protection that they
 
05:03:23.868 --> 05:03:23.878 align:start position:0%
currently have because I'm concerned how
 
05:03:25.070 --> 05:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
is that I'm asking you how is this
 
05:03:26.750 --> 05:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
stripping that away I'm not seeing where
 
05:03:29.190 --> 05:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
that strips that away in my my
 
05:03:31.310 --> 05:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
interpretation it strips it away in the
 
05:03:32.670 --> 05:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
sense of that we're going to open our
 
05:03:35.030 --> 05:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
ourselves to additional civil litigation
 
05:03:38.110 --> 05:03:38.120 align:start position:0%
that's my opinion of it and that's and I
 
05:03:40.350 --> 05:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
and I take it to the street cop all
 
05:03:42.948 --> 05:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
right that is responding to your home
 
05:03:45.270 --> 05:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
for something in in progress serious in
 
05:03:47.590 --> 05:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
nature and in the back of their minds I
 
05:03:49.590 --> 05:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
can tell you because I I talk to these
 
05:03:51.990 --> 05:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
men and women every day um and so not
 
05:03:56.190 --> 05:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
the people behind me that hey chief if
 
05:03:59.030 --> 05:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
you know what if what if I did what I'm
 
05:04:01.590 --> 05:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
trained to do and although it was
 
05:04:04.070 --> 05:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate I run the risk of still
 
05:04:05.750 --> 05:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
being dragged through some type of civil
 
05:04:08.190 --> 05:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
litigation even though so if that was
 
05:04:11.470 --> 05:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
your son or daughter right can you see
 
05:04:13.070 --> 05:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
how that fear can be real for a police
 
05:04:15.350 --> 05:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
officer that hey I did my job I did what
 
05:04:17.948 --> 05:04:17.958 align:start position:0%
I was trained to do but I'm I'm still
 
05:04:20.830 --> 05:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
being open to civil litigation above and
 
05:04:22.230 --> 05:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
beyond everything else that law
 
05:04:25.270 --> 05:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement has agreed to put into place
 
05:04:27.628 --> 05:04:27.638 align:start position:0%
to be more transparent to do more
 
05:04:31.470 --> 05:04:31.480 align:start position:0%
training to be better in the community
 
05:04:33.190 --> 05:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
we're doing we're doing a lot of things
 
05:04:35.430 --> 05:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis to make law enforcement
 
05:04:36.788 --> 05:04:36.798 align:start position:0%
better I just think this is going to
 
05:04:39.190 --> 05:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
take us a step backwards that's my
 
05:04:42.590 --> 05:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
opinion other questions for this
 
05:04:44.788 --> 05:04:44.798 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
05:04:46.150 --> 05:04:46.160 align:start position:0%

05:04:47.788 --> 05:04:47.798 align:start position:0%
members of the committee now I'm going
 
05:04:57.948 --> 05:04:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:59.910 --> 05:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
please all right good afternoon Mr
 
05:05:02.030 --> 05:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh members of the committee
 
05:05:03.990 --> 05:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
my name is Frank Campo I'm a sergeant
 
05:05:05.270 --> 05:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
with the state police and I also serve
 
05:05:06.470 --> 05:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
as a president of the Troopers
 
05:05:08.670 --> 05:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
Association um and on behalf of my
 
05:05:09.990 --> 05:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
members I'm here to convey our
 
05:05:12.670 --> 05:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB uh
 
05:05:14.910 --> 05:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
1640 police and other per public
 
05:05:16.788 --> 05:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
servants need qualified immunity to
 
05:05:18.830 --> 05:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
carry out their jobs uh police officers
 
05:05:21.030 --> 05:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
perform vital tasks that often require
 
05:05:22.750 --> 05:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
decision-making under stressful
 
05:05:24.910 --> 05:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances taking qualified immunity
 
05:05:26.788 --> 05:05:26.798 align:start position:0%
away could lead to police officers being
 
05:05:29.510 --> 05:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
hesitant to act when action is needed
 
05:05:31.868 --> 05:05:31.878 align:start position:0%
most removing qualified immunity could
 
05:05:33.548 --> 05:05:33.558 align:start position:0%
also open police lease up to unwarranted
 
05:05:36.230 --> 05:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
lawsuits in which jur juries or judges
 
05:05:38.230 --> 05:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
could second guess these uh decisions
 
05:05:40.110 --> 05:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
that lead to that could potentially lead
 
05:05:42.470 --> 05:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
to significant cost for cities uh the
 
05:05:44.390 --> 05:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
police officers themselves as well as
 
05:05:44.400 --> 05:05:45.070 align:start position:0%
police officers themselves as well as
the

05:05:45.070 --> 05:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:05:47.430 --> 05:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
state like everybody else police
 
05:05:50.190 --> 05:05:50.200 align:start position:0%
officers uh make mistakes uh they must
 
05:05:51.788 --> 05:05:51.798 align:start position:0%
be allowed some room to make those
 
05:05:54.350 --> 05:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
mistakes without worrying about being
 
05:05:56.590 --> 05:05:56.600 align:start position:0%
sued uh I believe the argument for this
 
05:05:58.430 --> 05:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
bill is to hold public servants
 
05:06:00.670 --> 05:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
accountable uh for their actions and I
 
05:06:02.030 --> 05:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
understand the need for this uh the
 
05:06:03.830 --> 05:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
Troopers Association is always happy to
 
05:06:06.510 --> 05:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
see work done to improve law enforcement
 
05:06:08.830 --> 05:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
uh the Lea commission was established
 
05:06:10.590 --> 05:06:10.600 align:start position:0%
and made specific recommendations to
 
05:06:12.628 --> 05:06:12.638 align:start position:0%
improve law enforcement in our state uh
 
05:06:14.830 --> 05:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
the Troopers Association was happy the
 
05:06:16.590 --> 05:06:16.600 align:start position:0%
commission EST uh was established and
 
05:06:17.948 --> 05:06:17.958 align:start position:0%
agreed with the recommendations that
 
05:06:21.708 --> 05:06:21.718 align:start position:0%
they made um but not included in the Lea
 
05:06:23.548 --> 05:06:23.558 align:start position:0%
commission's findings was the need to
 
05:06:27.350 --> 05:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
end qualified immunity so as I finish my
 
05:06:28.470 --> 05:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
testimony here I would just like to
 
05:06:29.750 --> 05:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank the committee for allowing me time
 
05:06:31.548 --> 05:06:31.558 align:start position:0%
to speak and I'd be happy to answer
 
05:06:33.830 --> 05:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
questions if there all right questions
 
05:06:36.470 --> 05:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
for this witness representative gon and
 
05:06:38.150 --> 05:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you
 
05:06:41.350 --> 05:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
said one of your concerns is that the uh
 
05:06:43.350 --> 05:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
the employee such as the law enforcement
 
05:06:47.150 --> 05:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
officer would uh then feel the pressure
 
05:06:49.830 --> 05:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
of the the obligation for under civil
 
05:06:52.190 --> 05:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
action right they they individually but
 
05:06:53.990 --> 05:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
this bill says that the government shall
 
05:06:55.628 --> 05:06:55.638 align:start position:0%
be liable and we heard the concern was
 
05:06:57.990 --> 05:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
that this this cost gets shifted to the
 
05:06:59.708 --> 05:06:59.718 align:start position:0%
government so which is it are we
 
05:07:00.990 --> 05:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
protecting the employee or we going to
 
05:07:02.948 --> 05:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
protect the government
 
05:07:07.868 --> 05:07:07.878 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry um well as far as the um the
 
05:07:09.708 --> 05:07:09.718 align:start position:0%
advice I received from our legal council
 
05:07:11.868 --> 05:07:11.878 align:start position:0%
is um the individual employee would
 
05:07:14.670 --> 05:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
still be uh subject to these um
 
05:07:14.680 --> 05:07:17.430 align:start position:0%
still be uh subject to these um
potential

05:07:17.430 --> 05:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:20.110 --> 05:07:20.120 align:start position:0%

Salem police officer and president of
 
05:07:43.590 --> 05:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Police Association I'm
 
05:07:45.150 --> 05:07:45.160 align:start position:0%
here today to convey the New Hampshire
 
05:07:47.708 --> 05:07:47.718 align:start position:0%
Police Association strong opposition to
 
05:07:48.910 --> 05:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
05:07:51.548 --> 05:07:51.558 align:start position:0%
1640 I know this issue isn't new to you
 
05:07:53.590 --> 05:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
last year this committee overwhelmingly
 
05:07:55.548 --> 05:07:55.558 align:start position:0%
voted to recommend an expedient to
 
05:07:59.150 --> 05:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
legislate by a vote of 16-3 on a similar
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
Bill HB
 
05:08:03.750 --> 05:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
647 nothing has changed over the past
 
05:08:05.830 --> 05:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
year except it has become even more
 
05:08:07.868 --> 05:08:07.878 align:start position:0%
difficult to recruit and retain law
 
05:08:10.788 --> 05:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers in this state and
 
05:08:13.150 --> 05:08:13.160 align:start position:0%
this type of legislation won't help this
 
05:08:15.868 --> 05:08:15.878 align:start position:0%
is exactly the kind of legislation that
 
05:08:18.510 --> 05:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
will Ex exasperate uh serious
 
05:08:20.708 --> 05:08:20.718 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention problems that
 
05:08:22.670 --> 05:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
every local government in the state is
 
05:08:22.680 --> 05:08:23.590 align:start position:0%
every local government in the state is
facing

05:08:23.590 --> 05:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
facing
 
05:08:26.628 --> 05:08:26.638 align:start position:0%
today I believe you you all are aware of
 
05:08:28.910 --> 05:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
the employment challenges we are facing
 
05:08:30.910 --> 05:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
fewer and fewer people are applying for
 
05:08:32.310 --> 05:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
and entering the law enforcement in
 
05:08:34.670 --> 05:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
Korea and a higher percentage of Korea
 
05:08:36.590 --> 05:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
professionals within law enforcement are
 
05:08:39.590 --> 05:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
leaving for a whole host of reasons the
 
05:08:41.670 --> 05:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
feedback from many of these former
 
05:08:43.590 --> 05:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
career professionals have stated they
 
05:08:45.708 --> 05:08:45.718 align:start position:0%
are leaving because of the benefits and
 
05:08:47.990 --> 05:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
the inherent dangers of the job this
 
05:08:49.948 --> 05:08:49.958 align:start position:0%
bill will inflame the
 
05:08:52.350 --> 05:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
situation expanding the ability to sue
 
05:08:54.430 --> 05:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
the state county and local governments
 
05:08:56.868 --> 05:08:56.878 align:start position:0%
for employee actions while on duty has
 
05:08:58.470 --> 05:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
state employees and members of the New
 
05:09:00.990 --> 05:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Police Association extremely
 
05:09:02.830 --> 05:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
concerned about their ability to do
 
05:09:05.510 --> 05:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
their jobs in good faith as the citizens
 
05:09:08.270 --> 05:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
of the state want and expect them to do
 
05:09:09.868 --> 05:09:09.878 align:start position:0%
I understand people are being told that
 
05:09:12.110 --> 05:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
under house bill 1640 it is not the
 
05:09:14.788 --> 05:09:14.798 align:start position:0%
public sector employees assets that are
 
05:09:17.030 --> 05:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
at risk but instead the financial
 
05:09:19.670 --> 05:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
liability will rest with the employers
 
05:09:22.750 --> 05:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
meaning our towns cities counties and
 
05:09:24.590 --> 05:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
state municipalities will hel will be
 
05:09:26.750 --> 05:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
held accountable which ultimately falls
 
05:09:28.030 --> 05:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
on the
 
05:09:30.510 --> 05:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers this bill targets employees
 
05:09:32.830 --> 05:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
actions which will force the employees
 
05:09:35.070 --> 05:09:35.080 align:start position:0%
to defend themselves while financially
 
05:09:38.750 --> 05:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
absorbing the cost out of their own
 
05:09:40.948 --> 05:09:40.958 align:start position:0%
Pockets this bill will likely promote
 
05:09:43.150 --> 05:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
the firing of the employee upon the
 
05:09:45.350 --> 05:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
expanded lawsuit bill when the employee
 
05:09:47.628 --> 05:09:47.638 align:start position:0%
at the time believed they were acting in
 
05:09:49.788 --> 05:09:49.798 align:start position:0%
good fith there is no question this bill
 
05:09:52.110 --> 05:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
will have a direct impact on both local
 
05:09:54.070 --> 05:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
and state government employees and their
 
05:09:55.948 --> 05:09:55.958 align:start position:0%
respected government
 
05:09:58.310 --> 05:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
employers these public sector employees
 
05:10:00.310 --> 05:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
receive limited immunity from some
 
05:10:02.390 --> 05:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
lawsuits while carrying out their job
 
05:10:04.230 --> 05:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
description public employees
 
05:10:06.270 --> 05:10:06.280 align:start position:0%
particularly our police officers perform
 
05:10:08.310 --> 05:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
life-saving tasks that require
 
05:10:10.470 --> 05:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
split-second decisions under very
 
05:10:13.070 --> 05:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
stressful circumstances which are based
 
05:10:15.070 --> 05:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
on good faith that is why police
 
05:10:16.788 --> 05:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
officers received and need limited
 
05:10:18.910 --> 05:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
protection so they won't hesitate when
 
05:10:20.350 --> 05:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
acting on behalf of the public and
 
05:10:21.628 --> 05:10:21.638 align:start position:0%
within their job
 
05:10:23.910 --> 05:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
description contrary to what some people
 
05:10:25.910 --> 05:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
may think police officers do not have
 
05:10:25.920 --> 05:10:26.990 align:start position:0%
may think police officers do not have
absolute

05:10:26.990 --> 05:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
absolute
 
05:10:29.270 --> 05:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
immunity they can be and should be held
 
05:10:31.110 --> 05:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
liable or accountable when they violate
 
05:10:33.350 --> 05:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
personal Constitution tional right they
 
05:10:35.670 --> 05:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
may also be sued when they act outside
 
05:10:38.230 --> 05:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
the scope of their job description or
 
05:10:40.190 --> 05:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
they engage in Reckless Behavior the
 
05:10:41.868 --> 05:10:41.878 align:start position:0%
narrow interpretation of clearly
 
05:10:44.150 --> 05:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
established precedent that exists today
 
05:10:44.160 --> 05:10:44.948 align:start position:0%
established precedent that exists today
is

05:10:44.948 --> 05:10:44.958 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:10:46.990 --> 05:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate the sheer nature of law
 
05:10:48.990 --> 05:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement work means there will be
 
05:10:51.430 --> 05:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
arrest which at the time of arrest may
 
05:10:53.390 --> 05:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
result in possible physical
 
05:10:55.750 --> 05:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
altercations if more and more arrests or
 
05:10:57.948 --> 05:10:57.958 align:start position:0%
the use of force to affect an arrest end
 
05:11:00.390 --> 05:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
up with the threat of Lau the protection
 
05:11:02.510 --> 05:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
of our citizens will be negatively
 
05:11:04.510 --> 05:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
impacted because of the possibility of a
 
05:11:06.990 --> 05:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
negative Financial impact on our police
 
05:11:09.230 --> 05:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
officers and it's not just the police
 
05:11:11.150 --> 05:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
it's other the First Responders one
 
05:11:13.230 --> 05:11:13.240 align:start position:0%
example would be is a local fire
 
05:11:15.110 --> 05:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
department if they were to use all
 
05:11:17.510 --> 05:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
available assets into fighting a fire
 
05:11:19.150 --> 05:11:19.160 align:start position:0%
but the house still Burns to the ground
 
05:11:20.350 --> 05:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
this bill could expose those
 
05:11:22.990 --> 05:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
firefighters to lawsuits even after
 
05:11:25.030 --> 05:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
their heroic
 
05:11:27.670 --> 05:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
efforts finally my testimony today on
 
05:11:28.948 --> 05:11:28.958 align:start position:0%
behalf of the New Hampshire Police
 
05:11:31.270 --> 05:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
Association and its members as well as
 
05:11:33.030 --> 05:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
other law enfor groups like The New
 
05:11:34.910 --> 05:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Troopers Association and the
 
05:11:36.670 --> 05:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Chiefs of Police
 
05:11:38.868 --> 05:11:38.878 align:start position:0%
Association have been very committed to
 
05:11:41.548 --> 05:11:41.558 align:start position:0%
making positive and sensible changes
 
05:11:44.350 --> 05:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
when needed we were active in the law
 
05:11:46.230 --> 05:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement accountability community and
 
05:11:46.240 --> 05:11:48.030 align:start position:0%
enforcement accountability community and
transparency

05:11:48.030 --> 05:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
05:11:50.548 --> 05:11:50.558 align:start position:0%
commission commonly known as Le act and
 
05:11:52.230 --> 05:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
we have worked with people from all
 
05:11:53.868 --> 05:11:53.878 align:start position:0%
sides of the issues to come up with
 
05:11:56.628 --> 05:11:56.638 align:start position:0%
sensible reforms in the areas that we we
 
05:11:58.910 --> 05:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
can all support we have worked with all
 
05:12:00.590 --> 05:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
interested parties and have supported
 
05:12:02.948 --> 05:12:02.958 align:start position:0%
the legislation dealing with misconduct
 
05:12:05.948 --> 05:12:05.958 align:start position:0%
reform um and also pertaining to
 
05:12:08.470 --> 05:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
exculpatory evidence schedule I believe
 
05:12:10.350 --> 05:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
we all can and should be proud of the
 
05:12:11.628 --> 05:12:11.638 align:start position:0%
role New Hampshire law enforcement
 
05:12:14.510 --> 05:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
Community has played in addressing these
 
05:12:16.868 --> 05:12:16.878 align:start position:0%
areas these are the kind of changes that
 
05:12:18.830 --> 05:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
will work this is what the legislative
 
05:12:20.910 --> 05:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
body and the governor expected when they
 
05:12:22.910 --> 05:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
brought all these stakeholders together
 
05:12:25.910 --> 05:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
to resolve these issues within our state
 
05:12:29.030 --> 05:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 1640 is extremely problematic
 
05:12:30.830 --> 05:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
therefore today I strongly urge you to
 
05:12:34.230 --> 05:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
vote hb6 40 in expedient to legislate
 
05:12:35.548 --> 05:12:35.558 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you on behalf of the
 
05:12:37.430 --> 05:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
members of the New Hampshire Police
 
05:12:40.750 --> 05:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
Association questions for this witness
 
05:12:42.868 --> 05:12:42.878 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir next
 
05:12:58.750 --> 05:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:01.270 --> 05:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chairman members of
 
05:13:03.110 --> 05:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
the committee uh I'm going to be very
 
05:13:05.590 --> 05:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
brief uh because we have written
 
05:13:08.150 --> 05:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
testimony to submit I want to begin by
 
05:13:09.830 --> 05:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
saying I am not a lawyer and I am
 
05:13:12.310 --> 05:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
certainly not a constitutional law
 
05:13:15.788 --> 05:13:15.798 align:start position:0%
expert uh but I I do want to Echo the
 
05:13:17.310 --> 05:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
concerns that have already been raised
 
05:13:19.670 --> 05:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
today about Recruitment and Retention
 
05:13:22.110 --> 05:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
this is a very very real problem not
 
05:13:24.430 --> 05:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
just in law enforcement but virtually
 
05:13:27.150 --> 05:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
across all areas of government I was in
 
05:13:28.788 --> 05:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
here just about a week ago on a bill
 
05:13:31.150 --> 05:13:31.160 align:start position:0%
related to School nurses and in
 
05:13:34.110 --> 05:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester alone nine vacancies for
 
05:13:36.230 --> 05:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
School nurses we struggling to fill
 
05:13:38.868 --> 05:13:38.878 align:start position:0%
positions everywhere and legislation
 
05:13:41.590 --> 05:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
like this uh simply does not help it's
 
05:13:43.590 --> 05:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
only going to make matters worse I'll
 
05:13:46.150 --> 05:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
just share a few other thoughts we also
 
05:13:48.670 --> 05:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
represent uh public sector workers and
 
05:13:50.788 --> 05:13:50.798 align:start position:0%
Public Safety in Massachusetts and as
 
05:13:53.350 --> 05:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
you and this committee probably know uh
 
05:13:55.270 --> 05:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
3 or four years back they did the
 
05:13:57.430 --> 05:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
so-called police reform where qualified
 
05:14:00.110 --> 05:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
immunity protections were stripped and I
 
05:14:02.868 --> 05:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
can tell you that it resulted in a mass
 
05:14:05.190 --> 05:14:05.200 align:start position:0%
Exodus uh many of those officers came
 
05:14:07.948 --> 05:14:07.958 align:start position:0%
across the border to work here uh many
 
05:14:10.628 --> 05:14:10.638 align:start position:0%
others retired three four 5 years before
 
05:14:12.948 --> 05:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
they had planned to retire just because
 
05:14:14.830 --> 05:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
of their concern and the their concern
 
05:14:17.708 --> 05:14:17.718 align:start position:0%
is is very very real uh you know whether
 
05:14:20.350 --> 05:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
or not they're they're sued personally
 
05:14:22.430 --> 05:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
for this who who's responsible for it
 
05:14:24.788 --> 05:14:24.798 align:start position:0%
whether it's them or it's the employer
 
05:14:27.590 --> 05:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
ultimately they are pulled in and this
 
05:14:30.470 --> 05:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
legislation allows them to uh intervene
 
05:14:32.670 --> 05:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
or be an intervener and the reason
 
05:14:35.190 --> 05:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to want to do that is
 
05:14:38.948 --> 05:14:38.958 align:start position:0%
because any settlement would uh more
 
05:14:41.590 --> 05:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
than likely result in their termination
 
05:14:43.310 --> 05:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
so if they're not involved in it
 
05:14:44.750 --> 05:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
although they might not lose their home
 
05:14:46.110 --> 05:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
or be sued for their home they're going
 
05:14:48.270 --> 05:14:48.280 align:start position:0%
to lose their job in a settlement which
 
05:14:50.830 --> 05:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
brings me to another Point uh as I said
 
05:14:52.590 --> 05:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not an attorney but I know enough
 
05:14:54.350 --> 05:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
about the profession to know that the
 
05:14:56.590 --> 05:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
quickest and often cheapest way to get
 
05:15:00.990 --> 05:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
rid of a lawsuit is to settle it uh so
 
05:15:03.310 --> 05:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
we believe this is going to result in a
 
05:15:06.350 --> 05:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
number of lawsuits many of them
 
05:15:09.150 --> 05:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
frivolous to be quite honest with you
 
05:15:11.868 --> 05:15:11.878 align:start position:0%
and if the easiest path to do this
 
05:15:14.830 --> 05:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
rather than litigate is to settle where
 
05:15:17.868 --> 05:15:17.878 align:start position:0%
does that ultimately fall uh it it it
 
05:15:19.670 --> 05:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
falls particularly in the rural
 
05:15:21.548 --> 05:15:21.558 align:start position:0%
communities it's going to really hurt
 
05:15:24.868 --> 05:15:24.878 align:start position:0%
the budgets and ultimately if you have a
 
05:15:26.830 --> 05:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
lot of these settlements what's going to
 
05:15:29.350 --> 05:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
happen is fewer police officers like the
 
05:15:31.110 --> 05:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
men and women behind me on the streets
 
05:15:33.628 --> 05:15:33.638 align:start position:0%
fewer teachers in the classroom fuel
 
05:15:37.590 --> 05:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
work is to clear our roads of snow uh so
 
05:15:40.310 --> 05:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
again uh I I know I said I was going to
 
05:15:42.670 --> 05:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
be brief so I'm going to stop here uh
 
05:15:44.350 --> 05:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
I'll give you my written testimony and I
 
05:15:46.750 --> 05:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
will certainly do my best to answer any
 
05:15:48.830 --> 05:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
questions that this committee may have
 
05:15:51.110 --> 05:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
05:15:53.350 --> 05:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
05:15:56.548 --> 05:15:56.558 align:start position:0%
sir I got off easy thank you sir now uh
 
05:16:00.510 --> 05:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:00.520 --> 05:16:06.948 align:start position:0%
 
please

05:16:06.948 --> 05:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:10.110 --> 05:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
welcome scy thank you uh chairman Lynn
 
05:16:11.990 --> 05:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
and uh members of the community uh
 
05:16:14.070 --> 05:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
committee uh I would like to begin by
 
05:16:16.270 --> 05:16:16.280 align:start position:0%
saying something nobody has said yet
 
05:16:17.750 --> 05:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
Happy Valentine's
 
05:16:21.030 --> 05:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
Day um it's a beautiful day for
 
05:16:22.910 --> 05:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
Valentine's Day and uh I'll try to keep
 
05:16:24.910 --> 05:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
my comments relatively short because I
 
05:16:26.830 --> 05:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
know you've heard a lot of testimony but
 
05:16:29.430 --> 05:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
I did want to clarify a couple of things
 
05:16:31.110 --> 05:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
um there was a statement in regards to
 
05:16:34.590 --> 05:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
account ability for for public employees
 
05:16:36.628 --> 05:16:36.638 align:start position:0%
there are many levels of accountability
 
05:16:38.990 --> 05:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
already existing for public employees
 
05:16:41.070 --> 05:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
the first line of accountability is
 
05:16:44.030 --> 05:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
their employers themselves every state
 
05:16:46.350 --> 05:16:46.360 align:start position:0%
agency uh that hires law enforcement
 
05:16:48.150 --> 05:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
individuals have their own Internal
 
05:16:50.910 --> 05:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
Affairs bureaus
 
05:16:53.670 --> 05:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
which which act as the Frontline of
 
05:16:55.990 --> 05:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
Defense in addition to that you have
 
05:16:57.750 --> 05:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
police standards and
 
05:16:59.910 --> 05:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
training which has a misconduct
 
05:17:01.830 --> 05:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
Committee in which complaints will be
 
05:17:04.670 --> 05:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
filed and every complaint is reviewed in
 
05:17:07.310 --> 05:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
terms of other public employees you have
 
05:17:09.430 --> 05:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
Professional Licensing Board in which
 
05:17:12.750 --> 05:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
they are held accountable and yes public
 
05:17:16.510 --> 05:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
employees may be sued civy under the
 
05:17:20.830 --> 05:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
current law however that individual must
 
05:17:22.510 --> 05:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
act outside of the scope of their
 
05:17:24.750 --> 05:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
employment and act in a wanting or
 
05:17:27.750 --> 05:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
Reckless fashion that is the
 
05:17:31.868 --> 05:17:31.878 align:start position:0%
standard now accountability takes place
 
05:17:33.708 --> 05:17:33.718 align:start position:0%
and and already takes place and we see
 
05:17:33.718 --> 05:17:34.750 align:start position:0%
and and already takes place and we see
that

05:17:34.750 --> 05:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:17:38.310 --> 05:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
already the other issue that came up is
 
05:17:41.510 --> 05:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional viability uh or the
 
05:17:45.230 --> 05:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
standard that set forth this creates a
 
05:17:47.590 --> 05:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
cause of action for any constitutional
 
05:17:51.030 --> 05:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
violation I think we can all agree that
 
05:17:54.788 --> 05:17:54.798 align:start position:0%
we are a government of laws created at
 
05:17:57.350 --> 05:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
the foundation by our constitution all
 
05:17:59.990 --> 05:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
of our laws derive from our
 
05:18:01.910 --> 05:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
constitution so
 
05:18:04.350 --> 05:18:04.360 align:start position:0%
let me give you an example uh I believe
 
05:18:06.270 --> 05:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
a question was asked what about just a
 
05:18:09.070 --> 05:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
paperwork violate well you know the
 
05:18:11.190 --> 05:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
right to information is is a
 
05:18:14.430 --> 05:18:14.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional right 91a comes off of a
 
05:18:17.590 --> 05:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional right so if for example
 
05:18:21.628 --> 05:18:21.638 align:start position:0%
say a clerk um gets a 91a request runs
 
05:18:24.390 --> 05:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
it by legal they say you can do X Y and
 
05:18:26.910 --> 05:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
Z redacts it but leaves a date of birth
 
05:18:30.470 --> 05:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
on the um on on something that goes out
 
05:18:32.030 --> 05:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
a simple mistake
 
05:18:35.150 --> 05:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
no harm no fail it's corrected and no
 
05:18:37.390 --> 05:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
one ever sees it that individual can say
 
05:18:39.788 --> 05:18:39.798 align:start position:0%
you violated my privacy act my privacy
 
05:18:41.590 --> 05:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
rights which is also a constitutional
 
05:18:43.670 --> 05:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
rights that individual would be subject
 
05:18:47.230 --> 05:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
to according to this law per se
 
05:18:50.270 --> 05:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
termination per se termination no
 
05:18:52.548 --> 05:18:52.558 align:start position:0%
mitigating factors nothing to be
 
05:18:56.628 --> 05:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
reviewed per se it would also give
 
05:18:58.948 --> 05:18:58.958 align:start position:0%
attorney fees to the person bringing
 
05:19:01.910 --> 05:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
that action and why because some of
 
05:19:03.510 --> 05:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
these issues already are contained in
 
05:19:06.990 --> 05:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
the law if someone brings a bad faith or
 
05:19:09.670 --> 05:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
frivolous action the courts already have
 
05:19:12.070 --> 05:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
the right to award attorney fees against
 
05:19:15.750 --> 05:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
that party here you also have the right
 
05:19:18.548 --> 05:19:18.558 align:start position:0%
to get attorney fees if you do something
 
05:19:21.230 --> 05:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
in the public interest what this bill
 
05:19:22.470 --> 05:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
does though and it's the most
 
05:19:25.150 --> 05:19:25.160 align:start position:0%
far-reaching attorney fees Bill I've
 
05:19:28.390 --> 05:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
ever seen it automatically Awards
 
05:19:31.708 --> 05:19:31.718 align:start position:0%
attorney fees for any prevailing
 
05:19:34.070 --> 05:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
plaintiff prevailing plaintiff under the
 
05:19:36.190 --> 05:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
current law is that you have to have a
 
05:19:39.548 --> 05:19:39.558 align:start position:0%
judgment against the other individual on
 
05:19:41.910 --> 05:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
a majority of your claims so if you
 
05:19:44.788 --> 05:19:44.798 align:start position:0%
brought 23 claims you're not going to be
 
05:19:47.310 --> 05:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
the prevailing party for all 23 of those
 
05:19:50.510 --> 05:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
claims maybe only one of those claims
 
05:19:53.390 --> 05:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
okay this says any claim so if I bring
 
05:19:57.670 --> 05:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
23 claims and I run up a a bill of
 
05:20:00.948 --> 05:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
$300,000 the town or city or state would
 
05:20:03.270 --> 05:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
be responsible to pay that whole
 
05:20:07.190 --> 05:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
$300,000 even if it was about a minor
 
05:20:10.510 --> 05:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
violation and it's not a May every other
 
05:20:12.910 --> 05:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
prevailing or fees shifting bill that
 
05:20:16.910 --> 05:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
I've reviewed says the court May award
 
05:20:19.510 --> 05:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
this bill says you shall
 
05:20:23.390 --> 05:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
award it gives an incentive uh uh to
 
05:20:26.430 --> 05:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
bring relatively nonmeritorious claims
 
05:20:29.670 --> 05:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
forward for the sake of gaining
 
05:20:31.910 --> 05:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
money in addition ition I would like to
 
05:20:34.788 --> 05:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
clarify something that um uh was stated
 
05:20:37.590 --> 05:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
earlier in regards to uh this provides a
 
05:20:40.070 --> 05:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
disincentive to correct things there
 
05:20:42.430 --> 05:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
there is a a theory in the law and it's
 
05:20:44.470 --> 05:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
under the negligence uh when you're
 
05:20:46.948 --> 05:20:46.958 align:start position:0%
looking at negligence is that if I take
 
05:20:49.430 --> 05:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
a remedial action it can't be used
 
05:20:51.510 --> 05:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
against me in a court of law because I'm
 
05:20:53.708 --> 05:20:53.718 align:start position:0%
correcting a problem and public policy
 
05:20:55.948 --> 05:20:55.958 align:start position:0%
says you should correct problems rather
 
05:20:58.070 --> 05:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
than have to litigate it to get it
 
05:21:00.270 --> 05:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
corrected that's why it's not allowed in
 
05:21:02.110 --> 05:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
court when you take subsequent remedial
 
05:21:04.670 --> 05:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
action to correct the problem for
 
05:21:09.310 --> 05:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
example if I um never Sal my driveway
 
05:21:11.110 --> 05:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
and somebody falls and gets hurt and
 
05:21:13.628 --> 05:21:13.638 align:start position:0%
thereafter I salt it every day and no
 
05:21:15.830 --> 05:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
one falls again they can't use my
 
05:21:18.070 --> 05:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
subsequent salting of that driveway
 
05:21:20.110 --> 05:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
against me because I did the right thing
 
05:21:22.510 --> 05:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
and nobody else got hurt what I might do
 
05:21:23.670 --> 05:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
is say well if I'm going to get in
 
05:21:25.190 --> 05:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
trouble I'm not going to give them a
 
05:21:26.788 --> 05:21:26.798 align:start position:0%
reason to get me in trouble I'm not
 
05:21:29.150 --> 05:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
going to assult my driveway at all and
 
05:21:31.230 --> 05:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
that does not help public policy the
 
05:21:33.470 --> 05:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
same thing would happen in regards to
 
05:21:35.430 --> 05:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
the government don't correct a problem
 
05:21:37.190 --> 05:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
until they tell you it's a problem
 
05:21:39.190 --> 05:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
because if you do you put yourself into
 
05:21:42.030 --> 05:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
liability and per se liability when you
 
05:21:45.150 --> 05:21:45.160 align:start position:0%
say the individual um actor would not be
 
05:21:47.910 --> 05:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
this creates a standard in regards to
 
05:21:50.150 --> 05:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
per se this is the only statute I've
 
05:21:52.628 --> 05:21:52.638 align:start position:0%
ever seen that creates a per
 
05:21:55.628 --> 05:21:55.638 align:start position:0%
se requirement of termination it says it
 
05:21:58.350 --> 05:21:58.360 align:start position:0%
is a per se reason to terminate that
 
05:22:01.510 --> 05:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
would overturn overturn years
 
05:22:03.708 --> 05:22:03.718 align:start position:0%
of collective bargaining within the
 
05:22:06.230 --> 05:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and take away
 
05:22:06.240 --> 05:22:07.070 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and take away
take

05:22:07.070 --> 05:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
take
 
05:22:09.548 --> 05:22:09.558 align:start position:0%
away property rights that individuals
 
05:22:10.910 --> 05:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
have because when you have a just cause
 
05:22:12.590 --> 05:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
provision in your collective bargaining
 
05:22:13.948 --> 05:22:13.958 align:start position:0%
agreement you have a property right in
 
05:22:15.990 --> 05:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
your job does that mean the legislature
 
05:22:18.230 --> 05:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
in doing this should be held liable for
 
05:22:21.430 --> 05:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
taking away a police officer's uh uh
 
05:22:23.590 --> 05:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights no that would be a
 
05:22:25.830 --> 05:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
ridiculous result and by the way the con
 
05:22:29.548 --> 05:22:29.558 align:start position:0%
this this bill does provide immunity for
 
05:22:32.350 --> 05:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
legislators and judges and it should and
 
05:22:34.590 --> 05:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
it should but those protections that you
 
05:22:37.230 --> 05:22:37.240 align:start position:0%
see as important for you to exercise
 
05:22:39.350 --> 05:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
your discretionary functions at the
 
05:22:41.670 --> 05:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
highest level of government should also
 
05:22:44.150 --> 05:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
be applied to those who are the people
 
05:22:46.510 --> 05:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
who are implementing the policies and
 
05:22:49.948 --> 05:22:49.958 align:start position:0%
procedures dictated by others and with
 
05:22:53.948 --> 05:22:53.958 align:start position:0%
that being said um I will uh yield my
 
05:22:57.548 --> 05:22:57.558 align:start position:0%
time to whoever uh is is be Beyond me
 
05:23:00.070 --> 05:23:00.080 align:start position:0%

again uh next I'm going to call on
 
05:23:29.868 --> 05:23:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:29.878 --> 05:23:34.310 align:start position:0%
 
please

05:23:34.310 --> 05:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:36.070 --> 05:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair members of
 
05:23:38.350 --> 05:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
the committee everybody in the audience
 
05:23:40.708 --> 05:23:40.718 align:start position:0%
it's good to um see so many people
 
05:23:42.830 --> 05:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
paying so much attention to an important
 
05:23:46.948 --> 05:23:46.958 align:start position:0%
bill I'd like to um move through this as
 
05:23:49.788 --> 05:23:49.798 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible and um first address
 
05:23:51.670 --> 05:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
a couple of concerns about the language
 
05:23:53.270 --> 05:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
of the bill that were raised earlier one
 
05:23:56.750 --> 05:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
that it would give um um permission to
 
05:23:58.708 --> 05:23:58.718 align:start position:0%
proxy lawsuits on behalf of somebody
 
05:24:00.990 --> 05:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
else looking at the language I think
 
05:24:03.150 --> 05:24:03.160 align:start position:0%
that literally requires a
 
05:24:06.030 --> 05:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
two-word amendment in page three
 
05:24:08.070 --> 05:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
paragraph Roman numeral 2 instead of
 
05:24:10.310 --> 05:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
saying violation of a right it should
 
05:24:13.510 --> 05:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
say violation of their rights and if you
 
05:24:16.390 --> 05:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
look down the same page page three at
 
05:24:19.750 --> 05:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
the bottom under 541
 
05:24:22.990 --> 05:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
B27 instead of saying use of force if
 
05:24:25.150 --> 05:24:25.160 align:start position:0%
that says actions the protections become
 
05:24:27.230 --> 05:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
much broader and do not apply just to a
 
05:24:30.430 --> 05:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
specific scenario those are very minor
 
05:24:31.868 --> 05:24:31.878 align:start position:0%
adjust last months I already spoke with
 
05:24:34.590 --> 05:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
a prime sponsor we'll be happy to amend
 
05:24:36.350 --> 05:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
you know the bill to just eliminate
 
05:24:37.948 --> 05:24:37.958 align:start position:0%
those two concerns right off the bat
 
05:24:39.110 --> 05:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
because they are reasonable and they
 
05:24:40.830 --> 05:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
were definitely not
 
05:24:45.708 --> 05:24:45.718 align:start position:0%
intentional now in regards to a lot of
 
05:24:48.628 --> 05:24:48.638 align:start position:0%
the U claims being made do you notice
 
05:24:51.548 --> 05:24:51.558 align:start position:0%
how many of them are around the
 
05:24:53.628 --> 05:24:53.638 align:start position:0%
split-second decisions people have to
 
05:24:56.150 --> 05:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
make that's a reasonable concern from
 
05:24:58.190 --> 05:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
people who have to make split level
 
05:25:01.110 --> 05:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
decisions right Split Second decisions
 
05:25:03.990 --> 05:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
you know you just got to decide right
 
05:25:07.390 --> 05:25:07.400 align:start position:0%
now first we do have specific language
 
05:25:09.230 --> 05:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
that you know was just we were just
 
05:25:11.708 --> 05:25:11.718 align:start position:0%
looking at that explicitly states that
 
05:25:13.750 --> 05:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
the court will consider those and give
 
05:25:15.750 --> 05:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
them the benefit of the doubt for those
 
05:25:17.628 --> 05:25:17.638 align:start position:0%
circumstances if there is any way to
 
05:25:19.190 --> 05:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
make that even stronger for those
 
05:25:22.190 --> 05:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
scenarios I'd be happy to but you know I
 
05:25:23.910 --> 05:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to make it even
 
05:25:26.390 --> 05:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
stronger than it is but the fact is if
 
05:25:29.150 --> 05:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
you look at the data the vast majority
 
05:25:32.190 --> 05:25:32.200 align:start position:0%
of qualified immunity claims are not
 
05:25:34.430 --> 05:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
against those types of scenarios yes
 
05:25:36.990 --> 05:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
they are about a quarter or a third of
 
05:25:39.830 --> 05:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
the cases but the majority of qualified
 
05:25:42.910 --> 05:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
immunity claims are for actions of
 
05:25:45.390 --> 05:25:45.400 align:start position:0%
government employees who had plenty of
 
05:25:47.788 --> 05:25:47.798 align:start position:0%
time to consider their choices and yet
 
05:25:49.110 --> 05:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
chose to
 
05:25:51.390 --> 05:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
disregard you know laws and
 
05:25:53.470 --> 05:25:53.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights and right now the
 
05:25:55.510 --> 05:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity
 
05:25:57.910 --> 05:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
Doctrine is one of those doctrines
 
05:26:00.788 --> 05:26:00.798 align:start position:0%
that's written in a very reasonable way
 
05:26:03.430 --> 05:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
right he just says that hey you know you
 
05:26:06.150 --> 05:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't violate rights if the police
 
05:26:08.990 --> 05:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
officer can be expected to be aware that
 
05:26:10.788 --> 05:26:10.798 align:start position:0%
you know those are rights and they were
 
05:26:13.548 --> 05:26:13.558 align:start position:0%
established you can bring action in
 
05:26:17.868 --> 05:26:17.878 align:start position:0%
reality courts have led to some
 
05:26:20.270 --> 05:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
impressive verdicts if I could just
 
05:26:23.470 --> 05:26:23.480 align:start position:0%
bring up Jessup versus Fresno by the way
 
05:26:25.750 --> 05:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
I intentionally chose a California case
 
05:26:27.390 --> 05:26:27.400 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to go after one
 
05:26:29.070 --> 05:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
individual Department in New Hampshire
 
05:26:31.548 --> 05:26:31.558 align:start position:0%
or another the issues are very similar I
 
05:26:33.310 --> 05:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
don't want this to come across as
 
05:26:35.430 --> 05:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
picking on one city
 
05:26:38.390 --> 05:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
right in that case uh two police
 
05:26:40.708 --> 05:26:40.718 align:start position:0%
officers served a legitimate arrest
 
05:26:42.070 --> 05:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
legitimate search warrant They
 
05:26:44.110 --> 05:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
confiscated about
 
05:26:47.270 --> 05:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
$275,000 in cash and coins and they
 
05:26:51.670 --> 05:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:55.150 --> 05:26:55.160 align:start position:0%
50,000 District 9 ruled that while
 
05:26:57.510 --> 05:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
stealing is morally wrong those police
 
05:26:59.390 --> 05:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
officers really had no clearly
 
05:27:02.190 --> 05:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
established case laws to inform them
 
05:27:04.270 --> 05:27:04.280 align:start position:0%
that stealing from a suspect is a
 
05:27:06.788 --> 05:27:06.798 align:start position:0%
violation of their rights and therefore
 
05:27:09.548 --> 05:27:09.558 align:start position:0%
no civil action can be brought this is
 
05:27:11.590 --> 05:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
where qualified
 
05:27:14.948 --> 05:27:14.958 align:start position:0%
immunity is excessive
 
05:27:18.190 --> 05:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
where you know we pretend that somehow a
 
05:27:20.670 --> 05:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
police officer who does not understand
 
05:27:23.070 --> 05:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
that stealing is
 
05:27:28.070 --> 05:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
illegal would be aware of the case law
 
05:27:30.110 --> 05:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
hundreds and thousands of Supreme Court
 
05:27:32.628 --> 05:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
and local District's decisions that
 
05:27:34.310 --> 05:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
would then inform them that really
 
05:27:36.110 --> 05:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
stealing has been established to be
 
05:27:39.590 --> 05:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
illegal mind you the this Ninth District
 
05:27:41.590 --> 05:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
did not even rule on whether stealing
 
05:27:43.628 --> 05:27:43.638 align:start position:0%
was illegal under those circumstances
 
05:27:46.590 --> 05:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
therefore allowing the same Doctrine to
 
05:27:49.270 --> 05:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
be used again in similar circumstances
 
05:27:52.030 --> 05:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
if other police officers commit exactly
 
05:27:56.270 --> 05:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
the same crime this is a real concern
 
05:28:00.070 --> 05:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
okay and it needs to be addressed we are
 
05:28:02.750 --> 05:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
not in any way trying to attack police
 
05:28:05.310 --> 05:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
officers or make it harder for them to
 
05:28:08.430 --> 05:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
retain people if anything it's kind of
 
05:28:10.948 --> 05:28:10.958 align:start position:0%
strange to see everybody in here being
 
05:28:13.830 --> 05:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
unhappy about the fact that this uh
 
05:28:15.948 --> 05:28:15.958 align:start position:0%
legislation would shift the burden from
 
05:28:17.910 --> 05:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
the employer to the
 
05:28:20.310 --> 05:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
employee I can assure you that if we
 
05:28:22.270 --> 05:28:22.280 align:start position:0%
didn't do that everybody would tell you
 
05:28:24.190 --> 05:28:24.200 align:start position:0%
that it's absolutely unacceptable for a
 
05:28:26.190 --> 05:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
police officer to risk going bankrupt
 
05:28:29.070 --> 05:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
over one decision that they made and we
 
05:28:31.150 --> 05:28:31.160 align:start position:0%
agree with that which is why we are
 
05:28:32.830 --> 05:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
shifting the responsibility to the
 
05:28:35.270 --> 05:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
employer which has larger pockets and
 
05:28:37.070 --> 05:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately the responsibility for
 
05:28:38.990 --> 05:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
training and hiring and retaining those
 
05:28:43.110 --> 05:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
people so I would urge the committee
 
05:28:46.230 --> 05:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
to consider the fact that this is the
 
05:28:50.230 --> 05:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
right way to do this and you know not be
 
05:28:52.150 --> 05:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
that very concerned about that shifting
 
05:28:53.070 --> 05:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:28:55.990 --> 05:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
liability one other comment that I heard
 
05:28:59.110 --> 05:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh from a previous uh person testifying
 
05:29:02.030 --> 05:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
was that we have to retain contractors
 
05:29:03.590 --> 05:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
and they are not trained and we don't
 
05:29:07.070 --> 05:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
want to indemnify them well if you hire
 
05:29:09.310 --> 05:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
them to do work on your behalf you are
 
05:29:11.590 --> 05:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
responsible for their actions if you
 
05:29:13.830 --> 05:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
don't like it don't hire contractors and
 
05:29:15.788 --> 05:29:15.798 align:start position:0%
do the work yourself I don't think you
 
05:29:18.670 --> 05:29:18.680 align:start position:0%
should be able to shield from actions
 
05:29:20.390 --> 05:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
from the consequences of actions
 
05:29:22.390 --> 05:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
committed by people you authorize to do
 
05:29:24.350 --> 05:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
work on your behalf when they break the
 
05:29:26.670 --> 05:29:26.680 align:start position:0%
law it's your responsibility to hire
 
05:29:28.548 --> 05:29:28.558 align:start position:0%
people who are qualified and won't break
 
05:29:28.558 --> 05:29:29.310 align:start position:0%
people who are qualified and won't break
the

05:29:29.310 --> 05:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:29:29.320 --> 05:29:31.990 align:start position:0%
the
law

05:29:31.990 --> 05:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:29:34.230 --> 05:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
the real real issue
 
05:29:37.910 --> 05:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
here is that sometimes things happen
 
05:29:41.390 --> 05:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
that are absolutely wrong and yet courts
 
05:29:44.670 --> 05:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
use qualified immunity to not rule
 
05:29:46.910 --> 05:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
against the plain tis but not even give
 
05:29:48.628 --> 05:29:48.638 align:start position:0%
them the chance to make their case in
 
05:29:50.910 --> 05:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
courts because mind you having the
 
05:29:53.150 --> 05:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
ability to make your case in courts by
 
05:29:54.868 --> 05:29:54.878 align:start position:0%
no way means you'll Prevail against the
 
05:29:54.878 --> 05:29:55.990 align:start position:0%
no way means you'll Prevail against the
government

05:29:55.990 --> 05:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:29:59.030 --> 05:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
agency okay odds are uh not very
 
05:30:01.470 --> 05:30:01.480 align:start position:0%
favorable for people who make those kind
 
05:30:01.480 --> 05:30:02.788 align:start position:0%
favorable for people who make those kind
of

05:30:02.788 --> 05:30:02.798 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:30:05.750 --> 05:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
claims one last thing and really there
 
05:30:07.350 --> 05:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
is much more I could say but this has
 
05:30:08.910 --> 05:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
gone for a long time and I want to
 
05:30:12.110 --> 05:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
respect everybody's time is
 
05:30:15.350 --> 05:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
that I've always believed in talking to
 
05:30:17.190 --> 05:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
everybody involved and working with them
 
05:30:19.310 --> 05:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
and trying to address concerns I hope
 
05:30:21.310 --> 05:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
that this bill will be passed if it
 
05:30:23.310 --> 05:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't get passed I'm looking forward
 
05:30:25.868 --> 05:30:25.878 align:start position:0%
to working with everybody who Express
 
05:30:29.150 --> 05:30:29.160 align:start position:0%
concerns to see whether we can find some
 
05:30:33.230 --> 05:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
way to address those very real problems
 
05:30:36.230 --> 05:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
because these issues are real they
 
05:30:38.948 --> 05:30:38.958 align:start position:0%
affect people and we do need to address
 
05:30:41.548 --> 05:30:41.558 align:start position:0%
them and if this is not the right
 
05:30:44.788 --> 05:30:44.798 align:start position:0%
vehicle fine we'll just have to figure
 
05:30:47.270 --> 05:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
out what the right vehicle is but until
 
05:30:49.590 --> 05:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
those issues are addressed we're going
 
05:30:52.590 --> 05:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
to meet every year in the committee room
 
05:30:56.390 --> 05:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
and try to find another way to do it so
 
05:30:58.270 --> 05:30:58.280 align:start position:0%
one way or the other we have to find a
 
05:30:59.868 --> 05:30:59.878 align:start position:0%
way to address this and I would urge the
 
05:31:02.628 --> 05:31:02.638 align:start position:0%
commit to if there are aspects of this
 
05:31:04.670 --> 05:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
that are not acceptable to maybe make a
 
05:31:06.548 --> 05:31:06.558 align:start position:0%
suggestion on how to fix them that I'm
 
05:31:08.750 --> 05:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
sure we'll be happy to work with thank
 
05:31:10.190 --> 05:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
you and I'll be happy to take any
 
05:31:12.990 --> 05:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this
 
05:31:15.948 --> 05:31:15.958 align:start position:0%
witness oh yes represent
 
05:31:18.110 --> 05:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
stap thank you and thank you for taking
 
05:31:20.948 --> 05:31:20.958 align:start position:0%
my question I think I missed I missed
 
05:31:23.350 --> 05:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
you said that there's a possible area
 
05:31:26.470 --> 05:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
for amendment in this bill if I've got
 
05:31:29.270 --> 05:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
that right what area was that I I
 
05:31:31.150 --> 05:31:31.160 align:start position:0%
already suggested at the very beginning
 
05:31:32.910 --> 05:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
two minor amendments to address two of
 
05:31:36.150 --> 05:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
the concerns U here one to make sure
 
05:31:39.150 --> 05:31:39.160 align:start position:0%
there is no proxy right to file lawsuits
 
05:31:40.708 --> 05:31:40.718 align:start position:0%
on behalf of somebody else which is
 
05:31:43.150 --> 05:31:43.160 align:start position:0%
definitely not the intent another one to
 
05:31:45.548 --> 05:31:45.558 align:start position:0%
extend the protections at the bottom of
 
05:31:48.030 --> 05:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
page three to all government employee
 
05:31:50.350 --> 05:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
actions not just use of force what I was
 
05:31:52.470 --> 05:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
saying at the end was that if the
 
05:31:54.788 --> 05:31:54.798 align:start position:0%
committee feels that certain
 
05:31:57.510 --> 05:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
improvements to the bill would make it
 
05:32:01.510 --> 05:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
useful more useful I'm sure that both me
 
05:32:03.190 --> 05:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
and the primary sponsor will be willing
 
05:32:06.350 --> 05:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
to work and address you know as much of
 
05:32:09.070 --> 05:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
those concerns and hopefully you know
 
05:32:10.350 --> 05:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
have a bill that the committee is
 
05:32:12.150 --> 05:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
comfortable recommended for recommending
 
05:32:12.160 --> 05:32:13.030 align:start position:0%
comfortable recommended for recommending
for

05:32:13.030 --> 05:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:32:16.310 --> 05:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
OTP thank you other questions for this
 
05:32:18.670 --> 05:32:18.680 align:start position:0%
witness I guess I do have one question
 
05:32:21.590 --> 05:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative papich M uh you made you
 
05:32:23.948 --> 05:32:23.958 align:start position:0%
made reference to the ninth circuit case
 
05:32:26.990 --> 05:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
about the you know the the police
 
05:32:29.670 --> 05:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
officers didn't know that uh when you
 
05:32:33.150 --> 05:32:33.160 align:start position:0%
when you sees $200,000 it's not proper
 
05:32:35.708 --> 05:32:35.718 align:start position:0%
to report you only so sees 50 and keep
 
05:32:39.030 --> 05:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
the rest yes um yeah obviously that you
 
05:32:42.788 --> 05:32:42.798 align:start position:0%
know when I hear those kind of decisions
 
05:32:44.948 --> 05:32:44.958 align:start position:0%
that concerns me as much as I'm I'm sure
 
05:32:49.070 --> 05:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
it does you but have can you give us an
 
05:32:52.150 --> 05:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
exam an example of those kinds of
 
05:32:54.190 --> 05:32:54.200 align:start position:0%
decisions being made by courts in New
 
05:32:57.350 --> 05:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I mean is this I U is this a
 
05:33:00.628 --> 05:33:00.638 align:start position:0%
problem in New Hampshire it is a problem
 
05:33:03.030 --> 05:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire if not of the magnitude
 
05:33:05.190 --> 05:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
of what the ninth circuit will
 
05:33:08.990 --> 05:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
do I at this point in time intentionally
 
05:33:11.070 --> 05:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
chose not to have any examples from New
 
05:33:12.830 --> 05:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because I'm concerned that if
 
05:33:14.750 --> 05:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
I start bringing up specific cases it
 
05:33:17.150 --> 05:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
will come across as chasing individual
 
05:33:20.350 --> 05:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
towns and stuff I'd be happy to um you
 
05:33:23.990 --> 05:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
know for now rest my arguments on the
 
05:33:26.230 --> 05:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
general concerns rather than look at the
 
05:33:29.030 --> 05:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
individual New Hampshire decisions if
 
05:33:30.430 --> 05:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
there is a change with we need to make
 
05:33:32.628 --> 05:33:32.638 align:start position:0%
to this approach in the fut future I'll
 
05:33:34.350 --> 05:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
be happy to but I don't want to speak
 
05:33:38.070 --> 05:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
off the cuff and uh change horses right
 
05:33:40.350 --> 05:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
you know at the last moment okay all
 
05:33:43.070 --> 05:33:43.080 align:start position:0%

I just wanted to either it's educational
 
05:35:05.628 --> 05:35:05.638 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to learn you know as you
 
05:35:08.390 --> 05:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
heard from the previous speaker
 
05:35:11.510 --> 05:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
that the example that we were given here
 
05:35:14.030 --> 05:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
was a case from State of
 
05:35:17.030 --> 05:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
California and it's really Troublesome
 
05:35:19.868 --> 05:35:19.878 align:start position:0%
do we have a problem currently in the
 
05:35:22.788 --> 05:35:22.798 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that really
 
05:35:26.350 --> 05:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
directly have any kind of concern about
 
05:35:29.310 --> 05:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
qualifying immunity all right uh most of
 
05:35:31.990 --> 05:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
the time we try to adapt these policies
 
05:35:34.868 --> 05:35:34.878 align:start position:0%
that apply in other states cases that
 
05:35:36.990 --> 05:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
generate from and I understand
 
05:35:39.788 --> 05:35:39.798 align:start position:0%
about creating a preventive measure so
 
05:35:42.350 --> 05:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
we can protect our state and quite
 
05:35:43.750 --> 05:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
frankly speaking I've been in law
 
05:35:47.150 --> 05:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement for 22 years State of New
 
05:35:49.310 --> 05:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has probably one of the best
 
05:35:50.788 --> 05:35:50.798 align:start position:0%
mechanism through the New Hampshire
 
05:35:53.350 --> 05:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
police standard training Council and the
 
05:35:55.510 --> 05:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
based licensing agencies and departments
 
05:35:57.910 --> 05:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
through the state to make sure
 
05:36:00.590 --> 05:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
that public employees are not immune
 
05:36:04.548 --> 05:36:04.558 align:start position:0%
from the Mal ass intent now if any
 
05:36:06.708 --> 05:36:06.718 align:start position:0%
officer or Public Employee has done
 
05:36:09.270 --> 05:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
something outrageous that violated the
 
05:36:11.788 --> 05:36:11.798 align:start position:0%
policy of the department I think every
 
05:36:14.230 --> 05:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
Department every state agency has their
 
05:36:16.230 --> 05:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
own unit to investigate and determine
 
05:36:18.430 --> 05:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not if that person would even
 
05:36:22.390 --> 05:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
get a protection from the state uh I
 
05:36:25.110 --> 05:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
would love to see if there is any data
 
05:36:27.190 --> 05:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
which shows we actually have a problem I
 
05:36:29.470 --> 05:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
believe I firmly believe that state of
 
05:36:32.030 --> 05:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
New Hamshire we do not have that problem
 
05:36:35.708 --> 05:36:35.718 align:start position:0%
it's a non-existent issue uh I think uh
 
05:36:38.628 --> 05:36:38.638 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh we create laws that don't
 
05:36:41.590 --> 05:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
apply for us and then we now are putting
 
05:36:44.270 --> 05:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
our public servants in a position where
 
05:36:47.350 --> 05:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
they may be hesitant about acting uh and
 
05:36:49.510 --> 05:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
doing their their job I think the public
 
05:36:51.590 --> 05:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
employees uh in this state do a great
 
05:36:54.270 --> 05:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
job uh I have B I've been involved with
 
05:36:56.510 --> 05:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
training I'm also an agent professor at
 
05:36:58.788 --> 05:36:58.798 align:start position:0%
the universities I have researched and
 
05:37:02.150 --> 05:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
read many many reports about specific
 
05:37:05.390 --> 05:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
topic to qualifying immunity and I would
 
05:37:07.990 --> 05:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
dare to say that this state have no zero
 
05:37:10.788 --> 05:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
non-existent issue and if there are they
 
05:37:11.868 --> 05:37:11.878 align:start position:0%
are addressed through the police
 
05:37:14.070 --> 05:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
standard training Council or through the
 
05:37:17.430 --> 05:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
state uh uh agencies that are tasked in
 
05:37:21.110 --> 05:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
investigating and addressing uh any uh
 
05:37:23.670 --> 05:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
misconduct uh in any kind of uh
 
05:37:26.430 --> 05:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
employment so uh it's an nonexistent
 
05:37:28.190 --> 05:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
issue that's like I would like to add
 
05:37:29.628 --> 05:37:29.638 align:start position:0%

05:39:49.708 --> 05:39:49.718 align:start position:0%
1614 good government allows everyone to
 
05:39:51.830 --> 05:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
have their day in
 
05:39:53.990 --> 05:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
court and they can present their whole
 
05:39:56.390 --> 05:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
case not starting with a giant thumb on
 
05:39:59.070 --> 05:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
the scale assuming that a state agency
 
05:40:01.310 --> 05:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
is always right unless they've made some
 
05:40:04.430 --> 05:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
egregious error of fact or law most of
 
05:40:06.190 --> 05:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
the problems that bad decisions cause
 
05:40:08.070 --> 05:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily errors but mistakes
 
05:40:08.080 --> 05:40:08.830 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily errors but mistakes
of

05:40:08.830 --> 05:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:40:11.110 --> 05:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
judgment we should have a system that
 
05:40:14.628 --> 05:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
allows appeal of bad judgment this bill
 
05:40:16.670 --> 05:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
establishes a new framework for review
 
05:40:19.390 --> 05:40:19.400 align:start position:0%
of decisions and rules of the Department
 
05:40:21.270 --> 05:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services to give less
 
05:40:24.310 --> 05:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
deference to agency decisions and prior
 
05:40:26.390 --> 05:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
quasi Court review through agency
 
05:40:29.350 --> 05:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
councils this bill will address fairness
 
05:40:31.310 --> 05:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
and the judicial standard for review of
 
05:40:33.150 --> 05:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
appeals of Dees
 
05:40:35.150 --> 05:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
decisions in our representative
 
05:40:37.030 --> 05:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
democracy there is and there very much
 
05:40:38.948 --> 05:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
should be a basic bargain between the
 
05:40:41.150 --> 05:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
citizens and the administrative State
 
05:40:43.270 --> 05:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
administrative agencies such as Dees
 
05:40:45.430 --> 05:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
have substantial power given to them by
 
05:40:47.910 --> 05:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature to write regulations and
 
05:40:50.910 --> 05:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
issue permits on the other hand affected
 
05:40:53.628 --> 05:40:53.638 align:start position:0%
voters and taxpayers are supposed to be
 
05:40:56.350 --> 05:40:56.360 align:start position:0%
able to provide factual information
 
05:40:59.788 --> 05:40:59.798 align:start position:0%
scientific economic Etc along with their
 
05:41:02.708 --> 05:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
views about the policy wisdom or ethical
 
05:41:05.310 --> 05:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
basis for regulation or for a project SE
 
05:41:08.030 --> 05:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
seeking a permit if everything works
 
05:41:10.670 --> 05:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
perfectly the agency makes a decision
 
05:41:12.230 --> 05:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
and anyone who believes strongly that
 
05:41:13.708 --> 05:41:13.718 align:start position:0%
the decision is too strict or too
 
05:41:15.510 --> 05:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
lenient has an opportunity to appeal
 
05:41:16.868 --> 05:41:16.878 align:start position:0%
that decision in front of a judge or
 
05:41:19.110 --> 05:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
judges on the basis that the process or
 
05:41:20.990 --> 05:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
the outcome was wrong this is basic
 
05:41:22.788 --> 05:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
checks and balances and we trust the
 
05:41:24.190 --> 05:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
public servants and defer to their
 
05:41:26.468 --> 05:41:26.478 align:start position:0%
wisdom but we need courts to set things
 
05:41:28.030 --> 05:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
right if mistakes are made or bad
 
05:41:30.670 --> 05:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
judgment prevails
 
05:41:34.350 --> 05:41:34.360 align:start position:0%
in 36 US states and the federal system
 
05:41:35.948 --> 05:41:35.958 align:start position:0%
for nearly 80 years since the
 
05:41:37.990 --> 05:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
administrative procedures act became law
 
05:41:38.000 --> 05:41:39.110 align:start position:0%
administrative procedures act became law
in

05:41:39.110 --> 05:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:41:41.868 --> 05:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
1946 that is exactly how it works there
 
05:41:43.590 --> 05:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
is fairness and checks and
 
05:41:46.510 --> 05:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
balances 36 states have a provision that
 
05:41:49.070 --> 05:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
the agency decision shall be reversed if
 
05:41:51.390 --> 05:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
it is found to be arbitrary or
 
05:41:54.788 --> 05:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
capricious New Hampshire does not we are
 
05:41:56.910 --> 05:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
one of the 14 states where it is very
 
05:41:59.628 --> 05:41:59.638 align:start position:0%
difficult for a citizen or a company to
 
05:42:01.430 --> 05:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
get a full judicial hearing about the
 
05:42:03.670 --> 05:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
merits of a regulatory or permitting
 
05:42:06.390 --> 05:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
decision in our state we have boards and
 
05:42:08.788 --> 05:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
councils for permits and a superior
 
05:42:10.708 --> 05:42:10.718 align:start position:0%
court for rules to hear initial
 
05:42:12.948 --> 05:42:12.958 align:start position:0%
challenges but they are only told to
 
05:42:16.350 --> 05:42:16.360 align:start position:0%
consider whether the agent agency acted
 
05:42:19.548 --> 05:42:19.558 align:start position:0%
clearly unlawfully or unreasonably that
 
05:42:23.590 --> 05:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
is our standard of review and our rules
 
05:42:26.430 --> 05:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
require the Challenger to prove so via a
 
05:42:29.150 --> 05:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence standard
 
05:42:31.350 --> 05:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
at the next and final level the thumb on
 
05:42:33.110 --> 05:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
the scale gets even heavier as the
 
05:42:35.270 --> 05:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
higher court is instructed by Statute to
 
05:42:37.948 --> 05:42:37.958 align:start position:0%
assume that the prior decision was
 
05:42:40.548 --> 05:42:40.558 align:start position:0%
correct unless the Challenger can prove
 
05:42:43.788 --> 05:42:43.798 align:start position:0%
by a clear preponderance of the evidence
 
05:42:47.070 --> 05:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
that the agency was not correct this is
 
05:42:48.628 --> 05:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
not merely a general tilting of the
 
05:42:50.670 --> 05:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
scales towards the agency but it makes
 
05:42:52.310 --> 05:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
the whole system into a verdict on
 
05:42:54.430 --> 05:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
whether what the agency actually did was
 
05:42:57.030 --> 05:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
legal and checked all the boxes rather
 
05:42:58.670 --> 05:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
than what the citizens and companies
 
05:43:00.548 --> 05:43:00.558 align:start position:0%
appealing that decision to serve a
 
05:43:02.310 --> 05:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
discussion on whether what the agency
 
05:43:04.830 --> 05:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
did was right sensible grounded in
 
05:43:06.510 --> 05:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
evidence and fairly balanced competing
 
05:43:08.670 --> 05:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
rights and Liberties these discussions
 
05:43:10.430 --> 05:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
cannot happen in a state without a
 
05:43:12.628 --> 05:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
modern system for judicial Ru review of
 
05:43:15.510 --> 05:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
agency action so this bill changes to
 
05:43:17.590 --> 05:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
rsas one for the appeals of Permitting
 
05:43:21.590 --> 05:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
decisions and one for um AR arguing
 
05:43:23.070 --> 05:43:23.080 align:start position:0%
whether an agency decision has been
 
05:43:25.350 --> 05:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
arbitrary or capricious so there are two
 
05:43:26.670 --> 05:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
key words that Chang at the federal
 
05:43:29.110 --> 05:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
system in 1946 and this bill proposes
 
05:43:32.708 --> 05:43:32.718 align:start position:0%
doing the same for our state uh to join
 
05:43:36.150 --> 05:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
the well to be one less so we'd be 13
 
05:43:39.070 --> 05:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
not including us um one less of the
 
05:43:40.868 --> 05:43:40.878 align:start position:0%
states that haven't quite caught on to
 
05:43:43.310 --> 05:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
the new legal standard so this bill in
 
05:43:45.190 --> 05:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
no way prejudices whether or not or how
 
05:43:46.830 --> 05:43:46.840 align:start position:0%
often an appeal on either side would be
 
05:43:48.788 --> 05:43:48.798 align:start position:0%
successful it doesn't encourage more
 
05:43:50.590 --> 05:43:50.600 align:start position:0%
litigation it only says that as long as
 
05:43:52.270 --> 05:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
the parties both sides of the conflict
 
05:43:54.350 --> 05:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
are in court anyway they deserve to be
 
05:43:56.110 --> 05:43:56.120 align:start position:0%
heard on the merits and not just have
 
05:43:57.910 --> 05:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
the agency always assumed be right from
 
05:43:59.868 --> 05:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
the beginning
 
05:44:01.628 --> 05:44:01.638 align:start position:0%
a word on the concern that changing the
 
05:44:03.708 --> 05:44:03.718 align:start position:0%
standard of judicial review may increase
 
05:44:05.788 --> 05:44:05.798 align:start position:0%
litigation um I would say I am an
 
05:44:07.990 --> 05:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
attorney um and parties choose to appeal
 
05:44:10.390 --> 05:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
for many reasons some strategic some
 
05:44:12.510 --> 05:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
emotional but appeals on agency and
 
05:44:14.990 --> 05:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
Lower Court decisions will always occur
 
05:44:16.430 --> 05:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
this bill just changes the way that the
 
05:44:18.270 --> 05:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
court considers the arguments from both
 
05:44:20.750 --> 05:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
sides and I would say that Dees should
 
05:44:23.230 --> 05:44:23.240 align:start position:0%
welcome being added to the 36 we could
 
05:44:25.830 --> 05:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
be number 37 US states that have some
 
05:44:27.788 --> 05:44:27.798 align:start position:0%
form of arbitrary and capricious review
 
05:44:29.788 --> 05:44:29.798 align:start position:0%
of their decisions uh because it's nice
 
05:44:31.468 --> 05:44:31.478 align:start position:0%
to have a court system that is told to
 
05:44:33.190 --> 05:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
defer to your decision almost all the
 
05:44:35.150 --> 05:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
time but wouldn't it be better to have
 
05:44:36.628 --> 05:44:36.638 align:start position:0%
your decision upheld in court when you
 
05:44:38.910 --> 05:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
were told that you actually got it right
 
05:44:40.948 --> 05:44:40.958 align:start position:0%
so consider this bill a pilot to begin
 
05:44:41.990 --> 05:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
applying the standards of the
 
05:44:44.270 --> 05:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
administrative procedures act and apply
 
05:44:46.548 --> 05:44:46.558 align:start position:0%
a broader arbit arbitrary and capricious
 
05:44:48.548 --> 05:44:48.558 align:start position:0%
standard of review to one New Hampshire
 
05:44:51.110 --> 05:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
agency Dees not because we have any
 
05:44:53.430 --> 05:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
special or exclusive concern about Dees
 
05:44:54.910 --> 05:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
uh but because piloting this change at
 
05:44:57.350 --> 05:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
one agency will allow the state to gauge
 
05:44:58.990 --> 05:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
whether it should be expanded to other a
 
05:45:02.110 --> 05:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
agencies in addition Dees decisions tend
 
05:45:04.670 --> 05:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
to involve controversial interpretations
 
05:45:07.310 --> 05:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
of Science and economics the current
 
05:45:08.468 --> 05:45:08.478 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire only allows
 
05:45:10.510 --> 05:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
courts to correct errors when most of
 
05:45:12.590 --> 05:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
the concerns about DS decisions involve
 
05:45:14.990 --> 05:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
judgments based on facts and data that
 
05:45:16.750 --> 05:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
may not be erroneous but may be poorly
 
05:45:18.910 --> 05:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
reasoned so let's set the stage with a
 
05:45:21.110 --> 05:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
real life example New Hampshire has a
 
05:45:23.270 --> 05:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
waste management Council as a quasi
 
05:45:25.750 --> 05:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
court for the first appeal of de's
 
05:45:27.948 --> 05:45:27.958 align:start position:0%
decisions these volunteer positions are
 
05:45:29.310 --> 05:45:29.320 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor and the
 
05:45:31.670 --> 05:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
executive counsel and there are often
 
05:45:35.270 --> 05:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
vacancies currently out of 13 appointees
 
05:45:37.270 --> 05:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
five slots including the chair are
 
05:45:39.548 --> 05:45:39.558 align:start position:0%
vacant also note that among the
 
05:45:41.708 --> 05:45:41.718 align:start position:0%
vacancies are slots for a public health
 
05:45:44.750 --> 05:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
expert a municipal official an elected
 
05:45:47.468 --> 05:45:47.478 align:start position:0%
official so the filled slots tend to
 
05:45:51.270 --> 05:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
skew to Industry heavy opinions this
 
05:45:52.590 --> 05:45:52.600 align:start position:0%
means that the New Hampshire Supreme
 
05:45:54.350 --> 05:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
Court is instructed to treat the
 
05:45:56.548 --> 05:45:56.558 align:start position:0%
decisions of this eight out of 13 member
 
05:45:59.190 --> 05:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
group as correct on face value as their
 
05:46:02.030 --> 05:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
standard of review agency Council
 
05:46:04.150 --> 05:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
decisions should certainly be respected
 
05:46:06.948 --> 05:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
but not assumed to be correct and nearly
 
05:46:09.948 --> 05:46:09.958 align:start position:0%
impossible to scrutinize the second step
 
05:46:11.990 --> 05:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
in an agency appeal is the New Hampshire
 
05:46:14.190 --> 05:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court in a recent New Hampshire
 
05:46:16.910 --> 05:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision appeal of Dees
 
05:46:18.788 --> 05:46:18.798 align:start position:0%
and North Country Environmental Services
 
05:46:22.948 --> 05:46:22.958 align:start position:0%
Inc which is argued on October 2nd 2023
 
05:46:24.468 --> 05:46:24.478 align:start position:0%
the issue on appeal was that the waste
 
05:46:27.070 --> 05:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
management Council the first Arbiter
 
05:46:28.628 --> 05:46:28.638 align:start position:0%
ruled that it didn't matter that there
 
05:46:31.070 --> 05:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
was was a broad scientific consensus
 
05:46:34.548 --> 05:46:34.558 align:start position:0%
that testing for past chemicals should
 
05:46:37.070 --> 05:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
be part of any landfill permit but there
 
05:46:41.190 --> 05:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
was as yet no legal requirement for this
 
05:46:43.270 --> 05:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
under current law any further
 
05:46:44.990 --> 05:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
challenging Court would have to begin
 
05:46:47.270 --> 05:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
from the premise that the council's
 
05:46:50.030 --> 05:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
decision was correct if this bill is
 
05:46:51.750 --> 05:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
enacted the reviewing Court would at
 
05:46:53.910 --> 05:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
least be able to hear arguments about
 
05:46:55.590 --> 05:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
the science and the wisdom of not
 
05:46:57.948 --> 05:46:57.958 align:start position:0%
testing for pasas a fairly new
 
05:46:59.468 --> 05:46:59.478 align:start position:0%
Environmental cabinet which we are
 
05:47:01.150 --> 05:47:01.160 align:start position:0%
learning about and responding to in our
 
05:47:03.230 --> 05:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
state but new information continues to
 
05:47:04.110 --> 05:47:04.120 align:start position:0%
come to
 
05:47:06.270 --> 05:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
light adopting and updated
 
05:47:07.910 --> 05:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
administrative procedures act standard
 
05:47:10.670 --> 05:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
of review allows an appeal on the merits
 
05:47:12.350 --> 05:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
where one side of the controversy or the
 
05:47:14.390 --> 05:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
other has felt unheard and should be
 
05:47:16.270 --> 05:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
able to argue their case based upon
 
05:47:19.310 --> 05:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
science economics policy or logic of a
 
05:47:22.190 --> 05:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
ruler permit arbitrary in capre review
 
05:47:23.910 --> 05:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
has worked well for the FED in these 36
 
05:47:26.150 --> 05:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
dates for decades because it does not
 
05:47:27.750 --> 05:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
entail judges substituting their
 
05:47:30.070 --> 05:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
judgment for that of AG agency experts
 
05:47:31.830 --> 05:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
it simply lets them hear arguments from
 
05:47:33.670 --> 05:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
the most affected citizens and that
 
05:47:35.990 --> 05:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
agency may have been irrational
 
05:47:38.230 --> 05:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
inconsistent myopic or dismissive of
 
05:47:40.310 --> 05:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
their respective comments more and more
 
05:47:42.190 --> 05:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
as years go by Dees and other agencies
 
05:47:43.750 --> 05:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
make decisions at the frontiers of
 
05:47:45.788 --> 05:47:45.798 align:start position:0%
knowledge and policy to say that no
 
05:47:47.468 --> 05:47:47.478 align:start position:0%
council or Court can hear complaints
 
05:47:49.310 --> 05:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
about how the agency received and
 
05:47:51.150 --> 05:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
interpreted factual information is just
 
05:47:53.548 --> 05:47:53.558 align:start position:0%
not a sufficient standard of review
 
05:47:56.628 --> 05:47:56.638 align:start position:0%
anymore so in summary House Bill 1614
 
05:47:58.230 --> 05:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
responds to two very different but
 
05:48:00.190 --> 05:48:00.200 align:start position:0%
compliment strains in American and New
 
05:48:02.350 --> 05:48:02.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire politics in one sense it
 
05:48:04.670 --> 05:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
tracks through a much less radical way
 
05:48:06.468 --> 05:48:06.478 align:start position:0%
the recent Movement by the United States
 
05:48:08.350 --> 05:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to reduce the automatic
 
05:48:10.150 --> 05:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
deference that courts have been given on
 
05:48:12.750 --> 05:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
elected agency officials the bill stands
 
05:48:14.190 --> 05:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
for the principle that the courts have a
 
05:48:15.868 --> 05:48:15.878 align:start position:0%
greater role to play an overseeing
 
05:48:18.190 --> 05:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
agency activity but this bill also
 
05:48:20.110 --> 05:48:20.120 align:start position:0%
tracks the Nationwide appreciation that
 
05:48:22.788 --> 05:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
in the information age stakeholders have
 
05:48:24.270 --> 05:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
important knowledge and perspectives to
 
05:48:26.468 --> 05:48:26.478 align:start position:0%
impart in rulemaking and adjudication
 
05:48:27.830 --> 05:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
and deserve a meaningful Forum to
 
05:48:30.110 --> 05:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
challenge decision that arguably were
 
05:48:32.948 --> 05:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
biased narrow or simply unwise when an
 
05:48:35.190 --> 05:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
agency regulates strictly or weakly or
 
05:48:36.910 --> 05:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
when it grants a permit or denies one
 
05:48:38.948 --> 05:48:38.958 align:start position:0%
its decision should be made final and be
 
05:48:41.468 --> 05:48:41.478 align:start position:0%
respected not because we said so and
 
05:48:43.548 --> 05:48:43.558 align:start position:0%
that is why but because affected parties
 
05:48:45.628 --> 05:48:45.638 align:start position:0%
have had a fair chance to challenge or
 
05:48:47.948 --> 05:48:47.958 align:start position:0%
improve that decision most of the rest
 
05:48:49.468 --> 05:48:49.478 align:start position:0%
of the nation found this balance between
 
05:48:50.910 --> 05:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
too much and too little discretion
 
05:48:52.868 --> 05:48:52.878 align:start position:0%
decades ago it's time for in Hampshire
 
05:48:54.868 --> 05:48:54.878 align:start position:0%
to join to allow courts to look for
 
05:48:56.948 --> 05:48:56.958 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and capricious agency action
 
05:48:58.830 --> 05:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
we should modernize the process of
 
05:49:01.030 --> 05:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
review and pass this bill and I'm happy
 
05:49:03.070 --> 05:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
to take questions questions for this
 
05:49:04.868 --> 05:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
witness representative Alexander thank
 
05:49:06.070 --> 05:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:49:07.948 --> 05:49:07.958 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
05:49:11.070 --> 05:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
I actually have two first one is I'd be
 
05:49:13.390 --> 05:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
um anxious to hear your opinion on the
 
05:49:14.548 --> 05:49:14.558 align:start position:0%
next public hearing that we're going to
 
05:49:16.468 --> 05:49:16.478 align:start position:0%
have it um so if you'd stick around for
 
05:49:18.110 --> 05:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
that that would be great and then number
 
05:49:21.948 --> 05:49:21.958 align:start position:0%
two is um have you found the 36 other
 
05:49:24.190 --> 05:49:24.200 align:start position:0%
states that have enacted something like
 
05:49:26.750 --> 05:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
this have either lost Federal funding if
 
05:49:30.430 --> 05:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
a Court's overruled um a department
 
05:49:33.548 --> 05:49:33.558 align:start position:0%
decision or have you found that the the
 
05:49:35.868 --> 05:49:35.878 align:start position:0%
federal agencies that award money or in
 
05:49:38.788 --> 05:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
any way have continue to give them money
 
05:49:40.430 --> 05:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
even if the decision's been overruled by
 
05:49:43.030 --> 05:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
a Judicial Authority thank you very much
 
05:49:45.310 --> 05:49:45.320 align:start position:0%
for the question um I'd be happy to to
 
05:49:47.110 --> 05:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
stick around afterwards that's not a
 
05:49:49.350 --> 05:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
problem uh to the second question I
 
05:49:51.150 --> 05:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
don't have any information about federal
 
05:49:52.788 --> 05:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
funds being rescinded that's not to say
 
05:49:54.150 --> 05:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
that they haven't been I just don't have
 
05:49:57.628 --> 05:49:57.638 align:start position:0%
information on that um but to just to
 
05:50:00.190 --> 05:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
you know put a note on it the federal
 
05:50:02.270 --> 05:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
standard review is the same as those 36
 
05:50:03.990 --> 05:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
States so it is the arbitrary and
 
05:50:05.468 --> 05:50:05.478 align:start position:0%
capricious standard review we're one of
 
05:50:07.110 --> 05:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
the states who hasn't adopted that but
 
05:50:08.468 --> 05:50:08.478 align:start position:0%
in terms of funding I just don't have
 
05:50:10.270 --> 05:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
the information if something's been
 
05:50:12.788 --> 05:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
pulled I don't know it okay so if I
 
05:50:14.788 --> 05:50:14.798 align:start position:0%
could so are you saying this the New
 
05:50:17.430 --> 05:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire standard is higher and that if
 
05:50:18.910 --> 05:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
we lower it to this standard it'll still
 
05:50:21.350 --> 05:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
be in line with the federal standard uh
 
05:50:23.510 --> 05:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
I think our standard is actually a
 
05:50:26.628 --> 05:50:26.638 align:start position:0%
little bit more differential it's not a
 
05:50:29.670 --> 05:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
higher or lower it is a
 
05:50:33.270 --> 05:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
we defer to the agency's decision we
 
05:50:35.708 --> 05:50:35.718 align:start position:0%
refer to the waste management council's
 
05:50:38.390 --> 05:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
decision and so therefore we don't
 
05:50:39.910 --> 05:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
discuss any of the things that could
 
05:50:42.030 --> 05:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
have gone wrong in those two reviews
 
05:50:43.990 --> 05:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
when we get to the New Hampshire Supreme
 
05:50:46.310 --> 05:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
Court it's just the way that we've done
 
05:50:48.910 --> 05:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
that historically and and just to say
 
05:50:50.788 --> 05:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
that um with the administrative
 
05:50:52.788 --> 05:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
procedures act there has been an
 
05:50:54.310 --> 05:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
evolution in some of the states that
 
05:50:56.310 --> 05:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
have been updating their laws to try to
 
05:50:58.750 --> 05:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
stay closer to fairness and I would say
 
05:51:00.830 --> 05:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
that we're kind of hanging back with the
 
05:51:02.910 --> 05:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
other 13 states that haven't really
 
05:51:05.510 --> 05:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
changed to try to find Transparency and
 
05:51:08.110 --> 05:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
fairness on both sides you're welcome
 
05:51:08.120 --> 05:51:11.548 align:start position:0%
fairness on both sides you're welcome
represent

05:51:11.548 --> 05:51:11.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:13.830 --> 05:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
Andrew thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:51:17.468 --> 05:51:17.478 align:start position:0%
for taking my question is there data
 
05:51:22.150 --> 05:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
available as to how many decisions Dees
 
05:51:25.270 --> 05:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
makes a year and how many of those
 
05:51:29.150 --> 05:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
decisions The public's not happy with
 
05:51:31.510 --> 05:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
you know I think it's possible to get
 
05:51:35.628 --> 05:51:35.638 align:start position:0%
there um I can ask around I think we
 
05:51:37.590 --> 05:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
don't have that many uh Supreme Court
 
05:51:39.510 --> 05:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
decisions if you're looking for that so
 
05:51:41.548 --> 05:51:41.558 align:start position:0%
it would be a fairly easy review to get
 
05:51:43.708 --> 05:51:43.718 align:start position:0%
you know the last five years of Dees
 
05:51:45.230 --> 05:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
decisions that made it to the Supreme
 
05:51:48.510 --> 05:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
Court and you know how it went uh but
 
05:51:50.468 --> 05:51:50.478 align:start position:0%
big picture once again I want to say
 
05:51:52.948 --> 05:51:52.958 align:start position:0%
that the intention is to start with Dees
 
05:51:54.270 --> 05:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
because they tend to have more
 
05:51:56.628 --> 05:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
scientific and technologically related
 
05:51:59.070 --> 05:51:59.080 align:start position:0%
appeals um but I do think the intent
 
05:52:01.670 --> 05:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
would be to Pilot this and slowly move
 
05:52:03.788 --> 05:52:03.798 align:start position:0%
our way if this is successful to
 
05:52:05.510 --> 05:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
updating the administrative procedures
 
05:52:08.750 --> 05:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
act for all agencies in New
 
05:52:10.750 --> 05:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire other questions for this
 
05:52:13.270 --> 05:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
witness so I guess I do have a couple I
 
05:52:16.590 --> 05:52:16.600 align:start position:0%
guess I have two in particular um I'm
 
05:52:19.030 --> 05:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
not quite sure I mean I there's no
 
05:52:21.910 --> 05:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
question that the the words used are
 
05:52:24.830 --> 05:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
different but I'm not quite sure that I
 
05:52:26.628 --> 05:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
understand what is the difference
 
05:52:29.110 --> 05:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
between the current current standard
 
05:52:32.390 --> 05:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
which as I understand it is that uh uh
 
05:52:35.230 --> 05:52:35.240 align:start position:0%
the agency action can be set aside under
 
05:52:38.548 --> 05:52:38.558 align:start position:0%
current law if it's clearly unreasonable
 
05:52:40.190 --> 05:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
clearly unlawful or
 
05:52:42.110 --> 05:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
unreasonable what's the difference
 
05:52:44.590 --> 05:52:44.600 align:start position:0%
between that and arbitrary and
 
05:52:46.910 --> 05:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
capricious why you you seem to say that
 
05:52:49.830 --> 05:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
one is different than the other but I'm
 
05:52:52.750 --> 05:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
not sure I that I see how they are
 
05:52:55.350 --> 05:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
different from each other uh so clearly
 
05:52:57.150 --> 05:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
unlawful and unreasonable the current
 
05:53:01.390 --> 05:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
standard um requires some kind of proof
 
05:53:03.548 --> 05:53:03.558 align:start position:0%
by the petitioner which would be in this
 
05:53:05.708 --> 05:53:05.718 align:start position:0%
case the the party bringing the appeal
 
05:53:07.310 --> 05:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
right so they would have to prove that
 
05:53:09.390 --> 05:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
there it was clearly so there would need
 
05:53:11.270 --> 05:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
to be significant preponderance of the
 
05:53:14.110 --> 05:53:14.120 align:start position:0%
evidence to get to clearly as opposed to
 
05:53:16.468 --> 05:53:16.478 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and capricious where if you're
 
05:53:18.788 --> 05:53:18.798 align:start position:0%
trying to prove arbitrary you have a
 
05:53:20.948 --> 05:53:20.958 align:start position:0%
lesser standard of evidence to get to
 
05:53:22.390 --> 05:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and
 
05:53:24.788 --> 05:53:24.798 align:start position:0%
certainly so something is something can
 
05:53:29.310 --> 05:53:29.320 align:start position:0%
be arbitrary without being clearly wrong
 
05:53:31.230 --> 05:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
I I would say that yeah you can be
 
05:53:32.750 --> 05:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
arbitrary you can look like you're
 
05:53:34.830 --> 05:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
swinging left swinging right things are
 
05:53:36.110 --> 05:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
coming out of the woodwork it's a
 
05:53:38.628 --> 05:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
strange decision it could be arbitrary
 
05:53:41.750 --> 05:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
without being clearly inaccurate or
 
05:53:44.430 --> 05:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
wrong okay all right second question I
 
05:53:48.150 --> 05:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
have is uh on page two that's in the
 
05:53:48.160 --> 05:53:50.270 align:start position:0%
have is uh on page two that's in the
subsection

05:53:50.270 --> 05:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
subsection
 
05:53:54.510 --> 05:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
2E you say the order uh you you it says
 
05:53:56.110 --> 05:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
the order is not supported by evidence
 
05:53:57.628 --> 05:53:57.638 align:start position:0%
that is substantial when viewed in the
 
05:53:59.110 --> 05:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
light of the whole record before the
 
05:54:01.628 --> 05:54:01.638 align:start position:0%
court which includes the agency record
 
05:54:05.070 --> 05:54:05.080 align:start position:0%
for judicial review supplemented by any
 
05:54:06.750 --> 05:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
additional evidence received by the
 
05:54:09.190 --> 05:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
court under this chapter so I guess my
 
05:54:11.868 --> 05:54:11.878 align:start position:0%
question is is does this mean that the
 
05:54:14.830 --> 05:54:14.840 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court will now begin accepting
 
05:54:17.910 --> 05:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
evidence on
 
05:54:20.350 --> 05:54:20.360 align:start position:0%
appeals new
 
05:54:22.510 --> 05:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
evidence let me just go back to that one
 
05:54:22.520 --> 05:54:27.070 align:start position:0%
evidence let me just go back to that one
more

05:54:27.070 --> 05:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:27.080 --> 05:54:43.390 align:start position:0%
 
time

05:54:43.390 --> 05:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:44.990 --> 05:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
I think the intent here is not to
 
05:54:47.990 --> 05:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
relitigate the case I think the intent
 
05:54:49.990 --> 05:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
here is to look at all of the pieces
 
05:54:51.628 --> 05:54:51.638 align:start position:0%
that were presented and see whether
 
05:54:53.708 --> 05:54:53.718 align:start position:0%
there was a mistake or it was
 
05:54:56.150 --> 05:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
interpreted improperly right but what
 
05:54:58.110 --> 05:54:58.120 align:start position:0%
about the supplemented by any additional
 
05:55:00.190 --> 05:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
evidence that clearly suggests that the
 
05:55:03.390 --> 05:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court can consider new evidence
 
05:55:04.590 --> 05:55:04.600 align:start position:0%
and that's I guess that's what I'm
 
05:55:06.990 --> 05:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
troubled by that would be unprecedented
 
05:55:09.708 --> 05:55:09.718 align:start position:0%
I think so in the case that we're using
 
05:55:12.910 --> 05:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
as an example here the P situation
 
05:55:14.430 --> 05:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
supplemented by additional evidence
 
05:55:15.868 --> 05:55:15.878 align:start position:0%
would include more information that's
 
05:55:17.910 --> 05:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
come out about pasas in the time since
 
05:55:20.788 --> 05:55:20.798 align:start position:0%
the case initially started um so it's
 
05:55:23.788 --> 05:55:23.798 align:start position:0%
been several years we know more about P
 
05:55:26.990 --> 05:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
today than we did two years ago right so
 
05:55:28.510 --> 05:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
if we have additional information
 
05:55:30.150 --> 05:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
based on the the data that we're
 
05:55:31.910 --> 05:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
learning about pasas its impacts on
 
05:55:33.910 --> 05:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
human health and how it spreads through
 
05:55:36.830 --> 05:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
um underground water systems Etc then
 
05:55:38.230 --> 05:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
that evidence should be allowed to be
 
05:55:40.230 --> 05:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
shown to the superior court or Supreme
 
05:55:41.750 --> 05:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
Court sorry that evidence should be
 
05:55:43.510 --> 05:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to be shown because it's new in
 
05:55:46.110 --> 05:55:46.120 align:start position:0%
that the Innovation and the information
 
05:55:48.350 --> 05:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
has changed right there's new evidence
 
05:55:51.948 --> 05:55:51.958 align:start position:0%
about the insidiousness of pasas so that
 
05:55:54.830 --> 05:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be uh preempted from
 
05:55:56.750 --> 05:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
presentation okay and does the other
 
05:55:58.430 --> 05:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
side then if there if there if if
 
05:56:00.230 --> 05:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
there's some contrary information to
 
05:56:02.030 --> 05:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
that or does the other side get to
 
05:56:03.430 --> 05:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
present that too and right it's
 
05:56:04.948 --> 05:56:04.958 align:start position:0%
supplement and does the Supreme Court
 
05:56:07.750 --> 05:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
then decide which is right they get to
 
05:56:11.030 --> 05:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
decide factually which one is right so
 
05:56:13.590 --> 05:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
that that is the underlying issue of
 
05:56:15.868 --> 05:56:15.878 align:start position:0%
some of these Dees decisions and agency
 
05:56:18.230 --> 05:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
decisions across the board is it may be
 
05:56:22.590 --> 05:56:22.600 align:start position:0%
based on a rule that is out of date and
 
05:56:24.468 --> 05:56:24.478 align:start position:0%
Time Marches On and we learn more
 
05:56:27.070 --> 05:56:27.080 align:start position:0%
information about P right and the way
 
05:56:28.548 --> 05:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
that Pas spreads through underground
 
05:56:31.150 --> 05:56:31.160 align:start position:0%
water and so that information absolutely
 
05:56:33.430 --> 05:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
should be applied but there's no
 
05:56:35.548 --> 05:56:35.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity between the beginning of the
 
05:56:37.310 --> 05:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
appeal where you in front of the waste
 
05:56:38.868 --> 05:56:38.878 align:start position:0%
management Council and then when you
 
05:56:41.310 --> 05:56:41.320 align:start position:0%
finally get to the the Supreme Court
 
05:56:42.948 --> 05:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
there's really no opportunity to bring
 
05:56:45.510 --> 05:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
that additional information forward so
 
05:56:47.390 --> 05:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
because it's Cutting Edge you would have
 
05:56:49.830 --> 05:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
to start all over again but you would be
 
05:56:51.990 --> 05:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
precluded from appealing any further
 
05:56:53.230 --> 05:56:53.240 align:start position:0%
because you've exhausted all your
 
05:56:54.868 --> 05:56:54.878 align:start position:0%
appeals do you understand you're sort of
 
05:56:56.868 --> 05:56:56.878 align:start position:0%
in this Catch 22 where you want to talk
 
05:56:58.670 --> 05:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
more about what we've learned about P
 
05:57:00.990 --> 05:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
but you can't well you could I mean I
 
05:57:03.590 --> 05:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
suppose you could file a motion with the
 
05:57:05.270 --> 05:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court asking that the case be
 
05:57:09.070 --> 05:57:09.080 align:start position:0%
remanded to the to the uh the wetlands
 
05:57:12.070 --> 05:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
Council or the uh or even to the dees
 
05:57:14.390 --> 05:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
for a new information that might or
 
05:57:15.910 --> 05:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
might not be granted but you would have
 
05:57:17.750 --> 05:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
that opportunity wouldn't you to seek
 
05:57:17.760 --> 05:57:18.708 align:start position:0%
that opportunity wouldn't you to seek
that

05:57:18.708 --> 05:57:18.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:57:21.990 --> 05:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
relief technically yes but considering
 
05:57:24.270 --> 05:57:24.280 align:start position:0%
that Dees is kind of judg jury and
 
05:57:26.110 --> 05:57:26.120 align:start position:0%
executioner I don't think you'd have a
 
05:57:27.788 --> 05:57:27.798 align:start position:0%
friendly audience to go back to with
 
05:57:30.110 --> 05:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
with that additional information so the
 
05:57:32.350 --> 05:57:32.360 align:start position:0%
idea is to have the court as that sort
 
05:57:35.708 --> 05:57:35.718 align:start position:0%
of neutral third party to review as an
 
05:57:38.310 --> 05:57:38.320 align:start position:0%
additional outside party rather than
 
05:57:40.030 --> 05:57:40.040 align:start position:0%
trying to go back to Dees where you have
 
05:57:43.750 --> 05:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
already lost do you understand all right
 
05:57:46.150 --> 05:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness
 
05:57:49.110 --> 05:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
representative CH yeah thanks Mr chair
 
05:57:51.590 --> 05:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
and thanks for taking the question
 
05:57:53.750 --> 05:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
um I don't know there may be someone
 
05:57:55.110 --> 05:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
from Department of Justice that's going
 
05:57:57.150 --> 05:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
to testify I I'm looking and I usually
 
05:57:59.510 --> 05:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
don't go down into the the financial
 
05:58:02.030 --> 05:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal note too much there's a statement
 
05:58:05.310 --> 05:58:05.320 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note though that says uh
 
05:58:07.190 --> 05:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
that the bill is inconsistent with other
 
05:58:09.548 --> 05:58:09.558 align:start position:0%
provisions of Law and I won't read the
 
05:58:12.910 --> 05:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
whole section but essentially that the
 
05:58:18.150 --> 05:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
council's work is not um uh appealed to
 
05:58:20.270 --> 05:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court sections one and two
 
05:58:21.868 --> 05:58:21.878 align:start position:0%
of the bill presume the decisions of the
 
05:58:23.468 --> 05:58:23.478 align:start position:0%
department are heard at the Supreme
 
05:58:25.468 --> 05:58:25.478 align:start position:0%
Court and then sort of above it states
 
05:58:26.830 --> 05:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
that they're that they're not I'm
 
05:58:28.548 --> 05:58:28.558 align:start position:0%
looking at they they don't have line
 
05:58:30.310 --> 05:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
numbers but it's it's right at the split
 
05:58:33.230 --> 05:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
of the page in the in the fiscal note
 
05:58:36.030 --> 05:58:36.040 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't sure if you could that
 
05:58:38.190 --> 05:58:38.200 align:start position:0%
resonated with you or you had a a sense
 
05:58:40.590 --> 05:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
of what that that issue that's being
 
05:58:42.788 --> 05:58:42.798 align:start position:0%
raised there
 
05:58:47.628 --> 05:58:47.638 align:start position:0%
is sorry sure thank you for the question
 
05:58:49.670 --> 05:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
um so the Department of Justice
 
05:58:51.110 --> 05:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
represents Department of Environmental
 
05:58:53.070 --> 05:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
Services on most appeals to the councils
 
05:58:55.310 --> 05:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
would represent DS in a declar judgement
 
05:58:57.468 --> 05:58:57.478 align:start position:0%
declaratory judgment action in Superior
 
05:58:59.628 --> 05:58:59.638 align:start position:0%
Court Court department refers to the
 
05:59:00.990 --> 05:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice for information
 
05:59:02.548 --> 05:59:02.558 align:start position:0%
regarding fisical impact and then it
 
05:59:04.948 --> 05:59:04.958 align:start position:0%
goes on to say it's not possible to
 
05:59:06.430 --> 05:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
estimate whether there would be more
 
05:59:10.788 --> 05:59:10.798 align:start position:0%
appeals or more litigation um so I guess
 
05:59:13.310 --> 05:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
the the challenge here is really what
 
05:59:15.910 --> 05:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
does this change in terms of cost for
 
05:59:19.110 --> 05:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and and it's I I
 
05:59:20.628 --> 05:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
would I would say there's very little
 
05:59:23.070 --> 05:59:23.080 align:start position:0%
change because people appeal for lots of
 
05:59:24.628 --> 05:59:24.638 align:start position:0%
reasons and they're going to appeal
 
05:59:26.310 --> 05:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's a different
 
05:59:27.910 --> 05:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
standard there's just going to appeal
 
05:59:29.830 --> 05:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
because they've decided that's either
 
05:59:32.468 --> 05:59:32.478 align:start position:0%
emotional or logical for the next step
 
05:59:34.270 --> 05:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
with their
 
05:59:37.270 --> 05:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
claim other questions for this witness
 
05:59:38.948 --> 05:59:38.958 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much man
 
05:59:40.628 --> 05:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
you're very welcome next I'm going to
 
05:59:56.548 --> 05:59:56.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:56.558 --> 06:00:06.190 align:start position:0%
 
please

06:00:06.190 --> 06:00:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:07.868 --> 06:00:07.878 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman members of the
 
06:00:09.750 --> 06:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Adam kpo I'm the
 
06:00:11.070 --> 06:00:11.080 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner at the Department
 
06:00:13.788 --> 06:00:13.798 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services I'll give a
 
06:00:14.948 --> 06:00:14.958 align:start position:0%
brief overview of the letter of
 
06:00:18.230 --> 06:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
testimony we submitted um but before uh
 
06:00:19.430 --> 06:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
before I get to the reasons why we're
 
06:00:21.190 --> 06:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill let me explain how
 
06:00:24.310 --> 06:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
the appeals uh of departmental decisions
 
06:00:26.750 --> 06:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
happen now currently decisions that are
 
06:00:29.430 --> 06:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
appealed at dees are heard by one of our
 
06:00:31.430 --> 06:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
four environmental councils the waste
 
06:00:33.868 --> 06:00:33.878 align:start position:0%
management Council air Resources Council
 
06:00:36.030 --> 06:00:36.040 align:start position:0%
Wetlands Council or water
 
06:00:38.468 --> 06:00:38.478 align:start position:0%
Council um these councils are separate
 
06:00:40.590 --> 06:00:40.600 align:start position:0%
and distinct from the department and
 
06:00:42.230 --> 06:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
their own and have their own legal
 
06:00:45.310 --> 06:00:45.320 align:start position:0%
council at doj the councils are supposed
 
06:00:47.310 --> 06:00:47.320 align:start position:0%
to ensure all decisions are lawful under
 
06:00:49.990 --> 06:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
our statutes and rules when a decision
 
06:00:51.548 --> 06:00:51.558 align:start position:0%
by the council is appealed it is heard
 
06:00:53.070 --> 06:00:53.080 align:start position:0%
by the Supreme Court for the
 
06:00:54.990 --> 06:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
consideration that's the opportunity
 
06:00:57.990 --> 06:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
that folks have to appeal now
 
06:00:59.510 --> 06:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
now let me get to some of the issu uh
 
06:01:01.868 --> 06:01:01.878 align:start position:0%
some of the issues we have with the bill
 
06:01:03.910 --> 06:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
sections one and two of the bill create
 
06:01:05.868 --> 06:01:05.878 align:start position:0%
unique standards of review for
 
06:01:08.310 --> 06:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
departmental decisions and also creates
 
06:01:10.468 --> 06:01:10.478 align:start position:0%
an entirely new cause of actions uh
 
06:01:11.948 --> 06:01:11.958 align:start position:0%
cause of action for parties who believe
 
06:01:14.430 --> 06:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
their rights have been violated it also
 
06:01:16.708 --> 06:01:16.718 align:start position:0%
assumes that the department uh decisions
 
06:01:18.350 --> 06:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
are appealed directly to the Supreme
 
06:01:20.430 --> 06:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
Court um I didn't see anything in there
 
06:01:22.150 --> 06:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
about the councils and as I just
 
06:01:24.990 --> 06:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
explained to you um there's a process
 
06:01:28.270 --> 06:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
currently in place and so it's unclear
 
06:01:30.230 --> 06:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
to us whether or not that would overlay
 
06:01:31.868 --> 06:01:31.878 align:start position:0%
on that process or if it would be a
 
06:01:35.468 --> 06:01:35.478 align:start position:0%
separate appeals route um so I know
 
06:01:37.310 --> 06:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
someone from doj is here as well to talk
 
06:01:38.670 --> 06:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
about to potentially talk about that if
 
06:01:40.030 --> 06:01:40.040 align:start position:0%
you have questions
 
06:01:43.670 --> 06:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
there um this bill also creates new
 
06:01:46.788 --> 06:01:46.798 align:start position:0%
criteria for review of Dees decisions
 
06:01:48.708 --> 06:01:48.718 align:start position:0%
that depart uh significantly from the
 
06:01:50.788 --> 06:01:50.798 align:start position:0%
standards of of review applicable to
 
06:01:53.948 --> 06:01:53.958 align:start position:0%
decisions of all other state agencies so
 
06:01:58.708 --> 06:01:58.718 align:start position:0%
uh RSA 541 dictates how appeals are
 
06:02:01.670 --> 06:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
occur and this would as um the sponsor
 
06:02:04.030 --> 06:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
had mentioned it I think she she had
 
06:02:08.030 --> 06:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
called it a um you know a a pilot this
 
06:02:11.788 --> 06:02:11.798 align:start position:0%
would you know skirt separate us from
 
06:02:13.270 --> 06:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
the rest of the state agencies and how
 
06:02:14.948 --> 06:02:14.958 align:start position:0%
how appeals are are
 
06:02:17.590 --> 06:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
considered um under section two the
 
06:02:20.350 --> 06:02:20.360 align:start position:0%
courts must Grant relief if any one of
 
06:02:23.030 --> 06:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
no fewer than nine criteria are met we
 
06:02:26.270 --> 06:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
are not aware of any real justification
 
06:02:28.510 --> 06:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
at least to to date for this sweeping
 
06:02:30.628 --> 06:02:30.638 align:start position:0%
change to be applied only to the
 
06:02:32.430 --> 06:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
department or the environmental councils
 
06:02:34.110 --> 06:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
however it's intended to
 
06:02:37.230 --> 06:02:37.240 align:start position:0%
apply um in sections three and four of
 
06:02:40.670 --> 06:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
the bill um it proposes to amend RSA
 
06:02:44.230 --> 06:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
541a to provide uh Boutique standard for
 
06:02:46.030 --> 06:02:46.040 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court to use when making
 
06:02:48.750 --> 06:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
declaratory judgments on the validity or
 
06:02:51.510 --> 06:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
applic applicability of departmental
 
06:02:54.948 --> 06:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
rules um unlike the standard for all
 
06:02:56.708 --> 06:02:56.718 align:start position:0%
other state departments the proposed
 
06:02:58.310 --> 06:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
change in instructs the court to find a
 
06:03:00.430 --> 06:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
rule invalid if it finds that that it
 
06:03:02.548 --> 06:03:02.558 align:start position:0%
meets any one of the four criteria set
 
06:03:03.468 --> 06:03:03.478 align:start position:0%
out in the
 
06:03:06.270 --> 06:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
bill lastly uh the department opposes
 
06:03:08.310 --> 06:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
this bill because it proposes CH uh the
 
06:03:09.468 --> 06:03:09.478 align:start position:0%
proposed changes would create
 
06:03:11.510 --> 06:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
significant confusion over the
 
06:03:14.230 --> 06:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
applicable appeal procedures and would
 
06:03:16.310 --> 06:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
provide both regulated parties and any
 
06:03:18.110 --> 06:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
other potentially agreed parties with
 
06:03:20.350 --> 06:03:20.360 align:start position:0%
new and expanded opportunities to
 
06:03:22.150 --> 06:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
litigate Department decision and Rule
 
06:03:24.708 --> 06:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
decisions in Ru making we believe that
 
06:03:26.070 --> 06:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
the Bill's passage could lead to
 
06:03:27.788 --> 06:03:27.798 align:start position:0%
significant increases in the frequency
 
06:03:29.670 --> 06:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
of appeals and challenges to department
 
06:03:32.750 --> 06:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
rules that will needlessly impact the uh
 
06:03:34.190 --> 06:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
Department's resources and its
 
06:03:35.830 --> 06:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness in carrying out its
 
06:03:38.110 --> 06:03:38.120 align:start position:0%
Mission so thank you and I'm happy to
 
06:03:39.430 --> 06:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
take any
 
06:03:42.750 --> 06:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
questions questions yes represent excuse
 
06:03:44.750 --> 06:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
me representative Manos thank you Mr
 
06:03:47.750 --> 06:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
06:03:51.788 --> 06:03:51.798 align:start position:0%
how does um Dees currently take into
 
06:03:55.468 --> 06:03:55.478 align:start position:0%
account new scientific information new
 
06:03:58.230 --> 06:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
factual information new developments in
 
06:04:01.430 --> 06:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
the science sure sure So currently you
 
06:04:04.110 --> 06:04:04.120 align:start position:0%
know that to my understanding and excuse
 
06:04:06.030 --> 06:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
I'm Excuse Me I'm Only I've only been at
 
06:04:07.590 --> 06:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
the department for a month so I may have
 
06:04:09.190 --> 06:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
to I may have to write that question
 
06:04:11.190 --> 06:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
down but my my understanding right now
 
06:04:13.468 --> 06:04:13.478 align:start position:0%
is we would take that into account you
 
06:04:16.868 --> 06:04:16.878 align:start position:0%
know in our if we do new Ru making or if
 
06:04:19.628 --> 06:04:19.638 align:start position:0%
the legislature passes a new statute um
 
06:04:22.390 --> 06:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
I know um for our past standards those
 
06:04:24.548 --> 06:04:24.558 align:start position:0%
are set out those are drinking water
 
06:04:26.110 --> 06:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
standards those are set out actually in
 
06:04:27.788 --> 06:04:27.798 align:start position:0%
state statute
 
06:04:31.590 --> 06:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
um so typically that's how that would be
 
06:04:35.628 --> 06:04:35.638 align:start position:0%
done um separate from sort of appeals on
 
06:04:36.788 --> 06:04:36.798 align:start position:0%
on these
 
06:04:38.990 --> 06:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
decisions you have
 
06:04:41.670 --> 06:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
followup So within the course of an
 
06:04:44.230 --> 06:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
appeal from one of the counil from the
 
06:04:46.830 --> 06:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
agency to one of the councils and then
 
06:04:49.110 --> 06:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
potentially to the New Hampshire Supreme
 
06:04:52.150 --> 06:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
Court Dees doesn't have a procedure or
 
06:04:54.628 --> 06:04:54.638 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to weigh in on new
 
06:04:57.430 --> 06:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
scientific information or new fact ual
 
06:04:58.868 --> 06:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
information is that
 
06:05:02.430 --> 06:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
correct Alan do you want to step in on
 
06:05:05.110 --> 06:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
that one sure come on come on just just
 
06:05:06.510 --> 06:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
identify yourself with a record if you
 
06:05:06.520 --> 06:05:11.670 align:start position:0%
identify yourself with a record if you
would

06:05:11.670 --> 06:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:14.230 --> 06:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
please thank you my name is Alan Brooks
 
06:05:15.350 --> 06:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
I'm Chief in the Environmental
 
06:05:16.990 --> 06:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau Department of Justice
 
06:05:19.150 --> 06:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
I do have a card in as well we do not
 
06:05:21.350 --> 06:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
take a position on the bill I just be
 
06:05:23.110 --> 06:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
testifying for information but I'm happy
 
06:05:29.910 --> 06:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:31.350 --> 06:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
yes New Hampshire Department and
 
06:05:32.830 --> 06:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
technically I'm called an Assistant
 
06:05:32.840 --> 06:05:34.150 align:start position:0%
technically I'm called an Assistant
Attorney

06:05:34.150 --> 06:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
Attorney
 
06:05:36.350 --> 06:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
General so I believe the question was
 
06:05:40.548 --> 06:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:43.788 --> 06:05:43.798 align:start position:0%
information it depends on the program
 
06:05:46.030 --> 06:05:46.040 align:start position:0%
some programs I think operate with
 
06:05:47.910 --> 06:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
greater certainty Wetlands Etc a lot of
 
06:05:49.190 --> 06:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
that is Doc permitting structure
 
06:05:53.750 --> 06:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
permitting so the regulated Community
 
06:05:56.390 --> 06:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
usually wants finality and the agency
 
06:05:57.788 --> 06:05:57.798 align:start position:0%
does and there's not a lot of new
 
06:05:59.190 --> 06:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
information necessarily that comes up
 
06:06:01.468 --> 06:06:01.478 align:start position:0%
later other programs actually build into
 
06:06:03.030 --> 06:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
their permits sometimes the ability to
 
06:06:04.468 --> 06:06:04.478 align:start position:0%
look at new information and the
 
06:06:07.948 --> 06:06:07.958 align:start position:0%
requirement to um you know examine that
 
06:06:11.708 --> 06:06:11.718 align:start position:0%
so um waste is one of those uh they they
 
06:06:12.910 --> 06:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
have the ability at least to put
 
06:06:14.390 --> 06:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
conditions and permits for landfills to
 
06:06:15.670 --> 06:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
continue monitoring and look at
 
06:06:18.030 --> 06:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
different um you know aspects of it
 
06:06:19.310 --> 06:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
that's actually something that's built
 
06:06:21.670 --> 06:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
in various ways to enforcement programs
 
06:06:24.750 --> 06:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
as well for hazardous waste sites uh EPA
 
06:06:25.990 --> 06:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
has something similar that they do for
 
06:06:27.590 --> 06:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
superf fund sites
 
06:06:29.548 --> 06:06:29.558 align:start position:0%
but if the agency feels that it's
 
06:06:31.270 --> 06:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
necessary they should have the ability
 
06:06:34.670 --> 06:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
to condition an approval to allow for
 
06:06:36.628 --> 06:06:36.638 align:start position:0%
new information to come in and and to
 
06:06:38.830 --> 06:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
manage that
 
06:06:40.628 --> 06:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
situation yeah
 
06:06:43.868 --> 06:06:43.878 align:start position:0%
followup thank you but
 
06:06:47.230 --> 06:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
but within an appeal the state of the
 
06:06:47.240 --> 06:06:48.670 align:start position:0%
but within an appeal the state of the
scientific

06:06:48.670 --> 06:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
scientific
 
06:06:51.948 --> 06:06:51.958 align:start position:0%
information at the time of a decision
 
06:06:55.150 --> 06:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
the time a decision is made the in the
 
06:06:59.270 --> 06:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
scientific information is a b and c and
 
06:07:01.230 --> 06:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
then as you go through the Appellate
 
06:07:03.350 --> 06:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
process to one of the councils for
 
06:07:05.110 --> 06:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
example and then to the New Hampshire
 
06:07:08.468 --> 06:07:08.478 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court the scientific information
 
06:07:11.990 --> 06:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
can have changed so how within the
 
06:07:14.830 --> 06:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
course of an appeal how is the change in
 
06:07:17.868 --> 06:07:17.878 align:start position:0%
the science or factual information taken
 
06:07:17.878 --> 06:07:18.788 align:start position:0%
the science or factual information taken
into

06:07:18.788 --> 06:07:18.798 align:start position:0%
into
 
06:07:21.310 --> 06:07:21.320 align:start position:0%
account so I think if you as you've
 
06:07:22.868 --> 06:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
noted the first step of an appeal is to
 
06:07:25.390 --> 06:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
go to the council it used to be at least
 
06:07:26.990 --> 06:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
for some of the councils that Appeals
 
06:07:29.230 --> 06:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
were record-based appeals so basically
 
06:07:31.350 --> 06:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
the clock stopped when the record was
 
06:07:33.350 --> 06:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
completed Dees and so you didn't need to
 
06:07:35.070 --> 06:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
have witnesses and do something else you
 
06:07:36.788 --> 06:07:36.798 align:start position:0%
looked at the record that was changed
 
06:07:38.190 --> 06:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
there's actually a Supreme Court case on
 
06:07:40.350 --> 06:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
this that said it's now an evidentiary
 
06:07:41.868 --> 06:07:41.878 align:start position:0%
hearing so now the councils will
 
06:07:43.948 --> 06:07:43.958 align:start position:0%
actually allow new evidence to come in
 
06:07:46.830 --> 06:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
through Witnesses experts Etc during the
 
06:07:49.070 --> 06:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
appeal part of that process at the
 
06:07:51.270 --> 06:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
council level the Supreme Court does not
 
06:07:53.628 --> 06:07:53.638 align:start position:0%
they do not invite new facts they do not
 
06:07:55.230 --> 06:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
review new facts they look at the record
 
06:07:59.270 --> 06:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:59.280 --> 06:08:03.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:08:03.910 --> 06:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:08.350 --> 06:08:08.360 align:start position:0%
CH testify separately or or not um I
 
06:08:10.430 --> 06:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to Bubble Up the question that I
 
06:08:13.070 --> 06:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
I asked the sponsor a minute ago I
 
06:08:14.750 --> 06:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's the section where I think in the
 
06:08:17.590 --> 06:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it's talking about uh input
 
06:08:19.510 --> 06:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
from the Department of
 
06:08:21.750 --> 06:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
Justice in that part where it says
 
06:08:24.110 --> 06:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
there's uh the bill is inconsistent with
 
06:08:26.030 --> 06:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
other provisions of law is that
 
06:08:28.830 --> 06:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
suggesting that there's sort of I guess
 
06:08:30.590 --> 06:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
I'll call it a flaw or a need for an
 
06:08:32.270 --> 06:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
amendment in this bill that would
 
06:08:35.350 --> 06:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
reconcile sort of the way it discusses
 
06:08:38.750 --> 06:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
the the process of of which whether it's
 
06:08:41.070 --> 06:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
the council's or the the department
 
06:08:43.350 --> 06:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
itself that would appeal to the Supreme
 
06:08:46.110 --> 06:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
Court if I'm understanding what's stated
 
06:08:48.150 --> 06:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
there yes thank you for that question
 
06:08:49.948 --> 06:08:49.958 align:start position:0%
and uh I did actually probably write
 
06:08:52.150 --> 06:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
that fiscal note so uh I was going to
 
06:08:54.230 --> 06:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
testify about that today again not for
 
06:08:55.750 --> 06:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
or against but simply to say is there a
 
06:08:58.110 --> 06:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
disconnect between what's someone's
 
06:08:59.390 --> 06:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
trying to achieve and what they actually
 
06:09:01.990 --> 06:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
need to do um that would take me just a
 
06:09:03.468 --> 06:09:03.478 align:start position:0%
couple minutes if the chair is okay I
 
06:09:06.110 --> 06:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
can go through those comments sure yeah
 
06:09:08.750 --> 06:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
please go ahead um so I think part of
 
06:09:10.310 --> 06:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
the issue is just understanding exactly
 
06:09:12.548 --> 06:09:12.558 align:start position:0%
how these um appeals work and I guess I
 
06:09:14.350 --> 06:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
have the pleasure of doing them uh all
 
06:09:19.990 --> 06:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
the time but 210 sets up a standard
 
06:09:22.430 --> 06:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
whereby Dees decisions are appealed to
 
06:09:25.310 --> 06:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
one of four environmental
 
06:09:29.430 --> 06:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
councils our say 541 which is what is
 
06:09:33.270 --> 06:09:33.280 align:start position:0%
being amended here um does not come into
 
06:09:35.310 --> 06:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
play between the agency and the appeal
 
06:09:39.830 --> 06:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
to the councils in fact 541 colon 2 says
 
06:09:41.708 --> 06:09:41.718 align:start position:0%
that the entire Act only comes into play
 
06:09:43.070 --> 06:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
if it's provided for by law in other
 
06:09:44.670 --> 06:09:44.680 align:start position:0%
words the law for whatever you're doing
 
06:09:46.910 --> 06:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
has to say this is going to happen in
 
06:09:49.150 --> 06:09:49.160 align:start position:0%
accordance with RSA
 
06:09:52.468 --> 06:09:52.478 align:start position:0%
541 Dees does not have that statute it
 
06:09:54.468 --> 06:09:54.478 align:start position:0%
says 210 says that will be appealed to
 
06:09:56.910 --> 06:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
the councils the councils have a statute
 
06:09:58.750 --> 06:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
that at the end of it says appeals from
 
06:10:03.190 --> 06:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
the councils will occur pursuant to 541
 
06:10:04.830 --> 06:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
so they go to the Supreme Court they
 
06:10:06.150 --> 06:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
follow that
 
06:10:09.350 --> 06:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
process the changes in the bill seem to
 
06:10:13.110 --> 06:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
assume that um by changing 541 you're
 
06:10:15.788 --> 06:10:15.798 align:start position:0%
going to change the way that Dees
 
06:10:18.270 --> 06:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
decisions are reviewed but you won't
 
06:10:20.390 --> 06:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
because you're not changing 210 you
 
06:10:22.310 --> 06:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
really what if you want to achieve that
 
06:10:23.910 --> 06:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
you go back to 210 and you'd have to
 
06:10:26.150 --> 06:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
change that whole structure um and do
 
06:10:29.150 --> 06:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
something else there so for instance um
 
06:10:32.990 --> 06:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
you know 541 colon 13 here and the new
 
06:10:34.990 --> 06:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
541 colon
 
06:10:38.070 --> 06:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
13A um you know 13A says Department of
 
06:10:39.390 --> 06:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services orders of
 
06:10:41.350 --> 06:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
decisions so presumably that means this
 
06:10:43.548 --> 06:10:43.558 align:start position:0%
is how it's going to work for that and
 
06:10:45.230 --> 06:10:45.240 align:start position:0%
then it says upon a hearing where a
 
06:10:47.070 --> 06:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
party is seeking to set aside any order
 
06:10:50.628 --> 06:10:50.638 align:start position:0%
or decision issued under RSA 210 those
 
06:10:52.830 --> 06:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
decisions are not Dees decisions those
 
06:10:54.868 --> 06:10:54.878 align:start position:0%
decisions are decisions of the council
 
06:10:57.110 --> 06:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
and so you'd have to go back to 210
 
06:11:01.990 --> 06:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
um and change that as well um so I I
 
06:11:04.030 --> 06:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
think that might answer some of the
 
06:11:05.390 --> 06:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
question that you had let me follow up
 
06:11:07.670 --> 06:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
on that to see if you have more and then
 
06:11:10.830 --> 06:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
I'll continue I guess um thank you that
 
06:11:14.548 --> 06:11:14.558 align:start position:0%
that helps a lot um so is it your
 
06:11:17.468 --> 06:11:17.478 align:start position:0%
thought that this could be amended to
 
06:11:20.830 --> 06:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
clean up that conflict or that this
 
06:11:22.868 --> 06:11:22.878 align:start position:0%
really would have to be a completely
 
06:11:27.150 --> 06:11:27.160 align:start position:0%
separate piece acting on 210
 
06:11:30.230 --> 06:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
it would be a fairly significant rewrite
 
06:11:33.150 --> 06:11:33.160 align:start position:0%
of the bill and it would focus on 210
 
06:11:34.948 --> 06:11:34.958 align:start position:0%
and again I'm not here for or against
 
06:11:37.110 --> 06:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
it's up to the folks policy decide what
 
06:11:39.510 --> 06:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
they want to do but it would be a a
 
06:11:42.868 --> 06:11:42.878 align:start position:0%
fairly significant change to 210 and you
 
06:11:45.788 --> 06:11:45.798 align:start position:0%
wouldn't see these things appear for the
 
06:11:48.788 --> 06:11:48.798 align:start position:0%
most part in 541 at all okay can I ask
 
06:11:51.590 --> 06:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
one more one more follow course yes
 
06:11:54.948 --> 06:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
um it because this is content is just in
 
06:11:59.110 --> 06:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
the fiscal mode um um uh when I asked
 
06:12:01.670 --> 06:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
the sponsor she sort of pointed to the
 
06:12:03.350 --> 06:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
fact that the fiscal note says because
 
06:12:05.670 --> 06:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
of this conflict it would be difficult
 
06:12:07.628 --> 06:12:07.638 align:start position:0%
to determine how much additional
 
06:12:10.750 --> 06:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
litigation would be caused is the issue
 
06:12:13.788 --> 06:12:13.798 align:start position:0%
more structural than just sort of the
 
06:12:16.230 --> 06:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
the increase in litigation like would it
 
06:12:19.708 --> 06:12:19.718 align:start position:0%
would it cause true sort of uh
 
06:12:21.910 --> 06:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
dissonance I guess I call it within
 
06:12:25.190 --> 06:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
within the law that really shouldn't be
 
06:12:26.548 --> 06:12:26.558 align:start position:0%
present or is it or is it just to a
 
06:12:27.830 --> 06:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
matter of the courts would have to sort
 
06:12:30.708 --> 06:12:30.718 align:start position:0%
it out the actual comment that was
 
06:12:32.468 --> 06:12:32.478 align:start position:0%
written was based on saying we'd have a
 
06:12:34.030 --> 06:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
confused structure here because you
 
06:12:35.468 --> 06:12:35.478 align:start position:0%
would not be matching up the two
 
06:12:37.830 --> 06:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
sections and so neither Dees nor the
 
06:12:39.430 --> 06:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
councils nor the courts would really
 
06:12:41.430 --> 06:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
know how to reconcile that and that
 
06:12:44.030 --> 06:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
would be uh some cost there now if you
 
06:12:46.030 --> 06:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
redid it and restructured that in some
 
06:12:48.510 --> 06:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
other way there may be a cost associated
 
06:12:50.468 --> 06:12:50.478 align:start position:0%
with that I have to in order to give you
 
06:12:52.270 --> 06:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
a fiscal opinion on that I have a
 
06:12:54.310 --> 06:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
process I'd have to go through to
 
06:12:57.670 --> 06:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
say other questions for this witness uh
 
06:12:59.270 --> 06:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I did have some other
 
06:13:00.510 --> 06:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
information I just wanted to make sure I
 
06:13:01.990 --> 06:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
was finishing his question is that okay
 
06:13:06.468 --> 06:13:06.478 align:start position:0%
oh of course yeah go ahead um so uh you
 
06:13:08.590 --> 06:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
already mentioned uh chairman about the
 
06:13:10.310 --> 06:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court now taking in information
 
06:13:13.788 --> 06:13:13.798 align:start position:0%
so I won't do that uh again the standard
 
06:13:15.788 --> 06:13:15.798 align:start position:0%
has already been mentioned as well uh
 
06:13:17.948 --> 06:13:17.958 align:start position:0%
about arbitrary and capricious we've
 
06:13:20.270 --> 06:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
interpreted this language basically to
 
06:13:22.150 --> 06:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
be very similar to the arbitrary and
 
06:13:23.628 --> 06:13:23.638 align:start position:0%
capricious standard anyway even though
 
06:13:24.990 --> 06:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
we don't use that language in fact the
 
06:13:27.070 --> 06:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
old rule set for the Wetland rules used
 
06:13:28.548 --> 06:13:28.558 align:start position:0%
to say arbitrary and capricious because
 
06:13:29.670 --> 06:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
that's how they interpreted this
 
06:13:31.990 --> 06:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
language I don't think that is would
 
06:13:33.788 --> 06:13:33.798 align:start position:0%
really be a change if anything it may be
 
06:13:35.948 --> 06:13:35.958 align:start position:0%
more slightly more differential to the
 
06:13:39.230 --> 06:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
agency but uh in 13A it doesn't just do
 
06:13:43.270 --> 06:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
that in paragraph two it sets up uh a
 
06:13:45.590 --> 06:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
through I of reasons why things can be
 
06:13:47.830 --> 06:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
overturned some of those are new some of
 
06:13:49.510 --> 06:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
them are done by courts anyway U but it
 
06:13:52.150 --> 06:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
says one reason that a DS decision can
 
06:13:53.750 --> 06:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
be overturned is that it's not supported
 
06:13:56.468 --> 06:13:56.478 align:start position:0%
by substantial evidence that's a very
 
06:13:58.190 --> 06:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
new standard and a very low standard for
 
06:14:00.628 --> 06:14:00.638 align:start position:0%
anyone that wants to challenge something
 
06:14:03.190 --> 06:14:03.200 align:start position:0%
um again this is in 541 but it's saying
 
06:14:05.190 --> 06:14:05.200 align:start position:0%
talking about taking additional evidence
 
06:14:06.270 --> 06:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
it's talking about a motion for
 
06:14:08.750 --> 06:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
disqualification was made that can be a
 
06:14:10.350 --> 06:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
subject for overturning it but there's
 
06:14:11.948 --> 06:14:11.958 align:start position:0%
if you're dealing with the agency
 
06:14:14.030 --> 06:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
there's no motions for disqualification
 
06:14:15.788 --> 06:14:15.798 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen there so I'm not
 
06:14:17.510 --> 06:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
sure what was
 
06:14:20.468 --> 06:14:20.478 align:start position:0%
envisioned um there's also a provision
 
06:14:21.708 --> 06:14:21.718 align:start position:0%
that's actually more lenient to the
 
06:14:25.350 --> 06:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
agency in h that says um if the order is
 
06:14:26.750 --> 06:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with the rules of the
 
06:14:29.430 --> 06:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
agency unless the agency explains why
 
06:14:31.270 --> 06:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
that inconsistency is reasonable right
 
06:14:35.430 --> 06:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
now an agency can't operate in conflict
 
06:14:37.070 --> 06:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
with its rules and this is saying well
 
06:14:39.868 --> 06:14:39.878 align:start position:0%
they can if they demonstrate why so I
 
06:14:41.430 --> 06:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
think that may want to be looked at as
 
06:14:43.548 --> 06:14:43.558 align:start position:0%
well um and then paragraph three I don't
 
06:14:44.628 --> 06:14:44.638 align:start position:0%
think the Cher mentioned this but
 
06:14:46.430 --> 06:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph three for the Supreme Court
 
06:14:48.750 --> 06:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
seems to set up a whole new uh Paradigm
 
06:14:50.510 --> 06:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
where if a person's rights were violated
 
06:14:52.030 --> 06:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
by the agency's failure to perform an
 
06:14:53.948 --> 06:14:53.958 align:start position:0%
action there's a whole new complaint as
 
06:14:55.670 --> 06:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
if we're in a civil action Supreme
 
06:14:57.628 --> 06:14:57.638 align:start position:0%
Court's not set up for that and that the
 
06:14:59.110 --> 06:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
court may hear evidence on material
 
06:15:00.750 --> 06:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
issues raised in the petition and
 
06:15:02.390 --> 06:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
answerers so they don't do that
 
06:15:05.510 --> 06:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
either um and I just wanted to give one
 
06:15:07.868 --> 06:15:07.878 align:start position:0%
of the U members asked about statistics
 
06:15:10.310 --> 06:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
and data on these things if you want to
 
06:15:13.150 --> 06:15:13.160 align:start position:0%
look at how many people are upset enough
 
06:15:16.270 --> 06:15:16.280 align:start position:0%
about a Dees decision to go as far as an
 
06:15:20.270 --> 06:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
appeal if you Google nhdes look for uh
 
06:15:22.548 --> 06:15:22.558 align:start position:0%
rules and Regulatory pull that screen
 
06:15:24.910 --> 06:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
down it's there's a page for appeals and
 
06:15:26.468 --> 06:15:26.478 align:start position:0%
you can see the four councils all the
 
06:15:28.030 --> 06:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
dockets and you can see kind of what
 
06:15:32.390 --> 06:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
they do I'd say um probably two or three
 
06:15:34.430 --> 06:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
a year for the air Council maybe five
 
06:15:38.390 --> 06:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
for the waste Council um Wetlands is a
 
06:15:40.270 --> 06:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
busy Bureau so they get more they might
 
06:15:44.628 --> 06:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
get 10 or 15 a year um but I also just
 
06:15:48.430 --> 06:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
want people to understand that if you if
 
06:15:52.110 --> 06:15:52.120 align:start position:0%
you change the standard of review and
 
06:15:54.670 --> 06:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
you make it easier to overturn a Dees
 
06:15:57.830 --> 06:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
decision that it Cuts both ways so
 
06:16:01.230 --> 06:16:01.240 align:start position:0%
you're making it easier for a person who
 
06:16:04.910 --> 06:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
was denied a permit to overcome that
 
06:16:06.270 --> 06:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
decision but you're also if you've
 
06:16:07.430 --> 06:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
actually gotten that permit you're
 
06:16:09.948 --> 06:16:09.958 align:start position:0%
making it easy for easier for uh in a
 
06:16:12.830 --> 06:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
butter or someone else to overturn that
 
06:16:14.430 --> 06:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
permit and so if you look through the
 
06:16:17.910 --> 06:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
dockets for the air Council the last 10
 
06:16:20.628 --> 06:16:20.638 align:start position:0%
cases um only two appeals were by
 
06:16:22.310 --> 06:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
permites eight were by neighbors for the
 
06:16:24.430 --> 06:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
waste Council it's split the last 10
 
06:16:26.190 --> 06:16:26.200 align:start position:0%
it's basically five and five five times
 
06:16:28.708 --> 06:16:28.718 align:start position:0%
a permit or an applicant didn't get what
 
06:16:31.110 --> 06:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
they wanted and they appealed that five
 
06:16:32.430 --> 06:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
times an applicant did get what they
 
06:16:33.830 --> 06:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
wanted and then the neighbor appealed
 
06:16:35.948 --> 06:16:35.958 align:start position:0%
that so there's there's not a you're not
 
06:16:38.788 --> 06:16:38.798 align:start position:0%
creating a trend where one you know um
 
06:16:40.230 --> 06:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
section of the public is being more
 
06:16:42.628 --> 06:16:42.638 align:start position:0%
satisfied or not you're just basically
 
06:16:45.590 --> 06:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
creating maybe more uncertainty um with
 
06:16:47.390 --> 06:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
respect to an agency decision which if
 
06:16:49.310 --> 06:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
that's your policy that's okay but just
 
06:16:51.070 --> 06:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
no it doesn't favor the people who are
 
06:16:52.468 --> 06:16:52.478 align:start position:0%
more protective of the environment less
 
06:16:54.110 --> 06:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
protective or the people who want a
 
06:16:56.110 --> 06:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
permit or don't want a permit it's just
 
06:16:58.030 --> 06:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
basically it's a lower bar for whoever
 
06:17:02.468 --> 06:17:02.478 align:start position:0%
wants to challenge whatever the decision
 
06:17:06.110 --> 06:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
was other questions for this witness so
 
06:17:08.670 --> 06:17:08.680 align:start position:0%
I guess I just have one I I'm as my
 
06:17:10.230 --> 06:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
questions may have I'm I'm not
 
06:17:12.310 --> 06:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
particularly persuaded on the merits of
 
06:17:14.030 --> 06:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
changing the standard I mean I'm not
 
06:17:15.750 --> 06:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
really sure it's much of a change anyway
 
06:17:17.868 --> 06:17:17.878 align:start position:0%
but but the one thing that I that does
 
06:17:19.948 --> 06:17:19.958 align:start position:0%
concern me
 
06:17:23.548 --> 06:17:23.558 align:start position:0%
is we've we've gotten at least some
 
06:17:25.990 --> 06:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
information um and I'm not talking about
 
06:17:28.310 --> 06:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
at this hearing but but some information
 
06:17:31.110 --> 06:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
suggesting that these various councils
 
06:17:33.750 --> 06:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
which are as I understand it quite
 
06:17:37.868 --> 06:17:37.878 align:start position:0%
large um that that is a a source of some
 
06:17:40.990 --> 06:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
insufficient I mean inefficiency in the
 
06:17:42.750 --> 06:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
time it takes for the appeals to be
 
06:17:44.708 --> 06:17:44.718 align:start position:0%
resolved and it get then by the time it
 
06:17:45.910 --> 06:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
gets to the court and goes through the
 
06:17:47.948 --> 06:17:47.958 align:start position:0%
court process and I guess what I'm
 
06:17:50.788 --> 06:17:50.798 align:start position:0%
wondering is would it make
 
06:17:54.150 --> 06:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
sense to have instead of these various
 
06:17:56.830 --> 06:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
councils to have an administrative
 
06:17:59.830 --> 06:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
appeal tribunal one administrative
 
06:18:01.110 --> 06:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
appeal tribunal that would be
 
06:18:04.590 --> 06:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
sufficiently independent from Dees but
 
06:18:07.670 --> 06:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
would handle all of those um you know as
 
06:18:10.670 --> 06:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to these councils which are not
 
06:18:12.270 --> 06:18:12.280 align:start position:0%
I mean they're they're you know I'm I'm
 
06:18:13.590 --> 06:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
sure they're excellent people that serve
 
06:18:14.708 --> 06:18:14.718 align:start position:0%
on the council but they're sort of
 
06:18:17.190 --> 06:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
volunteers as I understand it and they
 
06:18:18.670 --> 06:18:18.680 align:start position:0%
um there sometime they're not available
 
06:18:20.350 --> 06:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
and they're switching we've heard
 
06:18:22.190 --> 06:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
evidence of switching
 
06:18:24.868 --> 06:18:24.878 align:start position:0%
between like you know not all of them
 
06:18:27.390 --> 06:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
are if if it's it's a multi-day or
 
06:18:29.990 --> 06:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
multi- week proceeding or something not
 
06:18:32.830 --> 06:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
everybody may be there for for all the
 
06:18:34.990 --> 06:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
hearing so would it make more sense to
 
06:18:36.350 --> 06:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
do something like
 
06:18:38.430 --> 06:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
that yes and I'm sure you're familiar
 
06:18:41.310 --> 06:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
there's always a um kind of a conflict
 
06:18:44.030 --> 06:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
between process and speed right so we
 
06:18:45.670 --> 06:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
used to have a certified record appeal
 
06:18:47.150 --> 06:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
those went very fast I could do two in a
 
06:18:49.548 --> 06:18:49.558 align:start position:0%
day um but you didn't get to say
 
06:18:50.910 --> 06:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
anything extra and so people weren't
 
06:18:52.270 --> 06:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
able to be heard so they changed that
 
06:18:54.350 --> 06:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
and they made the council's able to hear
 
06:18:56.150 --> 06:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
more but now every hearing takes between
 
06:18:57.830 --> 06:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
two and four days basically to get
 
06:18:58.990 --> 06:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
through the council that means you need
 
06:19:00.150 --> 06:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
four days when you have the council
 
06:19:03.230 --> 06:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
members there um so I think there was an
 
06:19:05.070 --> 06:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
efficiency in the council process we can
 
06:19:07.270 --> 06:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
see whether that continues but last
 
06:19:09.510 --> 06:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
session there were people looking at
 
06:19:10.990 --> 06:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
this very closely and actually passed a
 
06:19:13.070 --> 06:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
bill where it changed what you need to
 
06:19:15.990 --> 06:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
do so I believe right now it used to be
 
06:19:18.948 --> 06:19:18.958 align:start position:0%
if you had a you know 13 member body you
 
06:19:21.230 --> 06:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
needed to at least have a quorum there
 
06:19:22.590 --> 06:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
at this point I think it's changed to
 
06:19:23.910 --> 06:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
say you need to have at least three
 
06:19:25.990 --> 06:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
people um from the council there and
 
06:19:27.548 --> 06:19:27.558 align:start position:0%
then the other ones can come if they you
 
06:19:29.270 --> 06:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
know if they're able to so the hope is
 
06:19:31.948 --> 06:19:31.958 align:start position:0%
that for scheduling purposes that would
 
06:19:34.430 --> 06:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
make it easier um and I think there's
 
06:19:37.830 --> 06:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
actually a chair of a um a council here
 
06:19:39.750 --> 06:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
in the room who works very hard at doing
 
06:19:43.150 --> 06:19:43.160 align:start position:0%
this job um and um can tell you a little
 
06:19:45.150 --> 06:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
bit more about that but I'm sure that
 
06:19:46.868 --> 06:19:46.878 align:start position:0%
there you know things could be better
 
06:19:49.310 --> 06:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
but the idea was last session that that
 
06:19:51.548 --> 06:19:51.558 align:start position:0%
bill um that pretty significantly
 
06:19:53.030 --> 06:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
changed that process and looked at all
 
06:19:54.510 --> 06:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
these different you know opportunities
 
06:19:56.230 --> 06:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
do you want environmental l do you want
 
06:19:57.788 --> 06:19:57.798 align:start position:0%
to have a one panel do you want to have
 
06:20:00.350 --> 06:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
the four councils resulted in this and I
 
06:20:03.310 --> 06:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
think it it may be wise to let that play
 
06:20:04.868 --> 06:20:04.878 align:start position:0%
out for a while to see if that actually
 
06:20:07.910 --> 06:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
helped okay all right good point other
 
06:20:10.868 --> 06:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness seeing well
 
06:20:12.430 --> 06:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
for both Witnesses and is there anything
 
06:20:13.788 --> 06:20:13.798 align:start position:0%
else either one of you wanted to say
 
06:20:16.110 --> 06:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
please I don't mean to cut you off all
 
06:20:17.708 --> 06:20:17.718 align:start position:0%
right well thank you very much thank you
 
06:20:19.830 --> 06:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
thank you all right
 
06:20:23.150 --> 06:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
next yes yes yep know I got them from
 
06:20:33.548 --> 06:20:33.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:37.030 --> 06:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon I'm chip Kimble
 
06:20:38.708 --> 06:20:38.718 align:start position:0%
and I'm the chair of the wetlands
 
06:20:42.390 --> 06:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
Council a little quick history I started
 
06:20:45.310 --> 06:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
my career for about 15 years doing
 
06:20:47.270 --> 06:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
construction involved in construction
 
06:20:49.070 --> 06:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
litigation and then found out I could do
 
06:20:51.070 --> 06:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
better I wrote computer
 
06:20:54.230 --> 06:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
software and I did that and in
 
06:20:56.788 --> 06:20:56.798 align:start position:0%
1991 I began at the sandwich
 
06:20:58.830 --> 06:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission after serving 15
 
06:21:01.548 --> 06:21:01.558 align:start position:0%
years there in 2007 I went on to the
 
06:21:04.628 --> 06:21:04.638 align:start position:0%
council and I've been chair since 2008
 
06:21:06.390 --> 06:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
and a half or something like
 
06:21:10.910 --> 06:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
that so uh there's there's uh quite a
 
06:21:13.150 --> 06:21:13.160 align:start position:0%
few questions that were arise that arose
 
06:21:15.350 --> 06:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
that I can maybe answer before what I
 
06:21:19.390 --> 06:21:19.400 align:start position:0%
was going to say um first I just want
 
06:21:22.590 --> 06:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
you to understand that uh and it comes
 
06:21:24.468 --> 06:21:24.478 align:start position:0%
out from one day at coffee as I was
 
06:21:26.070 --> 06:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
leaving to come down here the Wetland
 
06:21:28.548 --> 06:21:28.558 align:start position:0%
council person said go out there and
 
06:21:30.948 --> 06:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
protect the environment and I said we
 
06:21:32.310 --> 06:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
don't protect the environment we protect
 
06:21:32.320 --> 06:21:33.150 align:start position:0%
don't protect the environment we protect
the

06:21:33.150 --> 06:21:33.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:21:36.310 --> 06:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
statute and that's what we look at our
 
06:21:39.310 --> 06:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
job as and
 
06:21:43.150 --> 06:21:43.160 align:start position:0%
so when we're when we're there that's
 
06:21:44.990 --> 06:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's it we're looking at the statute
 
06:21:47.430 --> 06:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
and and on these appeals and looking at
 
06:21:49.708 --> 06:21:49.718 align:start position:0%
the rules and doing that we aren't
 
06:21:51.868 --> 06:21:51.878 align:start position:0%
wandering off
 
06:21:56.590 --> 06:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully um because of somebody's you
 
06:22:01.548 --> 06:22:01.558 align:start position:0%
know desires okay try and uh answer
 
06:22:03.750 --> 06:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
repesent representative Alexander gave
 
06:22:06.788 --> 06:22:06.798 align:start position:0%
us some good reasons for why she's
 
06:22:08.310 --> 06:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill but I just want to
 
06:22:10.948 --> 06:22:10.958 align:start position:0%
respond a few things I did get an email
 
06:22:10.958 --> 06:22:11.788 align:start position:0%
respond a few things I did get an email
this

06:22:11.788 --> 06:22:11.798 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:22:14.590 --> 06:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
morning uh that stated there were only
 
06:22:16.670 --> 06:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
three missing members on the water
 
06:22:19.670 --> 06:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
Council and three on our on our Council
 
06:22:22.230 --> 06:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
um it's always a kind of a rolling thing
 
06:22:24.230 --> 06:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
members of the council are
 
06:22:27.230 --> 06:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
generally state state agency reps so
 
06:22:29.510 --> 06:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's dot fishing
 
06:22:33.310 --> 06:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
game uh state parks uh things people
 
06:22:36.468 --> 06:22:36.478 align:start position:0%
people like that in our Council and also
 
06:22:38.750 --> 06:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
representing I represent uh nire
 
06:22:40.670 --> 06:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
Timberland owners land owners basically
 
06:22:45.350 --> 06:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:49.030 --> 06:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
commissions and Municipal Association
 
06:22:50.430 --> 06:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
things like
 
06:22:54.070 --> 06:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
that um there was a question about how
 
06:22:57.110 --> 06:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
many permits and what happened we just
 
06:22:59.750 --> 06:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday um had our meeting and I
 
06:23:01.590 --> 06:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
learned about this yesterday morning so
 
06:23:03.548 --> 06:23:03.558 align:start position:0%
we had a little chat about it we don't
 
06:23:06.270 --> 06:23:06.280 align:start position:0%
have a specific position except that we
 
06:23:08.628 --> 06:23:08.638 align:start position:0%
didn't like
 
06:23:12.468 --> 06:23:12.478 align:start position:0%
164 um there are last year there were
 
06:23:15.750 --> 06:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
about 3,000 uh wetlands and Shoreland
 
06:23:19.510 --> 06:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
total permits there were 13 new appeals
 
06:23:22.270 --> 06:23:22.280 align:start position:0%
where we calculated we have about 26 or
 
06:23:25.070 --> 06:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
so in on our docket now some of them are
 
06:23:27.230 --> 06:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
stayed due to other litigation or
 
06:23:30.468 --> 06:23:30.478 align:start position:0%
attempts to resolve um the
 
06:23:32.670 --> 06:23:32.680 align:start position:0%
situation and there was another comment
 
06:23:34.788 --> 06:23:34.798 align:start position:0%
about new
 
06:23:37.990 --> 06:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
evidence we do uh accept during an
 
06:23:39.948 --> 06:23:39.958 align:start position:0%
appeal the new new evidence that comes
 
06:23:41.830 --> 06:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
in and as
 
06:23:45.430 --> 06:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
a and that would we take the department
 
06:23:48.110 --> 06:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
record and then people can bring in uh
 
06:23:49.708 --> 06:23:49.718 align:start position:0%
new evidence and we consider the new
 
06:23:53.230 --> 06:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
evidence from both sides as to what when
 
06:23:54.390 --> 06:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
we make our
 
06:23:54.400 --> 06:23:56.230 align:start position:0%
we make our
decision

06:23:56.230 --> 06:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
decision
 
06:23:59.190 --> 06:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
um but it's not a denovo review we
 
06:24:02.390 --> 06:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
aren't going through every aspect of the
 
06:24:05.868 --> 06:24:05.878 align:start position:0%
whole decision we're only looking at the
 
06:24:09.230 --> 06:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
appeal that's been requested on what
 
06:24:09.240 --> 06:24:10.948 align:start position:0%
appeal that's been requested on what
particular

06:24:10.948 --> 06:24:10.958 align:start position:0%
particular
 
06:24:16.510 --> 06:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
items um I I do have to comment and not
 
06:24:19.990 --> 06:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
to be discourage disparaging on repr
 
06:24:22.190 --> 06:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
Senator Alexander but this idea that
 
06:24:25.708 --> 06:24:25.718 align:start position:0%
we're judge jury and executioner we
 
06:24:27.990 --> 06:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
highly you
 
06:24:31.510 --> 06:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
know we don't like that we we are separ
 
06:24:33.590 --> 06:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I'm not sure it was rep I
 
06:24:35.390 --> 06:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
think you may have I'm not sure it was
 
06:24:36.948 --> 06:24:36.958 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander well whoever
 
06:24:39.468 --> 06:24:39.478 align:start position:0%
said that but and I'm not you know
 
06:24:40.750 --> 06:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
that's not the only person that thinks
 
06:24:43.430 --> 06:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
this but you know there's a there's a
 
06:24:44.948 --> 06:24:44.958 align:start position:0%
just a thought out there that when they
 
06:24:46.390 --> 06:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
come before the council they're coming
 
06:24:49.390 --> 06:24:49.400 align:start position:0%
before Dees and we're just hand and you
 
06:24:52.350 --> 06:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
know p with them but that's that's not
 
06:24:52.360 --> 06:24:54.070 align:start position:0%
know p with them but that's that's not
true

06:24:54.070 --> 06:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
true
 
06:24:56.910 --> 06:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
um as as far as the time to
 
06:25:00.708 --> 06:25:00.718 align:start position:0%
resolve uh which was uh spoken
 
06:25:03.868 --> 06:25:03.878 align:start position:0%
about I frankly only learned last year
 
06:25:06.750 --> 06:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
when they brought this three uh member
 
06:25:09.590 --> 06:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
Quorum up that some of the other
 
06:25:12.670 --> 06:25:12.680 align:start position:0%
councils actually would have a multi-day
 
06:25:14.948 --> 06:25:14.958 align:start position:0%
hearing and have different people at the
 
06:25:17.510 --> 06:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
hearing at at the water at the Wetland
 
06:25:19.830 --> 06:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
Council if you show up the first day and
 
06:25:21.070 --> 06:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
then you don't show up the second day
 
06:25:22.990 --> 06:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
just don't show up any other day or if
 
06:25:24.590 --> 06:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
you show up on the second day not having
 
06:25:26.948 --> 06:25:26.958 align:start position:0%
been on the first day they you know
 
06:25:30.670 --> 06:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
you're out you don't even show so that
 
06:25:32.350 --> 06:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
that's they shouldn't be doing
 
06:25:37.390 --> 06:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
that say that um and as far as the time
 
06:25:42.468 --> 06:25:42.478 align:start position:0%
I I want to mention that sp84 was
 
06:25:44.910 --> 06:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
already passed by the House and Senate
 
06:25:48.030 --> 06:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
and that was the carryover bill that
 
06:25:50.708 --> 06:25:50.718 align:start position:0%
included the study committee to review
 
06:25:53.030 --> 06:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
the dees environmental Council appeals
 
06:25:57.430 --> 06:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
process okay which last year because the
 
06:26:00.070 --> 06:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
members weren't appointed in time it's
 
06:26:02.788 --> 06:26:02.798 align:start position:0%
like October was it then we couldn't
 
06:26:04.948 --> 06:26:04.958 align:start position:0%
actually start the committee we were do
 
06:26:07.628 --> 06:26:07.638 align:start position:0%
you know I think October 25th is when uh
 
06:26:09.430 --> 06:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn was appointed as
 
06:26:11.310 --> 06:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
chair of the committee and then we found
 
06:26:12.548 --> 06:26:12.558 align:start position:0%
out we were supposed
 
06:26:14.510 --> 06:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
to the committee is supposed to meet
 
06:26:17.190 --> 06:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
with the council chairs and go over this
 
06:26:20.788 --> 06:26:20.798 align:start position:0%
process to try to speed it up and make
 
06:26:23.590 --> 06:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
it more consistent and I would suggest
 
06:26:25.510 --> 06:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
that that's what should be done instead
 
06:26:27.548 --> 06:26:27.558 align:start position:0%
of this bill at this point or certainly
 
06:26:29.190 --> 06:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
the first part of this
 
06:26:31.590 --> 06:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
bill um but that's been reinstated
 
06:26:33.190 --> 06:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
assuming the governor will sign it initi
 
06:26:37.270 --> 06:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
year will'll in in the summer get get
 
06:26:39.510 --> 06:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
that study committee
 
06:26:39.520 --> 06:26:41.670 align:start position:0%
that study committee
going

06:26:41.670 --> 06:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
going
 
06:26:46.230 --> 06:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
so what I attorney Brooks has already
 
06:26:48.868 --> 06:26:48.878 align:start position:0%
talked about the use of the word court
 
06:26:51.310 --> 06:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
or the councils it's very confusing in
 
06:26:52.750 --> 06:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
here what they're talking about are they
 
06:26:53.910 --> 06:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
talking about the court are they talking
 
06:26:55.868 --> 06:26:55.878 align:start position:0%
about The councils Who
 
06:26:58.510 --> 06:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
referred to
 
06:27:02.670 --> 06:27:02.680 align:start position:0%
um the list and I went through the list
 
06:27:04.070 --> 06:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
and it was interesting to hear
 
06:27:06.628 --> 06:27:06.638 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander talk about
 
06:27:08.150 --> 06:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
particularly arbitrary and capricious
 
06:27:09.910 --> 06:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
because I read arbitrary and capricious
 
06:27:11.750 --> 06:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
and so that doesn't changed that doesn't
 
06:27:14.430 --> 06:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
change anything to me in fact it's kind
 
06:27:16.990 --> 06:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
of I've never
 
06:27:21.310 --> 06:27:21.320 align:start position:0%
seen anyway that is uh doesn't seem to
 
06:27:23.110 --> 06:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
me to make a change that they would
 
06:27:26.628 --> 06:27:26.638 align:start position:0%
really want um the other items are
 
06:27:30.070 --> 06:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
really I think we pretty much already do
 
06:27:33.750 --> 06:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
all of the things that are in here in
 
06:27:35.190 --> 06:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
the way that's
 
06:27:37.590 --> 06:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
described the only thing is we seldom
 
06:27:40.510 --> 06:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
have anyone claim a constitutional issue
 
06:27:42.548 --> 06:27:42.558 align:start position:0%
before us they they'll mention it but we
 
06:27:43.990 --> 06:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
don't really deal with it because we'll
 
06:27:45.830 --> 06:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
reject it and it goes up to the Supreme
 
06:27:47.548 --> 06:27:47.558 align:start position:0%
Court and if they want to agree with it
 
06:27:50.510 --> 06:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's up to
 
06:27:53.548 --> 06:27:53.558 align:start position:0%
them I would point out which I think
 
06:27:55.708 --> 06:27:55.718 align:start position:0%
attorney Brooks said the same thing is
 
06:27:58.788 --> 06:27:58.798 align:start position:0%
actually you know more differential to
 
06:28:03.150 --> 06:28:03.160 align:start position:0%
the uh Department um right now this this
 
06:28:06.270 --> 06:28:06.280 align:start position:0%
would allow the department to back
 
06:28:09.070 --> 06:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
figure and back come up with a solution
 
06:28:11.628 --> 06:28:11.638 align:start position:0%
for why they didn't follow the rules and
 
06:28:14.830 --> 06:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
right now if they don't follow the rule
 
06:28:17.110 --> 06:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
when they make the decision they can't
 
06:28:19.788 --> 06:28:19.798 align:start position:0%
back out of it the way we read it and
 
06:28:21.390 --> 06:28:21.400 align:start position:0%
the way we operate they can't back out
 
06:28:23.708 --> 06:28:23.718 align:start position:0%
of it you know no matter how much hand
 
06:28:26.830 --> 06:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
waving they do at the at the
 
06:28:33.030 --> 06:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:37.750 --> 06:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
three uh if by the court they meant the
 
06:28:37.760 --> 06:28:40.110 align:start position:0%
three uh if by the court they meant the
councils

06:28:40.110 --> 06:28:40.120 align:start position:0%
councils
 
06:28:43.190 --> 06:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
okay whoever they mean it seems like
 
06:28:46.350 --> 06:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
that creating a whole new right for
 
06:28:49.788 --> 06:28:49.798 align:start position:0%
somebody as a wide openen right to
 
06:28:53.910 --> 06:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
appeal a decision of the
 
06:28:53.920 --> 06:28:55.948 align:start position:0%
appeal a decision of the
department

06:28:55.948 --> 06:28:55.958 align:start position:0%
department
 
06:29:00.468 --> 06:29:00.478 align:start position:0%
before or after at at any time during
 
06:29:03.270 --> 06:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
the untold process whereas right now you
 
06:29:05.910 --> 06:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
have the decision 30 days you have 30
 
06:29:07.310 --> 06:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
days to appeal you appeal to the
 
06:29:10.708 --> 06:29:10.718 align:start position:0%
councils and then you uh the appeal goes
 
06:29:14.230 --> 06:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
forward so I don't know what
 
06:29:14.240 --> 06:29:15.910 align:start position:0%
forward so I don't know what
three

06:29:15.910 --> 06:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
three
 
06:29:19.708 --> 06:29:19.718 align:start position:0%
on the second part which is the
 
06:29:19.718 --> 06:29:23.150 align:start position:0%
on the second part which is the
rules

06:29:23.150 --> 06:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:27.230 --> 06:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
um we already if a rule exceeds the
 
06:29:29.788 --> 06:29:29.798 align:start position:0%
statutory authority of the agency we
 
06:29:32.390 --> 06:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
would and that was part of the
 
06:29:35.628 --> 06:29:35.638 align:start position:0%
appeal we would reject the rules and and
 
06:29:38.150 --> 06:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh remand it to Dees and and we've done
 
06:29:41.670 --> 06:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
that before
 
06:29:45.310 --> 06:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
um the rules are created just to
 
06:29:48.230 --> 06:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
understand how they the dees creates
 
06:29:51.910 --> 06:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
rules in a draft they're passed on to
 
06:29:55.230 --> 06:29:55.240 align:start position:0%
the council the council comments on the
 
06:29:58.510 --> 06:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
rules any and and we have since we have
 
06:30:00.830 --> 06:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
different members from representing
 
06:30:03.030 --> 06:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
different consistencies they can go on
 
06:30:05.830 --> 06:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
to their own agencies and bring the
 
06:30:09.190 --> 06:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
rules to them and then after they've
 
06:30:10.750 --> 06:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
done that then
 
06:30:14.830 --> 06:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
the the uh Department responds to those
 
06:30:14.840 --> 06:30:15.708 align:start position:0%
the the uh Department responds to those
our

06:30:15.708 --> 06:30:15.718 align:start position:0%
our
 
06:30:17.948 --> 06:30:17.958 align:start position:0%
comments then revises the rules and
 
06:30:19.310 --> 06:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
brings them out to the public and then
 
06:30:22.030 --> 06:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
the public comments and it goes on to
 
06:30:25.628 --> 06:30:25.638 align:start position:0%
eventually onto JL car so that's just so
 
06:30:28.190 --> 06:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
you understand the particular process
 
06:30:28.200 --> 06:30:31.430 align:start position:0%
you understand the particular process
some

06:30:31.430 --> 06:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:35.390 --> 06:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
moment I think that kind of covers it so
 
06:30:37.230 --> 06:30:37.240 align:start position:0%
all right as far as the rules we didn't
 
06:30:38.510 --> 06:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
have anything else but as far as
 
06:30:41.868 --> 06:30:41.878 align:start position:0%
changing the whole process we didn't we
 
06:30:43.310 --> 06:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a good way to do it I
 
06:30:44.750 --> 06:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
think a better thing we to do would be
 
06:30:47.628 --> 06:30:47.638 align:start position:0%
just make sure that the study committee
 
06:30:49.670 --> 06:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
looks at that and that representative
 
06:30:51.590 --> 06:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
Alexander and those people can certainly
 
06:30:53.750 --> 06:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know bring everything up before the
 
06:30:58.430 --> 06:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
study right questions for this
 
06:31:01.468 --> 06:31:01.478 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative Manos thank
 
06:31:03.350 --> 06:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
06:31:08.548 --> 06:31:08.558 align:start position:0%
question um you you said that um on
 
06:31:11.830 --> 06:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
appeal you can accept new evidence but
 
06:31:14.350 --> 06:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
you also said it's not a hearing denovo
 
06:31:17.310 --> 06:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
it's not a denovo hearing and I'm not
 
06:31:19.910 --> 06:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
understanding that distinction what I
 
06:31:23.030 --> 06:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
would mean by a denovo hearing is that
 
06:31:25.750 --> 06:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
the permit application and everything is
 
06:31:28.468 --> 06:31:28.478 align:start position:0%
completely reviewed all over again by
 
06:31:30.868 --> 06:31:30.878 align:start position:0%
the council and the council makes a in
 
06:31:34.070 --> 06:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
essence new decision on the permit on
 
06:31:35.590 --> 06:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
the on the issuance of the permit or the
 
06:31:40.430 --> 06:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
denial of per um what we do is we only
 
06:31:43.670 --> 06:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
hear what the appeal is based on so the
 
06:31:46.510 --> 06:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
appellant would might say okay they you
 
06:31:49.110 --> 06:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
know they didn't consider the dees
 
06:31:51.868 --> 06:31:51.878 align:start position:0%
didn't consider rule number 50613 on
 
06:31:51.878 --> 06:31:53.230 align:start position:0%
didn't consider rule number 50613 on
Rule

06:31:53.230 --> 06:31:53.240 align:start position:0%
Rule
 
06:31:57.548 --> 06:31:57.558 align:start position:0%
30321 and so we look at 50613 and 30321
 
06:31:59.190 --> 06:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
but we don't of our own
 
06:32:03.070 --> 06:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
valtion go ahead and dig into rule
 
06:32:06.548 --> 06:32:06.558 align:start position:0%
8002 which is to me a denovo would be we
 
06:32:09.830 --> 06:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
start all over again we look take
 
06:32:14.628 --> 06:32:14.638 align:start position:0%
the follow thank you Mr chair
 
06:32:18.150 --> 06:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
so when you accept new evidence does it
 
06:32:20.430 --> 06:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
have to be related directly related to
 
06:32:20.440 --> 06:32:21.948 align:start position:0%
have to be related directly related to
the

06:32:21.948 --> 06:32:21.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:32:25.910 --> 06:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
appeal or can it be new evidence
 
06:32:29.548 --> 06:32:29.558 align:start position:0%
that never was raised at all or never
 
06:32:33.070 --> 06:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
came came into the case never came in
 
06:32:36.070 --> 06:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
before to the department is that what
 
06:32:39.388 --> 06:32:39.398 align:start position:0%
you mean yes I mean and we did this just
 
06:32:42.788 --> 06:32:42.798 align:start position:0%
a couple months ago um it was a dispute
 
06:32:45.628 --> 06:32:45.638 align:start position:0%
about a an embankment that was a road
 
06:32:47.628 --> 06:32:47.638 align:start position:0%
that was sort of actually a dam that was
 
06:32:48.750 --> 06:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
sort of a
 
06:32:52.548 --> 06:32:52.558 align:start position:0%
culvert and the issue was raised about
 
06:32:55.150 --> 06:32:55.160 align:start position:0%
whether the eels came up to their or not
 
06:32:57.708 --> 06:32:57.718 align:start position:0%
and so they brought in evidence as to
 
06:33:00.430 --> 06:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
whether there were or were not eels in
 
06:33:03.350 --> 06:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
this particular area below which wasn't
 
06:33:05.670 --> 06:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
you know brought before the department
 
06:33:07.468 --> 06:33:07.478 align:start position:0%

06:33:48.030 --> 06:33:48.040 align:start position:0%
um former state representative I
 
06:33:49.430 --> 06:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
actually was down today at the
 
06:33:51.910 --> 06:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture committee uh
 
06:33:54.830 --> 06:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with some bills related to Dees
 
06:33:58.310 --> 06:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
policies and um saw that this this bill
 
06:34:00.310 --> 06:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
was on the the docket down here at
 
06:34:02.230 --> 06:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
Judiciary I don't have prepared
 
06:34:05.350 --> 06:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
testimony but I would like to uh just
 
06:34:08.948 --> 06:34:08.958 align:start position:0%
speak briefly about um years really of
 
06:34:10.310 --> 06:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
experience with the environmental
 
06:34:12.190 --> 06:34:12.200 align:start position:0%
councils in New Hampshire and I do think
 
06:34:14.510 --> 06:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
that reform is critically
 
06:34:16.548 --> 06:34:16.558 align:start position:0%
important I have reviewed the
 
06:34:18.310 --> 06:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
legislative history when these councils
 
06:34:20.310 --> 06:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
were created back in the 80s at about
 
06:34:23.150 --> 06:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
the same time the dees was uh being
 
06:34:25.830 --> 06:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
brought into into
 
06:34:28.670 --> 06:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
existence um I've been before various
 
06:34:31.270 --> 06:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
councils over the years from the 80s
 
06:34:34.430 --> 06:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
forward um beginning with I believe
 
06:34:34.440 --> 06:34:35.830 align:start position:0%
forward um beginning with I believe
Wetlands

06:34:35.830 --> 06:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
Wetlands
 
06:34:39.030 --> 06:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
Council very early on
 
06:34:42.110 --> 06:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
um and in more recent years we've been
 
06:34:43.910 --> 06:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
dealing more with the waste management
 
06:34:45.990 --> 06:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
Council and the air Resources
 
06:34:49.628 --> 06:34:49.638 align:start position:0%
Council um councils are quite different
 
06:34:53.230 --> 06:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
it depends who is on the on the the
 
06:34:55.350 --> 06:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
various councils uh depends on the
 
06:34:58.350 --> 06:34:58.360 align:start position:0%
vacancies where often the public seats
 
06:35:01.270 --> 06:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
are remain vacant for long periods of
 
06:35:04.628 --> 06:35:04.638 align:start position:0%
time so they are somewhat industry heavy
 
06:35:06.910 --> 06:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
in some cases I will say that I found
 
06:35:10.430 --> 06:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
the wetlands Council to be um the one
 
06:35:14.190 --> 06:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
that in my view functions um the
 
06:35:17.110 --> 06:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
best I've seen real problems uh with a
 
06:35:19.388 --> 06:35:19.398 align:start position:0%
couple of the other councils dealing
 
06:35:21.430 --> 06:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
with air issues and waste issues over
 
06:35:21.440 --> 06:35:22.150 align:start position:0%
with air issues and waste issues over
the

06:35:22.150 --> 06:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:35:25.548 --> 06:35:25.558 align:start position:0%
years um
 
06:35:27.350 --> 06:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
I don't have a lot more to add to that
 
06:35:28.990 --> 06:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
but I really just want to emphasize that
 
06:35:30.990 --> 06:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
I think reform is very important it was
 
06:35:33.190 --> 06:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
not a bill last year but a an amendment
 
06:35:35.350 --> 06:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
I believe to a budget bill or to a
 
06:35:37.510 --> 06:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
budget writer so we didn't really get a
 
06:35:40.628 --> 06:35:40.638 align:start position:0%
hearing on this issue last year um when
 
06:35:43.230 --> 06:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
the change was made uh having to do with
 
06:35:44.910 --> 06:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
quarum and the Department of Justice
 
06:35:46.510 --> 06:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
taking more of a role in sort of
 
06:35:49.190 --> 06:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
supporting the appeal process but the
 
06:35:53.110 --> 06:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
councils um they hear generally monthly
 
06:35:54.670 --> 06:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
from directors of which whichever
 
06:35:57.030 --> 06:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
division their you know is their subject
 
06:36:00.750 --> 06:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
of expertise um so there's sort of a a
 
06:36:02.990 --> 06:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
close relationship between Dees
 
06:36:04.788 --> 06:36:04.798 align:start position:0%
officials and council
 
06:36:04.798 --> 06:36:06.670 align:start position:0%
officials and council
members

06:36:06.670 --> 06:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
members
 
06:36:09.990 --> 06:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
um when you're bringing an appeal of a a
 
06:36:12.750 --> 06:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
agency decision this is a council that
 
06:36:14.750 --> 06:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
is very familiar with the people who've
 
06:36:19.430 --> 06:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
actually drafted and finally approved uh
 
06:36:19.440 --> 06:36:21.590 align:start position:0%
actually drafted and finally approved uh
permits

06:36:21.590 --> 06:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
permits
 
06:36:24.590 --> 06:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
um I think we could use a a process
 
06:36:25.750 --> 06:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
where there's a little bit more of an
 
06:36:29.708 --> 06:36:29.718 align:start position:0%
arms length relationship between the uhu
 
06:36:37.070 --> 06:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:39.868 --> 06:36:39.878 align:start position:0%
board I think I hadn't heard about this
 
06:36:41.750 --> 06:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh committee that may be doing a study
 
06:36:43.628 --> 06:36:43.638 align:start position:0%
this year and I think that's a positive
 
06:36:45.708 --> 06:36:45.718 align:start position:0%
step and I would hope that that would be
 
06:36:49.310 --> 06:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
open and noticed and available uh to
 
06:36:50.708 --> 06:36:50.718 align:start position:0%
members of the public who have been
 
06:36:52.430 --> 06:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
through the appeals process there there
 
06:36:53.868 --> 06:36:53.878 align:start position:0%
are a number of people who have come
 
06:36:55.868 --> 06:36:55.878 align:start position:0%
before these councils appeals are not
 
06:36:58.750 --> 06:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
constant I think the legislative intent
 
06:37:01.388 --> 06:37:01.398 align:start position:0%
early on perhaps was more for the
 
06:37:04.430 --> 06:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
applicants who had decisions which they
 
06:37:08.430 --> 06:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
found um perhaps unacceptable or perhaps
 
06:37:10.430 --> 06:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
needed to be modified to be sent back to
 
06:37:12.310 --> 06:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
Dees for further consideration I'm not
 
06:37:14.388 --> 06:37:14.398 align:start position:0%
sure that the process was set up for
 
06:37:16.990 --> 06:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
Citizens and members of the public uh in
 
06:37:17.000 --> 06:37:19.230 align:start position:0%
Citizens and members of the public uh in
affected

06:37:19.230 --> 06:37:19.240 align:start position:0%
affected
 
06:37:22.110 --> 06:37:22.120 align:start position:0%
communities so
 
06:37:24.868 --> 06:37:24.878 align:start position:0%
um I support this bill I mean I read it
 
06:37:27.590 --> 06:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
quickly this afternoon in principle in
 
06:37:29.510 --> 06:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
concept I think it would need some work
 
06:37:32.830 --> 06:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
um I think there's then a good comment
 
06:37:34.910 --> 06:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
made earlier by the chairman of another
 
06:37:38.548 --> 06:37:38.558 align:start position:0%
Council that um referring to courts is
 
06:37:41.190 --> 06:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps going to be a problem um these
 
06:37:44.948 --> 06:37:44.958 align:start position:0%
are sort of Quasi adjudicatory bodies
 
06:37:46.548 --> 06:37:46.558 align:start position:0%
they've got another role as well and
 
06:37:48.868 --> 06:37:48.878 align:start position:0%
that is to advise the department and the
 
06:37:50.990 --> 06:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner on policy
 
06:37:53.150 --> 06:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
development and they sort of got a
 
06:37:55.590 --> 06:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
public out Outreach role or in terms of
 
06:37:57.548 --> 06:37:57.558 align:start position:0%
education and that I just have not seen
 
06:37:58.830 --> 06:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
happening over the years and to the
 
06:38:01.070 --> 06:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
extent it does happen it certainly isn't
 
06:38:04.270 --> 06:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
happening at open meetings or in any way
 
06:38:06.628 --> 06:38:06.638 align:start position:0%
that is accessible to the public and
 
06:38:07.910 --> 06:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's been a real problem in New
 
06:38:09.548 --> 06:38:09.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in certain areas the
 
06:38:12.388 --> 06:38:12.398 align:start position:0%
department overseas uh where where
 
06:38:15.270 --> 06:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
policy is sort of stagnated not not in
 
06:38:17.070 --> 06:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
all areas and often you're responding to
 
06:38:18.750 --> 06:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
Federal requirements that are coming
 
06:38:21.468 --> 06:38:21.478 align:start position:0%
down from Congress or from EPA for
 
06:38:23.670 --> 06:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
example um in order to keep your funding
 
06:38:25.190 --> 06:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
streams going you've got to be in
 
06:38:26.590 --> 06:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
compliance to keep your state
 
06:38:28.830 --> 06:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
implementation plans in place for
 
06:38:28.840 --> 06:38:30.548 align:start position:0%
implementation plans in place for
example

06:38:30.548 --> 06:38:30.558 align:start position:0%
example
 
06:38:34.310 --> 06:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
um so you know and Rule rulle making
 
06:38:35.708 --> 06:38:35.718 align:start position:0%
obviously has to happen to keep
 
06:38:37.548 --> 06:38:37.558 align:start position:0%
adjusting the rules to stay in
 
06:38:40.548 --> 06:38:40.558 align:start position:0%
compliance that that's an important you
 
06:38:42.708 --> 06:38:42.718 align:start position:0%
know role for these councils but again I
 
06:38:45.750 --> 06:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
don't find that the the process
 
06:38:47.270 --> 06:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
currently used at least by the waste
 
06:38:49.030 --> 06:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
management Council and sometimes the air
 
06:38:51.230 --> 06:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
Resources Council is particularly
 
06:38:53.388 --> 06:38:53.398 align:start position:0%
transparent the rule is presented to
 
06:38:54.910 --> 06:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
them by St
 
06:38:57.948 --> 06:38:57.958 align:start position:0%
um and I think they're given a short
 
06:38:59.910 --> 06:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
period of time I don't recall exactly
 
06:39:01.910 --> 06:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps 15 days to get comments in and
 
06:39:03.910 --> 06:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
then there's a if there are comments or
 
06:39:06.270 --> 06:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
concerns there's a back and forth with
 
06:39:08.788 --> 06:39:08.798 align:start position:0%
members of Staff but that doesn't happen
 
06:39:11.388 --> 06:39:11.398 align:start position:0%
at an open meeting and that record of
 
06:39:14.948 --> 06:39:14.958 align:start position:0%
communications is not easy to obtain
 
06:39:16.388 --> 06:39:16.398 align:start position:0%
occasionally you can but you've got to
 
06:39:18.150 --> 06:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
dig for it you've got to know it's
 
06:39:21.350 --> 06:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
happening um and I I think that that
 
06:39:23.468 --> 06:39:23.478 align:start position:0%
needs to be looked at as well just the
 
06:39:25.750 --> 06:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
sort of the time frame that is used for
 
06:39:29.230 --> 06:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
receiving public comment from um from
 
06:39:31.708 --> 06:39:31.718 align:start position:0%
the agencies on these
 
06:39:34.788 --> 06:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
rules all right I'll stop there I'm sort
 
06:39:37.310 --> 06:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
of rambling on all right I do have I do
 
06:39:39.628 --> 06:39:39.638 align:start position:0%
have concerns and I really urge uh that
 
06:39:41.670 --> 06:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
we take a close look at at some pretty
 
06:39:43.830 --> 06:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
pretty substantial reform of this entire
 
06:39:45.830 --> 06:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
process thank you thank you questions
 
06:39:46.990 --> 06:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
for this
 
06:39:50.270 --> 06:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you uh is
 
06:39:52.150 --> 06:39:52.160 align:start position:0%

06:40:30.110 --> 06:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
may or may not be some State agencies
 
06:40:32.030 --> 06:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
testifying today I'm certainly in favor
 
06:40:34.030 --> 06:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
working with them um but I think
 
06:40:37.388 --> 06:40:37.398 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams outlined why
 
06:40:39.628 --> 06:40:39.638 align:start position:0%
we need in specific situations
 
06:40:42.030 --> 06:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
specifically related to housing why we
 
06:40:45.910 --> 06:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
need something to make it so that
 
06:40:48.070 --> 06:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
appeals to appeals of state agency are
 
06:40:50.310 --> 06:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
seen in an independent way and that they
 
06:40:53.510 --> 06:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
are done um when Common Sense should
 
06:40:56.388 --> 06:40:56.398 align:start position:0%
prevail it prevails so with that I'm
 
06:41:00.310 --> 06:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
just asking that you um listen to Dees
 
06:41:01.868 --> 06:41:01.878 align:start position:0%
and I've I've had I was supposed to have
 
06:41:04.310 --> 06:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
a meeting with them last Friday but um I
 
06:41:05.830 --> 06:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
had a family emergency so that didn't
 
06:41:07.948 --> 06:41:07.958 align:start position:0%
happen so um but we plan on working on
 
06:41:09.548 --> 06:41:09.558 align:start position:0%
an amendment to present to the committee
 
06:41:13.030 --> 06:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you all right questions for this
 
06:41:15.430 --> 06:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
witness all right thank you I seeing
 
06:41:18.628 --> 06:41:18.638 align:start position:0%
none all right um
 
06:41:21.830 --> 06:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh Adam crepo and Mr Brooks if you want
 
06:41:24.388 --> 06:41:24.398 align:start position:0%
to come up too since you know you you
 
06:41:26.350 --> 06:41:26.360 align:start position:0%
were sort of a tag team before and I
 
06:41:28.350 --> 06:41:28.360 align:start position:0%
think pretty effective so maybe you can
 
06:41:30.030 --> 06:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
do that
 
06:41:33.350 --> 06:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
again well thank you and just to clarify
 
06:41:34.750 --> 06:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh the Department of Justice does not
 
06:41:36.670 --> 06:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
take a position on this bill I think
 
06:41:40.070 --> 06:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
Dees May yeah so again uh just for the
 
06:41:42.230 --> 06:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
record uh members of the committee I'm
 
06:41:44.310 --> 06:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
Adam kpo I'm the assistant commissioner
 
06:41:46.670 --> 06:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
Dees I'll just give a brief overview of
 
06:41:49.868 --> 06:41:49.878 align:start position:0%
the uh of the testimony we submitted uh
 
06:41:51.830 --> 06:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
you know the we understand that the lack
 
06:41:53.788 --> 06:41:53.798 align:start position:0%
of housing Supply is one of the most
 
06:41:55.350 --> 06:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
important issues facing our state right
 
06:41:58.468 --> 06:41:58.478 align:start position:0%
now with that said we are neutral on uh
 
06:42:01.910 --> 06:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
HB HB 1602 with some notable concerns
 
06:42:04.468 --> 06:42:04.478 align:start position:0%
with the language um the legislation
 
06:42:06.388 --> 06:42:06.398 align:start position:0%
would appear to allow the housing
 
06:42:08.628 --> 06:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
appeals board to affirm reverse or
 
06:42:11.388 --> 06:42:11.398 align:start position:0%
modify decisions made by state agencies
 
06:42:13.868 --> 06:42:13.878 align:start position:0%
this is concerning because many of de's
 
06:42:15.270 --> 06:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
per uh permitting programs have a
 
06:42:17.788 --> 06:42:17.798 align:start position:0%
federal component associated with them
 
06:42:20.468 --> 06:42:20.478 align:start position:0%
in many cases EPA delegates authority to
 
06:42:23.468 --> 06:42:23.478 align:start position:0%
Dees to ensure Federal uh requirements
 
06:42:26.110 --> 06:42:26.120 align:start position:0%
are adhered to uh for example the state
 
06:42:27.510 --> 06:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
issues Wetlands permits and a
 
06:42:29.590 --> 06:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
modification made by the housing appeals
 
06:42:32.990 --> 06:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
board should this bill pass um could
 
06:42:34.830 --> 06:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
trigger the need to work with the Army
 
06:42:36.190 --> 06:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
Corps of Engineers to see if those
 
06:42:38.868 --> 06:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
changes are acceptable to them as there
 
06:42:41.070 --> 06:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
is of often a federal overlay with our
 
06:42:42.270 --> 06:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
per with those
 
06:42:42.280 --> 06:42:44.110 align:start position:0%
per with those
permits

06:42:44.110 --> 06:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
permits
 
06:42:46.788 --> 06:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
um if the housing appeals board modifies
 
06:42:48.468 --> 06:42:48.478 align:start position:0%
a Dees decision that has conditions
 
06:42:50.750 --> 06:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
required for federal compliance we would
 
06:42:52.750 --> 06:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
end up in a situation where applicants
 
06:42:54.388 --> 06:42:54.398 align:start position:0%
would be out of compliance with could be
 
06:42:56.150 --> 06:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
out of compliance with federal law
 
06:42:59.150 --> 06:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
depending on what they're modifying or
 
06:43:03.310 --> 06:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
reversing um as I I won't go into our
 
06:43:05.030 --> 06:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
our Council process I talked about our
 
06:43:06.430 --> 06:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
environmental councils on the last bill
 
06:43:09.230 --> 06:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
so you're well aware of that um Dees
 
06:43:10.270 --> 06:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
programs were designed by the
 
06:43:11.590 --> 06:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
legislature to be protective of the
 
06:43:13.190 --> 06:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
environment and public health so
 
06:43:15.948 --> 06:43:15.958 align:start position:0%
overriding a permit could have
 
06:43:20.388 --> 06:43:20.398 align:start position:0%
uh an ill ill intended result um you
 
06:43:22.670 --> 06:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
know for example the subsurface Bureau
 
06:43:24.310 --> 06:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
has been very successful at approving
 
06:43:26.030 --> 06:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
septic systems that protect drinking
 
06:43:28.388 --> 06:43:28.398 align:start position:0%
water wells we'd be concerned about the
 
06:43:29.948 --> 06:43:29.958 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board modifying or
 
06:43:31.468 --> 06:43:31.478 align:start position:0%
reversing a decision necessary to
 
06:43:35.510 --> 06:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
protect the public in public safety with
 
06:43:37.350 --> 06:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
all that said Dees is committed to
 
06:43:38.868 --> 06:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
creating efficiencies in the permitting
 
06:43:41.150 --> 06:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
process to ensure state agency uh
 
06:43:43.350 --> 06:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
decisions are timely and the conditions
 
06:43:45.230 --> 06:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
on those permits make sense from from an
 
06:43:48.230 --> 06:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
economic and environmental perspective
 
06:43:49.510 --> 06:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
um we'd be open to working with the
 
06:43:52.070 --> 06:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh as as he had mentioned uh we
 
06:43:53.628 --> 06:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
had a meeting last week we're in the
 
06:43:56.388 --> 06:43:56.398 align:start position:0%
process of rescheduling one um to find a
 
06:43:58.350 --> 06:43:58.360 align:start position:0%
path forward that address specific
 
06:44:01.310 --> 06:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
concerns um I'll just say it's my
 
06:44:02.708 --> 06:44:02.718 align:start position:0%
understanding that the the impetus for
 
06:44:06.070 --> 06:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
this bill may have come from um some of
 
06:44:08.110 --> 06:44:08.120 align:start position:0%
the concerns outlined at the special
 
06:44:10.628 --> 06:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
committee on housing uh that that the
 
06:44:14.948 --> 06:44:14.958 align:start position:0%
house um created and so um we we'd love
 
06:44:17.110 --> 06:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
to work with folks to figure out you
 
06:44:19.190 --> 06:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
know what what are the specific concerns
 
06:44:21.468 --> 06:44:21.478 align:start position:0%
how can we address them um without such
 
06:44:24.270 --> 06:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
a broad sweeping change so so that's
 
06:44:26.750 --> 06:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
that's where I'll leave
 
06:44:29.350 --> 06:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
it thank you and I'll Echo those
 
06:44:31.670 --> 06:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
sentiments um essentially yes we're very
 
06:44:33.548 --> 06:44:33.558 align:start position:0%
concerned about housing as well and we
 
06:44:35.070 --> 06:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate all the efforts to make
 
06:44:37.030 --> 06:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
things more streamlined we just wanted
 
06:44:39.510 --> 06:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
to raise people's uh awareness of how
 
06:44:41.910 --> 06:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
sweeping this relatively small word
 
06:44:45.468 --> 06:44:45.478 align:start position:0%
change would be and uh again example
 
06:44:46.750 --> 06:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
obviously you now know my background
 
06:44:48.150 --> 06:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
because I've been here for a
 
06:44:51.510 --> 06:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
while the legislature previously decided
 
06:44:53.548 --> 06:44:53.558 align:start position:0%
that in the environmental field that the
 
06:44:54.750 --> 06:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
issues were so complex that they
 
06:44:56.750 --> 06:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't even be reviewed by one Council
 
06:44:58.468 --> 06:44:58.478 align:start position:0%
they needed four councils those councils
 
06:45:00.350 --> 06:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
have expertise they do this for a long
 
06:45:04.190 --> 06:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
time the issues in my field are very
 
06:45:05.948 --> 06:45:05.958 align:start position:0%
complicated again hearings last between
 
06:45:07.628 --> 06:45:07.638 align:start position:0%
two and four days and they're very
 
06:45:09.670 --> 06:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
technical very
 
06:45:12.270 --> 06:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
specialized uh air program I'd say is
 
06:45:15.150 --> 06:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
the most so waste um following close
 
06:45:16.868 --> 06:45:16.878 align:start position:0%
behind but for instance an air permit
 
06:45:18.388 --> 06:45:18.398 align:start position:0%
Title Five permit probably among the
 
06:45:20.310 --> 06:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
most complicated permits you could
 
06:45:23.230 --> 06:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
have that is a Clean Air Act requirement
 
06:45:24.628 --> 06:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
you you don't have to go to the federal
 
06:45:25.788 --> 06:45:25.798 align:start position:0%
government right now to get those
 
06:45:27.548 --> 06:45:27.558 align:start position:0%
permits because you can get them from E
 
06:45:30.070 --> 06:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
from uh Dees but that's because Dees is
 
06:45:33.830 --> 06:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
a delegated program under EPA if they
 
06:45:35.270 --> 06:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
lose that
 
06:45:37.590 --> 06:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
delegation then you'll get a Dees permit
 
06:45:39.070 --> 06:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
and you have to go to EPA to get a
 
06:45:40.310 --> 06:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
separate permit and it's very
 
06:45:41.910 --> 06:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
complicated and so you want to make sure
 
06:45:44.628 --> 06:45:44.638 align:start position:0%
that you don't end up impeding something
 
06:45:46.150 --> 06:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
where we have a good relationship and
 
06:45:48.548 --> 06:45:48.558 align:start position:0%
we're able to provide uh those Services
 
06:45:50.990 --> 06:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh faster so I again would applaud any
 
06:45:53.670 --> 06:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
effort to continue talking uh about this
 
06:45:55.628 --> 06:45:55.638 align:start position:0%
issues and kind of synergize what a
 
06:45:58.788 --> 06:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
solution might be questions for this for
 
06:46:01.430 --> 06:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
the either of these Witnesses so let me
 
06:46:04.070 --> 06:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
just ask one qu I
 
06:46:07.190 --> 06:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
mean one of the I guess I have two
 
06:46:11.510 --> 06:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
concerns one is if we were to allow the
 
06:46:15.510 --> 06:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board to have some
 
06:46:18.868 --> 06:46:18.878 align:start position:0%
review authority over decisions of the
 
06:46:21.190 --> 06:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental
 
06:46:25.388 --> 06:46:25.398 align:start position:0%
Services would that review
 
06:46:27.868 --> 06:46:27.878 align:start position:0%
would the housing appeals board
 
06:46:29.948 --> 06:46:29.958 align:start position:0%
replace I mean would would would your
 
06:46:31.830 --> 06:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
view be that that the housing appeals
 
06:46:35.590 --> 06:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
board should replace the councils
 
06:46:41.350 --> 06:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
or should the should the review go from
 
06:46:44.230 --> 06:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
Dees to the councils to the housing
 
06:46:46.590 --> 06:46:46.600 align:start position:0%
appeals board and then to the Supreme
 
06:46:49.468 --> 06:46:49.478 align:start position:0%
Court and if that I guess my concern
 
06:46:51.910 --> 06:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
would be if that were the were the case
 
06:46:54.070 --> 06:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure we've added yet one more
 
06:46:56.868 --> 06:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
layer of appeal I'm not sure how that
 
06:47:01.388 --> 06:47:01.398 align:start position:0%
furthers you know um uh moving forward
 
06:47:03.990 --> 06:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
with housing uh and meeting the the
 
06:47:06.910 --> 06:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
current situation so uh the way I look
 
06:47:08.388 --> 06:47:08.398 align:start position:0%
at this bill it applies to All State
 
06:47:11.628 --> 06:47:11.638 align:start position:0%
agencies not just Dees so um you know
 
06:47:14.830 --> 06:47:14.840 align:start position:0%
think about a DOT driveway permit or
 
06:47:16.708 --> 06:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
some other you know permit you might
 
06:47:18.670 --> 06:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
need to get from uh the Department of
 
06:47:20.030 --> 06:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
Natural and cultural resources or
 
06:47:24.350 --> 06:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
something like that um so I I think that
 
06:47:25.708 --> 06:47:25.718 align:start position:0%
kind of speaks to your question a little
 
06:47:28.788 --> 06:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
bit but I'm not sure that I think it
 
06:47:31.310 --> 06:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
might create a separate path Alan do you
 
06:47:32.788 --> 06:47:32.798 align:start position:0%
have any thoughts on
 
06:47:35.110 --> 06:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
that it would be very
 
06:47:37.230 --> 06:47:37.240 align:start position:0%
concerning for me to have either of the
 
06:47:39.270 --> 06:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
two things that you just described occur
 
06:47:40.788 --> 06:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
either to have a housing appeals board
 
06:47:42.830 --> 06:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
without the expertise replace the
 
06:47:46.310 --> 06:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
councils or to have an additional layer
 
06:47:48.510 --> 06:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
of appeal those things I don't know the
 
06:47:50.830 --> 06:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board the the councils
 
06:47:52.468 --> 06:47:52.478 align:start position:0%
by necessity just to give people Fair
 
06:47:53.948 --> 06:47:53.958 align:start position:0%
notice and ability to get things
 
06:47:56.070 --> 06:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
together and to get to a hearing and be
 
06:47:59.070 --> 06:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
heard takes a long time so um I would be
 
06:48:00.590 --> 06:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
very concerned about that and again
 
06:48:01.708 --> 06:48:01.718 align:start position:0%
obviously it doesn't just affect
 
06:48:02.990 --> 06:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services one of the ones
 
06:48:05.030 --> 06:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
that came to my mind uh was Health and
 
06:48:06.948 --> 06:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
Human Services right so if there's lead
 
06:48:08.230 --> 06:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
paint in the building or something else
 
06:48:10.350 --> 06:48:10.360 align:start position:0%
and they have to issue an order should
 
06:48:12.708 --> 06:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board really be
 
06:48:14.510 --> 06:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
reviewing that it's just something to
 
06:48:16.388 --> 06:48:16.398 align:start position:0%
make sure that you're thinking about as
 
06:48:18.110 --> 06:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
you're considering what this bill might
 
06:48:20.548 --> 06:48:20.558 align:start position:0%
do I wonder if if I could ask just one
 
06:48:22.788 --> 06:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
other question I mean that what you just
 
06:48:25.110 --> 06:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
raised is the the thing that actually
 
06:48:26.230 --> 06:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
persuaded me that we should have a
 
06:48:28.868 --> 06:48:28.878 align:start position:0%
second hearing on this is at the at the
 
06:48:32.388 --> 06:48:32.398 align:start position:0%
last hearing we we heard from uh what I
 
06:48:34.150 --> 06:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
think were very legitimate concerns from
 
06:48:36.510 --> 06:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission about how
 
06:48:38.468 --> 06:48:38.478 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission might be
 
06:48:41.110 --> 06:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
implic might be impacted by by this and
 
06:48:43.830 --> 06:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
I have to say candidly I had never you
 
06:48:47.030 --> 06:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
know the idea that that that that um
 
06:48:48.430 --> 06:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
that the housing appeals board might
 
06:48:52.110 --> 06:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
have some role in that uh in in you know
 
06:48:53.788 --> 06:48:53.798 align:start position:0%
reviewing decision of of the Human
 
06:48:55.548 --> 06:48:55.558 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission was I it just hadn't
 
06:48:57.510 --> 06:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
occurred to me but I think they raised a
 
06:49:00.070 --> 06:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
legitimate Point we've now talked about
 
06:49:01.590 --> 06:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
06:49:03.670 --> 06:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
and Department of Transportation you
 
06:49:04.990 --> 06:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
raised the Department of Health and
 
06:49:07.230 --> 06:49:07.240 align:start position:0%
Human Services what I what I guess I'm
 
06:49:09.990 --> 06:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
asking is would it be possible for the
 
06:49:13.830 --> 06:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice to provide the
 
06:49:17.750 --> 06:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
committee with a complete listing of you
 
06:49:17.760 --> 06:49:18.708 align:start position:0%
committee with a complete listing of you
know

06:49:18.708 --> 06:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:49:22.230 --> 06:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
any any state agency that potentially
 
06:49:23.910 --> 06:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
could have
 
06:49:26.670 --> 06:49:26.680 align:start position:0%
some role in housing that would be
 
06:49:29.150 --> 06:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
subject to their decisions would be
 
06:49:30.868 --> 06:49:30.878 align:start position:0%
subject to review by the housing appeals
 
06:49:34.548 --> 06:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
board if we were to adopt this this bill
 
06:49:37.430 --> 06:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
or some version of it I'd be happy to
 
06:49:38.910 --> 06:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
take that question back I can't tell you
 
06:49:40.788 --> 06:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
right now uh the Civil Bureau has a list
 
06:49:42.388 --> 06:49:42.398 align:start position:0%
of all their civil Bureau clients we
 
06:49:44.230 --> 06:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
have you know Department of energy that
 
06:49:46.190 --> 06:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
may be impacted I suppose Environmental
 
06:49:48.030 --> 06:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
Services fishing game that may be
 
06:49:49.590 --> 06:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
impacted if you want to develop housing
 
06:49:50.628 --> 06:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
where there's threatened dangered
 
06:49:53.548 --> 06:49:53.558 align:start position:0%
species Etc that's just for my Bureau um
 
06:49:55.110 --> 06:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
I mentioned Health and Human Services
 
06:49:57.110 --> 06:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
but they my at the last count I bet
 
06:50:00.310 --> 06:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
there's more than a hundred uh agencies
 
06:50:03.190 --> 06:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
that have some level of counseling that
 
06:50:04.708 --> 06:50:04.718 align:start position:0%
they get from the Civil Bureau and I'd
 
06:50:07.030 --> 06:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
have to ask them um you know who could
 
06:50:07.040 --> 06:50:07.868 align:start position:0%
have to ask them um you know who could
be

06:50:07.868 --> 06:50:07.878 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:50:10.270 --> 06:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
affected I would be very interested to
 
06:50:11.990 --> 06:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
hear what the housing appeals board
 
06:50:16.708 --> 06:50:16.718 align:start position:0%
would say about uh us us saying here's
 
06:50:18.948 --> 06:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
your new jurisdiction is that you have
 
06:50:21.548 --> 06:50:21.558 align:start position:0%
the planning board zoning boards and 100
 
06:50:23.750 --> 06:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
state agencies or I think they might
 
06:50:25.548 --> 06:50:25.558 align:start position:0%
have some they might have something to
 
06:50:27.868 --> 06:50:27.878 align:start position:0%
say about that I would think Mr chair Mr
 
06:50:29.350 --> 06:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
chair they did say something about it
 
06:50:30.628 --> 06:50:30.638 align:start position:0%
and they said that they support the bill
 
06:50:30.638 --> 06:50:32.468 align:start position:0%
and they said that they support the bill
as

06:50:32.468 --> 06:50:32.478 align:start position:0%
as
 
06:50:35.030 --> 06:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
written these all of these
 
06:50:37.270 --> 06:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
agencies at the last public hearing they
 
06:50:39.070 --> 06:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
said they didn't think there would be a
 
06:50:41.110 --> 06:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
whole lot of cases amounting from this
 
06:50:42.430 --> 06:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
and they said that they support it as
 
06:50:45.628 --> 06:50:45.638 align:start position:0%
written okay all
 
06:50:47.990 --> 06:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
right any other questions for this
 
06:50:50.070 --> 06:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
witness I'm not sure that I remember
 
06:50:54.310 --> 06:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
that yes representative Andrew
 
06:50:55.788 --> 06:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:50:59.230 --> 06:50:59.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question my concern is with
 
06:51:01.750 --> 06:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals
 
06:51:04.788 --> 06:51:04.798 align:start position:0%
board have the
 
06:51:07.548 --> 06:51:07.558 align:start position:0%
expertise that Wetlands or somebody in
 
06:51:10.788 --> 06:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
DS had in DS
 
06:51:14.030 --> 06:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
has would they be able to go through an
 
06:51:17.868 --> 06:51:17.878 align:start position:0%
application and answer all the questions
 
06:51:20.270 --> 06:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
that might come up I
 
06:51:24.350 --> 06:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
mean I know Dees has has to have experts
 
06:51:27.070 --> 06:51:27.080 align:start position:0%
here here and here is this house appeals
 
06:51:29.590 --> 06:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
board going to have that expertise is my
 
06:51:32.590 --> 06:51:32.600 align:start position:0%
question and I presume representative
 
06:51:34.150 --> 06:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
Alexander could tell you more about that
 
06:51:35.750 --> 06:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
board but what I can tell you about the
 
06:51:37.868 --> 06:51:37.878 align:start position:0%
councils that we have is they're
 
06:51:40.310 --> 06:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
specifically set up with the
 
06:51:42.388 --> 06:51:42.398 align:start position:0%
understanding that probably not any one
 
06:51:44.670 --> 06:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
of them would have even enough expertise
 
06:51:46.230 --> 06:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
to decide so it's chosen to be okay
 
06:51:48.110 --> 06:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
let's have one person from fishing game
 
06:51:50.230 --> 06:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
one person from do and then specifically
 
06:51:51.628 --> 06:51:51.638 align:start position:0%
somebody who works in that industry
 
06:51:52.868 --> 06:51:52.878 align:start position:0%
someone who has certain years of exper
 
06:51:55.830 --> 06:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
experience Etc who can actually bring
 
06:51:58.270 --> 06:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
something to the table with specific
 
06:52:00.230 --> 06:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
background on all of those topics that's
 
06:52:02.750 --> 06:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
how the council's
 
06:52:05.310 --> 06:52:05.320 align:start position:0%
function other questions for this either
 
06:52:07.350 --> 06:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
of these Witnesses seeing none thank you
 
06:52:18.948 --> 06:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:22.548 --> 06:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
Kimble good afternoon just a couple of
 
06:52:25.628 --> 06:52:25.638 align:start position:0%
quick comments here first in in response
 
06:52:28.788 --> 06:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
to the comment on the federal um overlay
 
06:52:30.510 --> 06:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
situation just want to make it clear
 
06:52:34.110 --> 06:52:34.120 align:start position:0%
that one of the best things that Dees
 
06:52:35.708 --> 06:52:35.718 align:start position:0%
does for the citizens of State of New
 
06:52:39.190 --> 06:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is in the case of the Clean
 
06:52:41.310 --> 06:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
Water Act they protect the people of New
 
06:52:43.270 --> 06:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from having to go before the
 
06:52:45.030 --> 06:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
Army Corps of Engineers because if you
 
06:52:48.510 --> 06:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
get a New Hampshire permit or Wetlands
 
06:52:51.190 --> 06:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
you have generally except for very large
 
06:52:53.388 --> 06:52:53.398 align:start position:0%
projects met the requ requirements of
 
06:52:56.030 --> 06:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
the clean Clean Water Act and and as
 
06:52:57.788 --> 06:52:57.798 align:start position:0%
they mentioned there's some other areas
 
06:52:59.788 --> 06:52:59.798 align:start position:0%
that we do that so we don't want to
 
06:53:03.830 --> 06:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
touch that um our our question reading
 
06:53:06.230 --> 06:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
this is just how in the world does this
 
06:53:09.110 --> 06:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
work what is a housing project is that a
 
06:53:12.270 --> 06:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
single family who has gotten a culvert
 
06:53:15.708 --> 06:53:15.718 align:start position:0%
permit who the abutter objects to and
 
06:53:18.230 --> 06:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
what happens if one AB butter objects to
 
06:53:19.910 --> 06:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
it and appeals to the housing appeals
 
06:53:21.750 --> 06:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
board and the other butter objects to it
 
06:53:23.310 --> 06:53:23.320 align:start position:0%
and appeals to the Wetland
 
06:53:26.548 --> 06:53:26.558 align:start position:0%
Council if they still have that right um
 
06:53:28.468 --> 06:53:28.478 align:start position:0%
so that would need to be
 
06:53:31.750 --> 06:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
clarified um another thing is there
 
06:53:34.510 --> 06:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
seems to be a possible standing conflict
 
06:53:37.270 --> 06:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
here they're referring to standing in
 
06:53:39.548 --> 06:53:39.558 align:start position:0%
from 6774 and
 
06:53:42.830 --> 06:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
6775 that doesn't necessarily consistent
 
06:53:44.310 --> 06:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
with the standing that we have in the
 
06:53:46.350 --> 06:53:46.360 align:start position:0%
Shoreland and Wetland I don't know about
 
06:53:48.510 --> 06:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
some of the other Dees programs or
 
06:53:50.270 --> 06:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
anyone else's any other
 
06:53:55.270 --> 06:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
agencies um and so the question is if if
 
06:53:59.150 --> 06:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
one person appeals to the housing
 
06:54:02.150 --> 06:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
appeals board and there are other
 
06:54:03.990 --> 06:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
appeals to all sorts of other agencies
 
06:54:05.910 --> 06:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
does that mean the whole kitten Kaboodle
 
06:54:08.150 --> 06:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
goes to the housing appeals board or do
 
06:54:12.868 --> 06:54:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:16.030 --> 06:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
on and I guess I I'll just say that from
 
06:54:18.548 --> 06:54:18.558 align:start position:0%
our experience at the wetlands we don't
 
06:54:20.750 --> 06:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
have a lot of what I would call housing
 
06:54:22.430 --> 06:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
housing appeals the kinds that I just
 
06:54:24.468 --> 06:54:24.478 align:start position:0%
mentioned mentioned or
 
06:54:27.548 --> 06:54:27.558 align:start position:0%
subdivisions types of housing appeals
 
06:54:29.948 --> 06:54:29.958 align:start position:0%
but when we have them it's always Dees
 
06:54:32.468 --> 06:54:32.478 align:start position:0%
has given them the permit and people are
 
06:54:34.230 --> 06:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
trying to stop the project whether it's
 
06:54:37.030 --> 06:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
a single family home or whether it's a
 
06:54:40.030 --> 06:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
subdivision and what we need to be
 
06:54:43.030 --> 06:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about is I'm very concerned
 
06:54:46.070 --> 06:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
about the the permites because we have
 
06:54:48.430 --> 06:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
what I call motion sickness in this
 
06:54:51.030 --> 06:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
whole process which is that people want
 
06:54:53.910 --> 06:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
to stop at keep issuing motions getting
 
06:54:57.110 --> 06:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
objections waiting for decisions blah
 
06:55:00.230 --> 06:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
you know on and on and so we need to
 
06:55:04.270 --> 06:55:04.280 align:start position:0%
look at the pathways and see which one
 
06:55:06.990 --> 06:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
is the shortest to solve the housing
 
06:55:09.388 --> 06:55:09.398 align:start position:0%
these housing problems um and if we're
 
06:55:11.468 --> 06:55:11.478 align:start position:0%
longer I I you know if the councils are
 
06:55:13.788 --> 06:55:13.798 align:start position:0%
the longest process and maybe we should
 
06:55:15.868 --> 06:55:15.878 align:start position:0%
give it to somebody who's faster Well
 
06:55:17.388 --> 06:55:17.398 align:start position:0%
we'd like to be faster too that's what
 
06:55:19.830 --> 06:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
the study committee is about but I think
 
06:55:21.910 --> 06:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
that's what you need to look at so all
 
06:55:24.548 --> 06:55:24.558 align:start position:0%
right question questions for this
 
06:55:30.628 --> 06:55:30.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:34.230 --> 06:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
much uh let's see there was
 
06:55:37.670 --> 06:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh from the on from the online signin
 
06:55:40.670 --> 06:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
there was no support and 30 opposed to
 
06:55:43.788 --> 06:55:43.798 align:start position:0%
the bill nobody neutral um is there
 
06:55:46.830 --> 06:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wishes to be heard on uh
 
06:55:51.510 --> 06:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:51.520 --> 06:55:58.948 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:55:58.948 --> 06:55:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:01.070 --> 06:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I wasn't sure
 
06:56:02.628 --> 06:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
if I was going to testify I will put in
 
06:56:05.070 --> 06:56:05.080 align:start position:0%
a pink card Ben Frost uh New Hampshire
 
06:56:08.990 --> 06:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
housing um at the first public hearing
 
06:56:11.590 --> 06:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
on this bill I after after the hearing
 
06:56:13.230 --> 06:56:13.240 align:start position:0%
closed you charged me with coming up
 
06:56:16.590 --> 06:56:16.600 align:start position:0%
with an amendment um and I have done
 
06:56:19.590 --> 06:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
part of that uh recognizing that we
 
06:56:22.788 --> 06:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
would hear from uh folks from Dees and I
 
06:56:25.468 --> 06:56:25.478 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure how to address that um have
 
06:56:27.750 --> 06:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
some ideas but it's not drafted I do
 
06:56:30.430 --> 06:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
have an amendment drafted that um
 
06:56:34.830 --> 06:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
addresses the concerns raised by the uh
 
06:56:37.030 --> 06:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh building officials Association Mr
 
06:56:39.510 --> 06:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
Sherman and Mr McKinny both testified
 
06:56:41.590 --> 06:56:41.600 align:start position:0%
and expressed concerns I drafted
 
06:56:44.270 --> 06:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
something and uh they told me this
 
06:56:45.948 --> 06:56:45.958 align:start position:0%
morning by email that they were okay
 
06:56:48.510 --> 06:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
with this um so that's that's good news
 
06:56:51.350 --> 06:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
and I also Incorporated the amendment uh
 
06:56:53.310 --> 06:56:53.320 align:start position:0%
proferred by representative Gibbs that
 
06:56:55.110 --> 06:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
06:56:55.120 --> 06:56:56.948 align:start position:0%
was uh
20242

06:56:56.948 --> 06:56:56.958 align:start position:0%
20242
 
06:57:00.590 --> 06:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
31h um happy to I only have one copy I'm

uh to you as well um and likewise I'm
 
06:57:08.590 --> 06:57:08.600 align:start position:0%
happy to work with the committee and
 
06:57:10.628 --> 06:57:10.638 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor and with uh the
 
06:57:12.388 --> 06:57:12.398 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services and
 
06:57:15.070 --> 06:57:15.080 align:start position:0%
anyone else on amendments to this happy
 
06:57:16.990 --> 06:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
to take any questions right questions
 
06:57:18.590 --> 06:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
for this um
 
06:57:21.070 --> 06:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
witness well no thank I thank you very
 
06:57:23.388 --> 06:57:23.398 align:start position:0%
much for your efforts on this and and I
 
06:57:25.990 --> 06:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
um you know I
 
06:57:28.510 --> 06:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
there's speaking personally I would like
 
06:57:30.868 --> 06:57:30.878 align:start position:0%
to see this bill be able to move forward
 
06:57:33.670 --> 06:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
but I for the various reasons that we've
 
06:57:35.310 --> 06:57:35.320 align:start position:0%
all seen I think
 
06:57:38.150 --> 06:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
there's there are very legitimate
 
06:57:40.270 --> 06:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
concerns about you know what exactly
 
06:57:43.590 --> 06:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
should be the scope of the uh of the
 
06:57:45.230 --> 06:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
what exactly should go to the housing
 
06:57:46.830 --> 06:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
appeals board and what should not
 
06:57:49.708 --> 06:57:49.718 align:start position:0%
correct and and Mr chairman I I I had a
 
06:57:51.310 --> 06:57:51.320 align:start position:0%
question that the committee might wish
 
06:57:53.830 --> 06:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
to ask uh Dees or the Department of
 
06:57:57.110 --> 06:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
Justice uh and that my question was how
 
06:58:00.030 --> 06:58:00.040 align:start position:0%
are the federal overlays
 
06:58:04.230 --> 06:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
protected in the appeals to the councils
 
06:58:07.270 --> 06:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
and to the Supreme Court uh in a way
 
06:58:08.948 --> 06:58:08.958 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't be protected in an
 
06:58:10.670 --> 06:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
appeal to the housing appeals
 
06:58:12.868 --> 06:58:12.878 align:start position:0%
board sure that is an excellent question
 
06:58:14.990 --> 06:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
I wonder if we could just ask gentleman
 
06:58:17.430 --> 06:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
if you could uh that's that is a very
 
06:58:21.310 --> 06:58:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:21.320 --> 06:58:26.350 align:start position:0%
 
think

06:58:26.350 --> 06:58:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:28.468 --> 06:58:28.478 align:start position:0%
thank you so they're not sacred uh it's
 
06:58:30.788 --> 06:58:30.798 align:start position:0%
not to say that either department or U
 
06:58:32.150 --> 06:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
the council could make a decision that
 
06:58:34.670 --> 06:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
was wrong but the protection is simply
 
06:58:37.310 --> 06:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
the expertise and the familiarity so for
 
06:58:39.070 --> 06:58:39.080 align:start position:0%
instance if you're on the air Council
 
06:58:40.350 --> 06:58:40.360 align:start position:0%
you and you've been there for some
 
06:58:42.708 --> 06:58:42.718 align:start position:0%
amount of time you understand exactly
 
06:58:44.910 --> 06:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
how that Federal program works and to
 
06:58:47.230 --> 06:58:47.240 align:start position:0%
say wait we can't change these
 
06:58:48.510 --> 06:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
requirements because these come from the
 
06:58:49.750 --> 06:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
Clean Air Act you know how they
 
06:58:51.990 --> 06:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
intertwine you know what if you're on
 
06:58:55.110 --> 06:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
the Council and I'm sure um chairman
 
06:58:56.388 --> 06:58:56.398 align:start position:0%
Kimble could tell you this that he has
 
06:58:58.070 --> 06:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
great familiarity with
 
06:59:00.788 --> 06:59:00.798 align:start position:0%
this is what is the state programmatic
 
06:59:02.310 --> 06:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
general permit like okay that's the
 
06:59:04.910 --> 06:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
permit that the Army Corps gives the
 
06:59:08.430 --> 06:59:08.440 align:start position:0%
state in total that says so long as you
 
06:59:10.990 --> 06:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
get a uh State weling permit that
 
06:59:13.510 --> 06:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
satisfies ab and C you do meet the sgpp
 
06:59:14.910 --> 06:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
maybe some big projects come out and
 
06:59:17.270 --> 06:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
here's how that happens the people on
 
06:59:18.708 --> 06:59:18.718 align:start position:0%
the councils are actually quite familiar
 
06:59:20.948 --> 06:59:20.958 align:start position:0%
with how that works they tread lightly
 
06:59:23.868 --> 06:59:23.878 align:start position:0%
on that and they um they understand how
 
06:59:25.468 --> 06:59:25.478 align:start position:0%
the framework works so the only
 
06:59:26.910 --> 06:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
protection I would say is expertise
 
06:59:29.070 --> 06:59:29.080 align:start position:0%
there's no specific thing that says
 
06:59:30.670 --> 06:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
anyone could not make a decision that
 
06:59:30.680 --> 06:59:31.830 align:start position:0%
anyone could not make a decision that
was

06:59:31.830 --> 06:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:59:34.990 --> 06:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
incorrect okay so can I just follow up
 
06:59:38.708 --> 06:59:38.718 align:start position:0%
on one question on that so if
 
06:59:42.270 --> 06:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
um am I understanding correctly that in
 
06:59:45.230 --> 06:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
other words if the depart if the core of
 
06:59:49.388 --> 06:59:49.398 align:start position:0%
engineers gives the authority to Dees to
 
06:59:53.910 --> 06:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
issue some permits uh some you know
 
06:59:57.350 --> 06:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
permits that you've talked about um if
 
06:59:59.230 --> 06:59:59.240 align:start position:0%
the if
 
07:00:02.708 --> 07:00:02.718 align:start position:0%
Dees issues
 
07:00:07.070 --> 07:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
those in a particular case that is that
 
07:00:08.628 --> 07:00:08.638 align:start position:0%
you know the federal government doesn't
 
07:00:11.030 --> 07:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
like they think that it somehow violates
 
07:00:14.548 --> 07:00:14.558 align:start position:0%
the the federal law but Dees doesn't
 
07:00:16.788 --> 07:00:16.798 align:start position:0%
think that issues the permit it goes to
 
07:00:18.910 --> 07:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
the wetlands Council the wetlands
 
07:00:21.788 --> 07:00:21.798 align:start position:0%
Council affirms it goes to the Supreme
 
07:00:23.910 --> 07:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
Court the Supreme Court
 
07:00:27.830 --> 07:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
affirms then what is what is the what
 
07:00:30.110 --> 07:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
does the core of engineers do about that
 
07:00:31.830 --> 07:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
appeal to the Supreme Court US Supreme
 
07:00:34.510 --> 07:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
Court or it's more of a practical matter
 
07:00:35.750 --> 07:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of layers to it and
 
07:00:37.030 --> 07:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different ways that
 
07:00:39.548 --> 07:00:39.558 align:start position:0%
programs get delegated So Clean Air Act
 
07:00:41.510 --> 07:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
program is delegated by letter basically
 
07:00:44.430 --> 07:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
that says the state can do it so for
 
07:00:47.150 --> 07:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
Clean Air Act EPA can do what's called
 
07:00:49.070 --> 07:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
over file on a particular case and they
 
07:00:50.868 --> 07:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
can say we don't think we agree with
 
07:00:52.150 --> 07:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
what you did and we'll have the ad admin
 
07:00:54.150 --> 07:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
istrator vpa take an independent action
 
07:00:56.708 --> 07:00:56.718 align:start position:0%
but behind that action is you may get
 
07:00:58.750 --> 07:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
decertified uh as a state and then you
 
07:01:00.230 --> 07:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be allowed to do that there's
 
07:01:03.310 --> 07:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
also grant funding in play SG um I think
 
07:01:04.868 --> 07:01:04.878 align:start position:0%
it's now just general permit but the the
 
07:01:06.190 --> 07:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
Army Corps permit is a little bit
 
07:01:07.750 --> 07:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
different in process so the Army Corps
 
07:01:09.468 --> 07:01:09.478 align:start position:0%
has the ability in the permit to pull
 
07:01:12.030 --> 07:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
out any project that it thinks is
 
07:01:14.468 --> 07:01:14.478 align:start position:0%
actually not fulfilling the uh Army
 
07:01:16.070 --> 07:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
Corps requirements because the idea is
 
07:01:18.190 --> 07:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
that our state program is restrictive
 
07:01:20.310 --> 07:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
enough protective enough that if you
 
07:01:22.270 --> 07:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
meet the state you will meet the feds
 
07:01:24.070 --> 07:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
they have the the ability to pull that
 
07:01:26.910 --> 07:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
out but the program will look at it and
 
07:01:30.670 --> 07:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
say do you actually deserve to have your
 
07:01:33.110 --> 07:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
general permit reissued or are we going
 
07:01:34.510 --> 07:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
to be doing individual permits for
 
07:01:36.310 --> 07:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
everybody in the state of New Hampshire
 
07:01:38.628 --> 07:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
because you're not able to do it and
 
07:01:40.030 --> 07:01:40.040 align:start position:0%
there's probably three other ways that
 
07:01:41.430 --> 07:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
things get delegated but it's
 
07:01:42.670 --> 07:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
essentially comes down to are you going
 
07:01:44.350 --> 07:01:44.360 align:start position:0%
to be allowed to keep doing it and are
 
07:01:46.270 --> 07:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
you going to get the funding that goes
 
07:01:49.110 --> 07:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
along with some of those things thank
 
07:01:49.120 --> 07:01:50.350 align:start position:0%
along with some of those things thank
you

07:01:50.350 --> 07:01:50.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:01:53.548 --> 07:01:53.558 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee no
 
07:01:55.230 --> 07:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
represent representative WS thank you
 
07:01:57.548 --> 07:01:57.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question would
 
07:02:00.788 --> 07:02:00.798 align:start position:0%
um would an amendment such that um the
 
07:02:02.708 --> 07:02:02.718 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board would not be able
 
07:02:05.990 --> 07:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
to reconsider any any uh decisions that
 
07:02:09.670 --> 07:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
involve perming um involving Army Core
 
07:02:12.110 --> 07:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
of Engineers you know so Shoreland um
 
07:02:15.230 --> 07:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
The Heritage uh you know all the other
 
07:02:16.830 --> 07:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
Provisions you've got to do in the uh
 
07:02:19.788 --> 07:02:19.798 align:start position:0%
the Clean Air Act if we carve those out
 
07:02:21.670 --> 07:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
of this process would that give us
 
07:02:23.430 --> 07:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
enough protection to allow this to go
 
07:02:26.030 --> 07:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
forward as to not be metalsome in those
 
07:02:28.070 --> 07:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
types of permits yeah and thank you I
 
07:02:29.910 --> 07:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
didn't mean to seem too anxious to leave
 
07:02:31.670 --> 07:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
you seem like very nice people stay as
 
07:02:36.030 --> 07:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
long as you want um I I would say that
 
07:02:37.548 --> 07:02:37.558 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how many carats you would
 
07:02:39.350 --> 07:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
need I provided you some examples I'm
 
07:02:41.030 --> 07:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
not sure if the carats start to be so
 
07:02:42.628 --> 07:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
cumbersome that it's very hard to
 
07:02:43.830 --> 07:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
understand and everything that you need
 
07:02:48.430 --> 07:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
to do um I think that I would be
 
07:02:52.070 --> 07:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
interested in you know this kind of the
 
07:02:53.990 --> 07:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
meritorious idea of making sure people
 
07:02:55.230 --> 07:02:55.240 align:start position:0%
have access to housing and everything
 
07:02:56.830 --> 07:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
else that might go along with it to say
 
07:02:58.590 --> 07:02:58.600 align:start position:0%
what do you need to achieve and then how
 
07:03:00.510 --> 07:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
can we change it to focus on what needs
 
07:03:02.990 --> 07:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
to be done rather than having a very
 
07:03:05.910 --> 07:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
broad uh provision with many many car
 
07:03:09.150 --> 07:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
VES great thank you other
 
07:03:11.708 --> 07:03:11.718 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
07:03:14.510 --> 07:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
much anyone else who wishes to be heard
 
07:03:17.070 --> 07:03:17.080 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
07:03:19.750 --> 07:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
1602 seeing none I'm going to close the
 
07:03:22.910 --> 07:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 1602
 
07:03:25.150 --> 07:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
yeah yes
 
07:03:29.990 --> 07:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
before you end this session um I've just
 
07:03:32.548 --> 07:03:32.558 align:start position:0%
realized that our colleague
 
07:03:36.030 --> 07:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
representative steton has um a floor
 
07:03:37.910 --> 07:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment on
 
07:03:42.230 --> 07:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
1589 that um looks long and
 
07:03:45.750 --> 07:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
complicated and I wondered if it
 
07:03:49.388 --> 07:03:49.398 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate for him to just
 
07:03:52.070 --> 07:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
quickly tell us what the differences are
 
07:03:53.708 --> 07:03:53.718 align:start position:0%
since we're going to have to vote on
 
07:03:57.230 --> 07:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
that tomorrow no no not 158 1589 is the
 
07:03:58.990 --> 07:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
Veterans that's that's going to that's
 
07:04:00.468 --> 07:04:00.478 align:start position:0%
going oh you're talking about going it's
 
07:04:02.830 --> 07:04:02.840 align:start position:0%
going to go to the floor that's cor sure
 
07:04:04.350 --> 07:04:04.360 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah no I'm sorry yes yeah
 
07:04:06.430 --> 07:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
that's correct that's why I'm concerned
 
07:04:06.440 --> 07:04:07.350 align:start position:0%
that's correct that's why I'm concerned
okay

07:04:07.350 --> 07:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:04:10.830 --> 07:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
sure yeah it multiple pages and I'm
 
07:04:13.270 --> 07:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
sorry for that but all is it was they
 
07:04:13.280 --> 07:04:14.350 align:start position:0%
sorry for that but all is it was they
just

07:04:14.350 --> 07:04:14.360 align:start position:0%
just
 
07:04:16.628 --> 07:04:16.638 align:start position:0%
restated the prior amendment I think
 
07:04:20.628 --> 07:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
it's 033 h but with the change the
 
07:04:22.910 --> 07:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
singular change to
 
07:04:25.070 --> 07:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
quantify the uh
 
07:04:29.190 --> 07:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
foreign um definition in veterans
 
07:04:32.948 --> 07:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
definition um by by adding the the few
 
07:04:35.948 --> 07:04:35.958 align:start position:0%
words that I had suggested before do I
 
07:04:38.388 --> 07:04:38.398 align:start position:0%
have it here someplace I'm sure I do but
 
07:04:40.350 --> 07:04:40.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know where I think you probably
 
07:04:41.948 --> 07:04:41.958 align:start position:0%
remember that if that's what it's just
 
07:04:44.788 --> 07:04:44.798 align:start position:0%
that I looked at it and I thought
 
07:04:46.628 --> 07:04:46.638 align:start position:0%
there's no way I was going to be able to
 
07:04:50.708 --> 07:04:50.718 align:start position:0%
go line by line and see and I'd rather
 
07:04:53.510 --> 07:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
use your brain than fine I would have
 
07:04:56.830 --> 07:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
preferred that they did that in a short
 
07:05:00.830 --> 07:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph right um but I don't control
 
07:05:02.548 --> 07:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
that stuff and I don't know how to
 
07:05:04.990 --> 07:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
control it so I had to take what they
 
07:05:05.000 --> 07:05:06.430 align:start position:0%
control it so I had to take what they
offered

07:05:06.430 --> 07:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
offered
 
07:05:09.350 --> 07:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um but
 
07:05:11.910 --> 07:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
um but so those of the only change the
 
07:05:13.670 --> 07:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
changes that were made were the changes
 
07:05:15.070 --> 07:05:15.080 align:start position:0%
that we had talked about here in the
 
07:05:20.150 --> 07:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
committee yeah um that was off of um uh
 
07:05:23.110 --> 07:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
chairman Lynn's uh Amendment
 
07:05:27.750 --> 07:05:27.760 align:start position:0%

07:05:31.948 --> 07:05:31.958 align:start position:0%
