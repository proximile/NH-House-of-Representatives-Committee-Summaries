this is the the default budget uh
 
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
bill we had yesterday on official
 
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions on the bill yes
 
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i just want to
 
00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that uh testimony
 
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
we had from the new hampshire municipal
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
association and the municipal uh bureau
 
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
for the department of revenue
 
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.670 align:start position:0%
for the department of revenue
administration

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
um both said that this bill
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
creates multiple technical difficulties
 
00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
with current statute
 
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
i just don't think it's the responsible
 
00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
thing for this committee to recommend a
 
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
bill pass that
 
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
um if it goes into law creates
 
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
difficulties with the law it creates
 
00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies i i think that's a very
 
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
irresponsible thing to do
 
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.950 align:start position:0%
irresponsible thing to do
we

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
voted down the amendment but even the
 
00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.309 align:start position:0%
voted down the amendment but even the
amendment

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
only addresses one of those issues
 
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
i just don't think it's good practice
 
00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
for legislators to pass
 
00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:12.230 align:start position:0%
for legislators to pass
illegal

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh i just want to reiterate uh mr thank
 
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
you i just want to reiterate that the
 
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
is contrary to uh the amendment at line
 
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.830 align:start position:0%
is contrary to uh the amendment at line
nine

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
nine
 
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
is contrary to line 18 making a big
 
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
circle that towns are going to have to
 
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
struggle with whether they take
 
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
something out or
 
00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 align:start position:0%
use the contracts as previously approved
 
00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
whether you've made a reduction or not
 
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
um i i i think administrators and
 
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
and governing bodies are going to be
 
00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
scratching their heads over this one
 
00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
any further discussion yes represent yes
 
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 align:start position:0%

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
now now we need to disposition the bill
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
i move uh otp on house bill 1070
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
point of order is that is there a second
 
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
i'll second it mr chairman okay
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that a vote to
 
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
reconsider just goes back to the
 
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
previous motion so my understanding is
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
we have to vote on the itl
 
00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
if that fails then we bring otp motion
 
00:09:49.839 --> 00:10:01.269 align:start position:0%
if that fails then we bring otp motion
forward

00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative trip with you
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.190 align:start position:0%
withdraw your motion i would draw my

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and this is just a
 
00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
general observation that pertains to
 
00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
this bill nonetheless
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
which is that this committee is
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
generally in favor of passing enabling
 
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.990 align:start position:0%
generally in favor of passing enabling
legislation

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
and tends to shy away from statewide
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
bans or permissions or anything that
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
forces towns and cities
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
to give up
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
local control and i would just note that
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
this is not enabling legislation this is
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
a mandate
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh and it would
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
would affect all towns no matter what
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
their character no matter what their
 
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.790 align:start position:0%
their character no matter what their
process

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
and it just seems contrary to what we
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
typically do here
 
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%

1081 is the bill
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
it's relative to the dissolution of a
 
00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
yes yeah
 
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i'd like to move itl on
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
house bill 1081.
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
may i speak to my motion thank you um
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
i'm from merrimack and we have a village
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
district that provides municipal water
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
to most of our towns
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
and although a village district can be
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
established through a majority of the
 
00:17:25.439 --> 00:17:26.470 align:start position:0%
established through a majority of the
voters

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
voters
 
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
in the legislative body
 
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
i believe dissolution should remain at
 
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.350 align:start position:0%
i believe dissolution should remain at
two-thirds

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
two-thirds
 
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
the reason is and i'm speaking from
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
miramax experience is we have tens of
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars of infrastructure
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
and i think a decision to dissolve
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
that much capital
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
that's owned by the village district
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
should require at least the same
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
deliberation and threshold
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
that a bond does and a bond requires
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
two-thirds so um i just think this is a
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
decision that that requires
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
a much more support than what we see for
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
decisions that don't involve this level
 
00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.549 align:start position:0%
decisions that don't involve this level
of

00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%

um i'm opposed to the ought to pass for
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
the same reasons i was in support of the
 
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.350 align:start position:0%
the same reasons i was in support of the
itl

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
itl
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
many village districts in this state
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
have millions and millions of dollars of
 
00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.110 align:start position:0%
have millions and millions of dollars of
capital

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
capital
 
00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.230 align:start position:0%
capital
and

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.750 align:start position:0%
and
assets

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
assets
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
those should be treated as respectfully
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
as we treat bond issues which can even
 
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
be substantially lower amounts of money
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
i believe it's fiscally irresponsible
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
to treat dissolutions of village
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
districts with less attention and
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility than we do bond issues
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:14.480 align:start position:0%

own rules
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
to assume that all of the infrastructure
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
and everything else that has been
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
incorporated into that town by their
 
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.710 align:start position:0%
incorporated into that town by their
vote

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
could be undone by a majority vote i
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
think is completely irresponsible it
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
should require a two-thirds vote and i
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
will be voting against the otp thank you
 
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:02.710 align:start position:0%

we're talking about two different things
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
here we're talking about an amorphous
 
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.110 align:start position:0%
here we're talking about an amorphous
idea

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
constructed by people
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
the village district and then we are
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%

clear that we're not just dealing with
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
an amorphous idea we're dealing with
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
concrete tangible
 
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%

yes representative
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
i had sent over communication that i had
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
with the prime sponsor about this
 
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
um that karen representative ebel
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
who is working diligently on rules for
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
recycling and composting and ascending
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
stuff or is working through gel car in
 
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
that may
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
improve this bill and another bill that
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
we have coming up in another exec 1406 i
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
sent information over about that
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
which would
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
mean that it might be better to interim
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
study this bill rather than to pass it
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
now because if we pass it now we may
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
need to make considerable changes to it
 
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
after those rules have been adopted
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
i have no problem with letting the vote
 
00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:15.919 align:start position:0%
go through as it is
 
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
but i just wanted to say that that was
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
the conversation with the prime sponsor
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
that he would support interim study for
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh for this bill
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
to pump the brakes it's it's you know
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
you don't have to but you may want to
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
pump the brakes on this
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
rather than have to revisit something in
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
the future
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry that i don't have that answer
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
for you sorry
 
00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead please
 
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
discussion about this
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
i've been talking to the
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
chair that is uh
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
representative ebel about solid waste
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
management especially municipal waste
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
management and they are working on that
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
that commission is working diligently on
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
trying to address which is a big issue
 
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
uh in our state
 
00:28:47.919 --> 00:28:49.110 align:start position:0%
uh in our state
and

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative maggiore
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
alluded to what's happening so this all
 
00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
in a big discussion
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
to bring in something and then try to
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
amend it or change it would be a lot
 
00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.070 align:start position:0%
amend it or change it would be a lot
more

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.750 align:start position:0%
more
cumbersome

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
cumbersome
 
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
so interim study would give that
 
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
flush it out and bring a good bill back
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
wait a minute we're gonna go to
 
00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.149 align:start position:0%
wait a minute we're gonna go to
representative

00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
clay first
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
mr vice chair uh for letting me speak um
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
i i would have no problem if it got
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
changed to interim study um i do like
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
the idea of this and i have spoken to
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
our um
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
waste collection uh people
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
we're in the city of nashville we're
 
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
very unique in that we don't allow
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
dumping other than we have no contracts
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
or anything like that so it's basically
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
got to be residential dumping in our
 
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
particular thing but we are as everybody
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
else going to be losing space and one of
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
the things when i brought this up they
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
were quite interested because we're
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
considering doing our um construction
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
jumping changing it from
 
00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.510 align:start position:0%
jumping changing it from
90

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
90
 
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:04.470 align:start position:0%
90
a

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.350 align:start position:0%
a
ton

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
ton
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
to 300 a ton um just for that particular
 
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
reason so to be able to do something
 
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
like this i think would be a good idea
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
but i would like it to go through as
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
clean as possible so
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
if it's recommended if it's changed to
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
recommend to interim study that would be
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
a good idea
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
but i am for this this type of
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
legislation as well thank you
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
just so you know
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
i've asked the vice chair to contact the
 
00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.470 align:start position:0%
i've asked the vice chair to contact the
clerk

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.430 align:start position:0%
clerk
to

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
inquire about the
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
hierarchy emotions does the interim
 
00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:40.950 align:start position:0%
hierarchy emotions does the interim
study

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh is that a higher motion than we have
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
on the floor
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
yeah we have emotion
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
so uh if that comes back that it's a
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
higher motion then we'll we'll jump to
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
that motion
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
but uh i'm willing to have continued
 
00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:06.559 align:start position:0%
discussion if you want to representative
 
00:31:06.559 --> 00:31:08.549 align:start position:0%
discussion if you want to representative
gallagher

00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
gallagher
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
um well just
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
um all right so
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
i guess he's not here to hear it anymore
 
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
but for um
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
any of the rest of you were sharing rep
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
pia monty's
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
question about what exact sort of
 
00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
changes would be made in an interim
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
study committee one thing i had for my
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
notes was
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
the case that representative stavis
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
brought up of the trains
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
um bringing
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
debris to claremont to come
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
dump there so
 
00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
yeah i think
 
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
an interim study could
 
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
help us
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
find language to
 
00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
handle that case
 
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
specifically so that
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
it meets the approval of
 
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
people involved
 
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
so that that's one
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
reason i see interim study that's a good
 
00:32:03.919 --> 00:32:05.190 align:start position:0%
reason i see interim study that's a good
idea

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
okay represents davis
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
just to to
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
put a little more flesh on the bones of
 
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
the claremont issue which i raised in
 
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
a private freight company wanted to
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
establish an outpost in the city of
 
00:32:23.679 --> 00:32:24.870 align:start position:0%
establish an outpost in the city of
claremont

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
claremont
 
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
where they would deliver and process
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of pounds of
 
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
construction debris on a daily basis
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
with trains going in and out of the city
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
24 7.
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
the people of clermont
 
00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.389 align:start position:0%
the people of clermont
raised

00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
raised
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
of objections to this and it didn't pass
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
point that i was trying to make in the
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
committee hearing
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
was that we have no we the state have no
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
power over what the railroads do they
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
are under federal jurisdiction
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
but passing a law such as this
 
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
might give them a very convenient leg up
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
in the process
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
and why as a state would we do that why
 
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
would we seed that kind of control to
 
00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
the federal government when we don't
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
currently do it and we don't need to do
 
00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.630 align:start position:0%
currently do it and we don't need to do
it

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
and many municipalities already
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
receive and process and sell
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
construction debris thank you
 
00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:26.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcguire
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
next uh representative powell oh i'm
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
sorry i i didn't notice the right right
 
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative pimanti i'm
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
just looking through the emails i have
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
from representative ebel
 
00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a very short thing and it
 
00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
said this this came in last week
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
des is two to three weeks away from
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
sending new compost regulations to gel
 
00:33:47.279 --> 00:33:48.310 align:start position:0%
sending new compost regulations to gel
car

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
car
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
so a process is underway to simplify
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
composting for towns and other entities
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
this is what we might want to
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
incorporate into
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
both 1122 and 1406 should you consider
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
so again not not as specific as we might
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
want but knowing something is coming
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative power
 
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:12.079 align:start position:0%
i just had an inquiry my notes say that
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
it was suggested that representatives
 
00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:15.750 align:start position:0%
it was suggested that representatives
egan

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
egan
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
stavis and manjapudi
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
work with
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
bring forward an amendment
 
00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.310 align:start position:0%
bring forward an amendment
did

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
did that happen or not
 
00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.079 align:start position:0%
is there amendment on the floor
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
no amendment yeah um in response to that
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
we did get a email i did get an email
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
from the sponsor
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
but again because of representative
 
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
ebel's email who's working on a
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
statewide commission
 
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
you know that was
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
we didn't move further on my
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
participation would have been handling
 
00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.190 align:start position:0%
participation would have been handling
the

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
municipal solid waste
 
00:35:01.829 --> 00:35:01.839 align:start position:0%
aggregation of all of the waste and
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
that was one piece of the puzzle
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
but because we got this email the prime
 
00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.950 align:start position:0%
but because we got this email the prime
sponsor

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
and uh the municipal association when we
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
had that email conversation that was uh
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
deemed uh
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
best to do an interim study and push
 
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
this off rather than pushing something
 
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
through uh for the sake of pushing it
 
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.349 align:start position:0%
through uh for the sake of pushing it
through

00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:35:25.359 --> 00:35:27.030 align:start position:0%
through
representatives

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chair and just for
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
further clarification for those on the
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
committee who may not have been here in
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
the last session or who are subbing
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
this committee has taken on the issue of
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
solid waste
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
and we have taken a very careful look at
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
it and we consulted with public works
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
whose chair was karen ebel at the time
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
who then created this task force
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
and i believe that the amendment that
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
representative power may be referring to
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
was a conversation
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
with representative ebel to determine
 
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
where the task force stood in its
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
disposition on issues of solid waste
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
relating to the state and not an
 
00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.150 align:start position:0%
relating to the state and not an
amendment

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
that may just have been a difference in
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
understanding of the communication
 
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
however this committee has worked
 
00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.550 align:start position:0%
however this committee has worked
diligently

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
diligently
 
00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.150 align:start position:0%
diligently
with

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
the public works committee on the issue
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
of solid waste and the waste stream in
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
general in the state
 
00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.230 align:start position:0%
general in the state
and

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
comprehensive legislation to address
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
that growing problem
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
is in the works and
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
small pieces of legislation like this
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
one and uh could
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
result in
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
kind of contra indications to what that
 
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
commission ultimately
 
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
recommends and therefore this will have
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
to be repealed or amended or and it
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
would be cumbersome
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
so it would be prudent in my view to
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
wait and see what that commission
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
recommends and what des recommends as a
 
00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.630 align:start position:0%
recommends and what des recommends as a
result

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
result
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
take another bite at these bills
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh we we have had
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
some more discussion but i want to ask a
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
question representative davis is it your
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
that if this bill were to pass that
 
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.430 align:start position:0%
that if this bill were to pass that
claremont

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
claremont
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
would no longer have control
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
over this that that even if they didn't
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
want this debris in their town they're
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
going to get in any way because of the
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
railroad connection
 
00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair it's a really good
 
00:37:37.359 --> 00:37:38.470 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair it's a really good
question

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.270 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.430 align:start position:0%
um
no

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
i think what i was trying to express was
 
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
that railroads have tremendous federal
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
power and protection and every piece of
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
legislation that we pass at the state
 
00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.470 align:start position:0%
legislation that we pass at the state
level

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.349 align:start position:0%
level
that

00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
eases the way of a railroad that goes
 
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
through a community that may not want
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste going through its
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
community just makes it easier
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
for them to do that
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
and therefore i think it's not prudent
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
of us to give them a leg up
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
they already have a leg up why give them
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
another one
 
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative tripp
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh
 
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
in my notes i i uh
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
i see a
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
an uh an item that says that this is an
 
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
enabling bill
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
which means that uh not this is not
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
something that's a state mandate that uh
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
towns and cities and
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
whatever uh
 
00:38:39.599 --> 00:38:41.030 align:start position:0%
whatever uh
allow

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh dumping of construction and
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
demolition waste at their uh transfer
 
00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.430 align:start position:0%
demolition waste at their uh transfer
stations

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
stations
 
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.790 align:start position:0%
stations
um

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
i tend to agree with you that uh
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
if if a town
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
isn't planning on doing this then some
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
guidance would be helpful as to setting
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
the rules of how the uh the
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
dumping of uh construction and
 
00:39:03.599 --> 00:39:04.790 align:start position:0%
dumping of uh construction and
demolition

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
demolition
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh debris
 
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh is going to work but if the town is
 
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
interested in doing something i i'm
 
00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
assuming that
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
they have looked into
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
what types of
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition debris is
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
going to be accepted and how it's going
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
to be processed
 
00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:25.910 align:start position:0%
to be processed
and

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:26.790 align:start position:0%
and
and

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
what uh benefits would result from this
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
so i am in favor of this bill and i will
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
vote be voting yes
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thanks everyone
 
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
for your comments i'm gonna bring us
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
back to the to the trash yard where this
 
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
debris is going and
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
talk for a moment about the fact that
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
in my town dover there are some
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
materials we don't take
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
but in the town next to us which is
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
rochester new hampshire they take
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
lots of stuff and both of these entities
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
our transfer stations in rochester's
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
would love to be able to resell any
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
construction debris that was resellable
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
they need help and guidance as to what
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
why make each town
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
reinvent the wheel
 
00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
each time they may want to do it
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
when we can take a step back
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
and give some guidance to our local
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
communities regarding
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
what is left over woodwork what is
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
leftover this and that work what is not
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
worth anything and needs to be
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
thrown away because the bill talks about
 
00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:37.839 align:start position:0%
collecting and reselling and i think
 
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
that's what lights everybody's eyes up
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
because we all like
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
more profit for our communities
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
and more ecologically friendly practices
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
so i think that an interim study
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
resolution to this bill would be great
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
because there are mines working together
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
to put out a better solution
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
that everyone could choose from still an
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
enabling possibility but not everybody
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
having to reinvent that solution going
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
forward thank you
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:13.589 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
to

00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
elaborate a little more on my colleague
 
00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
just know who spoke to
 
00:41:19.599 --> 00:41:20.550 align:start position:0%
just know who spoke to
say

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
this is the step in the right direction
 
00:41:23.119 --> 00:41:24.230 align:start position:0%
this is the step in the right direction
but

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
there's a major effort
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
statewide a commission that was
 
00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.270 align:start position:0%
statewide a commission that was
established

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
established
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
to study exclusively the municipal
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
solid waste and disposal
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
and all the issues surrounding waste
 
00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.190 align:start position:0%
and all the issues surrounding waste
management

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
management
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
is happening
 
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
and why
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
not wait of you know just a little bit
 
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
in a few weeks
 
00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.750 align:start position:0%
in a few weeks
some

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
statewide guidelines is going to come up
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
if they're already putting all the time
 
00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
and effort
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
and just wait isn't this what we do as a
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
legislators to
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
understand the study and understand the
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
issue and make the right decision which
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
is enabling for the local community so i
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
think with that in mind
 
00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying you know we have
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
going in the right direction but put it
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
as an interim study and incorporate what
 
00:42:25.599 --> 00:42:26.950 align:start position:0%
as an interim study and incorporate what
happens

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
in a few weeks
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman i have a a
 
00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.589 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman i have a a
question

00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:42:37.599 --> 00:42:38.470 align:start position:0%
question
uh

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
in my town we don't allow
 
00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
any uh
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh construction material in our uh uh of
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
our site but my question is and i don't
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
know if anybody can answer it is
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
can't the towns do this now what do we
 
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
need a bill to allow
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
something that the town can do as a
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
local option anyway again
 
00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:05.839 align:start position:0%
so i i'm sort of at a loss
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
in the in the
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.270 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
wording of the bill this is this says
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
that the town may do this
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
and that implies that they may not do it
 
00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.270 align:start position:0%
and that implies that they may not do it
if

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
if they
 
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
this is if the bill passes so if they
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
choose hey what we don't want anything
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
this construction debris in our town
 
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
they could say no
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
it feels like enabling but yeah i
 
00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
understand that mr chairman but my
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
question is can't the local communities
 
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
do this
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
now without this bill
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
and i ask if there's any member of the
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
committee that might have that
 
00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.990 align:start position:0%
committee that might have that
information

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie i think it's a
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
great question
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
and um specifically my understanding is
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
that a town cannot resell construction
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
debris at this point
 
00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:00.630 align:start position:0%
debris at this point
the

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
site the landfill in rochester new
 
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire is owned by
 
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
waste management company they're a
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
private company they provide a service
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
to the public
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
to my town as well they collect our
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
rubbish these days we have a contract
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
with them
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
they can resell construction debris
 
00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:20.470 align:start position:0%
they can resell construction debris
but

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
but a town
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
municipality on its own cannot as far as
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
i understand the only reason waste
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
management can do it is because they're
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
a private company they still have issues
 
00:44:30.079 --> 00:44:31.270 align:start position:0%
a private company they still have issues
with

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
sorting that debris
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
what goes where what can they do and
 
00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
it becomes kind of trashy
 
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that information
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chairman
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh yes i in in
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
sandown we have a
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
tank we have a
 
00:44:51.359 --> 00:44:52.150 align:start position:0%
tank we have a
site

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
site
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
okay sorry about that
 
00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
um in sandown we have a a tank that we
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
put construction debris in
 
00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:01.589 align:start position:0%
put construction debris in
um

00:45:01.589 --> 00:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
and then we have also another area where
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
we put like brick or
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
rock or things of that nature
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
and they use that pretty much as a
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
landfill type of thing
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering did
 
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know what they did they burn
 
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
this uh say the wood from the
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
construction debris or i know that the
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
pressure treated wood goes in a separate
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
area that they can't burn
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
but um i'm just wondering
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
what value is of this debris we're
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative i think that's the
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
goal of the interim study representative
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
piemonte to find out
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
what the value is and how to do it i'm
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
sure there are other
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
states in the united states of america
 
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
that do this and we could learn from
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
their experience
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
okay just have a follow-up follow-up uh
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
yes the um
 
00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
i know when the hauler hauls it away and
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
it goes by a certain dollar amount per
 
00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:58.710 align:start position:0%
it goes by a certain dollar amount per
ton

00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
ton
 
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
um i i would like to see on that if it
 
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
goes to an interim study to uh
 
00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
take those things into consideration
 
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
um i mean
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
it might be cheaper just to leave it the
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:18.470 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
oh now representative gilman
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair one of the other
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
things that came up during the testimony
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
was um
 
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
whether or not we might want to make a
 
00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.710 align:start position:0%
whether or not we might want to make a
regional

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
regional
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
construction debris area
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
which is something that would be
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
considered an interim study
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
because it certainly hasn't been talked
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
about here
 
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh any further discussion
 
00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.309 align:start position:0%
thank you uh any further discussion
yes

00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:46:46.319 --> 00:46:47.829 align:start position:0%
yes
representative

00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
in in my town what we do is we we have
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
containers for up for uh construction
 
00:46:55.349 --> 00:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
material and we take it in from three
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
other towns
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
we get paid
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
coming in the door but we pay it going
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
out the door
 
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
is that is that a profitable
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
situation yes
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
we'd like to get paid going out the door
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
too representative clay
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman i think one of
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
the if i remember correctly in the
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
conversation is that
 
00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:18.309 align:start position:0%
conversation is that
when

00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
people um
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
do their the dumping of this material
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
they do have to pay x amount per ton as
 
00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
as was spoken here
 
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
and whether it's sorted or not it does
 
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
go up but this gives the opportunity of
 
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.030 align:start position:0%
go up but this gives the opportunity of
the

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
people who are doing the demolition
 
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
to not have to pay that tipping fee or
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
whatever cost you want to call that
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
because it could be resold
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
um and it was kind of a win-win
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
situation or they would pay less
 
00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
on a tipping fee so i think it was a win
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
that it didn't just become
 
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
it could get reused by habitat and i
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
think some of the materials may have
 
00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
been um construction materials of
 
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
of wood but also of like cabinetry doors
 
00:48:04.829 --> 00:48:04.839 align:start position:0%
i think were mentioned and so on so i
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
think and because it's enabling i i
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
think that's what um
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
one of the benefits of it were that we
 
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
could work with people in construction
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
it didn't fill up our landfills it kind
 
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
of went back out there as i said like
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
something for a habitat for humanity or
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
someone who was looking for doors or of
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
some that nature if i remember correctly
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm going to end the dialogue
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
on this particular bill right now and
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%

00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
is is that something we can do or
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
i wasn't there something i can do wasn't
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
there emotion on it
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%

their fingers into other

uh entities within the uh

uh
 
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
organization and that they should be uh
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh limited
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
there are other
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
people that believe that uh this is uh
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
a good idea
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
i mean a bad idea and that uh you know
 
00:51:42.079 --> 00:51:43.510 align:start position:0%
i mean a bad idea and that uh you know
uh

00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
appointed boards
 
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
uh appointing a uh ex official member
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
they should have the same rights as uh

they should have the same rights as uh
the

00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:55.839 align:start position:0%
the appointed members so uh
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
i i believe that
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
there's such a uh
 
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
a broad range of
 
00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.270 align:start position:0%
a broad range of
uh

00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
how this is handled within a state right
 
00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:06.069 align:start position:0%
how this is handled within a state right
now

00:52:06.069 --> 00:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
now

this time but there is an amendment to

00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
uh just as a heads up thinking about

00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.950 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
would you like me to speak to this
 
00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.150 align:start position:0%
would you like me to speak to this
amendment

00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
yes uh
 
00:53:26.309 --> 00:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
because we took the motion
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
yeah we have a motion on the floor right
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
to uh vote for interim study um
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
it's slightly unusual that
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
that we have a discussion on it but
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
in order to be
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
as open and
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
accommodating as possible i'll
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i have a follow-up so
 
00:53:59.599 --> 00:54:00.390 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i have a follow-up so
just

00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
for me to understand as a freshman
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that we have a motion on
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
the floor for i interim study that does
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
not pertain to an amendment therefore
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's not appropriate for me to speak to
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment because we're not voting
 
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
on that so if that's the case i
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
would not like to speak to the amendment
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
because it's inappropriate
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
any further inputs on
 
00:54:29.109 --> 00:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
all right let's dispose of the amendment
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
and if it if
 
00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
if the bill is still alive then we'll
 
00:54:43.349 --> 00:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
so the motion on the floor is the
 
00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:47.839 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%

is there any further discussion on
 
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%

is it's it's essentially a
 
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
a recall bill
 
00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:16.230 align:start position:0%
a recall bill
and

00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%

00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
people serve
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
their term
 
00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
and the voters determine
 
00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
whether they're suitable for their
 
00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:30.069 align:start position:0%
whether they're suitable for their
office

00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
and for another term and i'm going to
 
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
support my itl
 
00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
okay representative gallagher
 
00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:39.349 align:start position:0%
okay representative gallagher
so

00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
um i'd just like to say that
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
um so yeah i agree with the motion to
 
00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:45.349 align:start position:0%
um so yeah i agree with the motion to
itl

00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
itl
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
and i want to clarify that in
 
00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
supporting itl in this it's not about
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
the general idea of having ethics
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
standards or anything that's about
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
this build just being
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem well thought out enough
 
01:00:01.839 --> 01:00:02.950 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem well thought out enough
the

01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh sponsor seemed unable to answer a lot
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
of the questions
 
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
we had for
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
him about it and
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
it seems like it really could have used
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
a lot more work so
 
01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.349 align:start position:0%
a lot more work so
um

01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think that is why it makes
 
01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
sense to go to idea on this
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gallagher uh
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
um i also support the itl motion
 
01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:34.630 align:start position:0%
um i also support the itl motion
uh

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.589 align:start position:0%
uh
for

01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
all of the reasons representative tripp
 
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
enumerated but in addition i support the
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
itl motion because of the bill stating
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
that the person who found quote unquote
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
guilty of such an ethics violation will
 
01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.309 align:start position:0%
guilty of such an ethics violation will
be

01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
charged with a misdemeanor
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
which is a heavy thing
 
01:01:00.549 --> 01:01:00.559 align:start position:0%
in this state and really needs to be
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
thought out by the criminal justice
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
committee and there needs to be a a
 
01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.549 align:start position:0%
committee and there needs to be a a
process

01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
due process given to anyone who's
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
charged of a crime in this state and
 
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
that bill that bill does not do this
 
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
if i could add to that i think that
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
the issue here is that if someone is
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
charged with a misdemeanor on a public
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
board in most towns
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
i can't say oh most towns that
 
01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
that means they must leave the board
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
that they're appointed to
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
so the punishment is
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
more severe than we might be thinking
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative maturity do you have a
 
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.190 align:start position:0%
representative maturity do you have a
comment

01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i support the itl
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
motion and go back to the uh to the
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
document that northampton adopted and
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
encourage anybody to just um google
 
01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
ethics northampton and you'll see the
 
01:01:53.589 --> 01:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
case that we had there
 
01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
that was the first test of our ethics
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
ordinance that was passed by the voters
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
of northampton the legal fees cost more
 
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
than 20 thousand dollars during the
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
first test
 
01:02:07.109 --> 01:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
of that document which has already been
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
vetted by council
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
and under that first test and under all
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
those legal fees again to reiterate what
 
01:02:15.029 --> 01:02:15.039 align:start position:0%
i said in the public hearing it was
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
proven that that document was
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
poorly written and could not be executed
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
could not be adjudicated i love the
 
01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.190 align:start position:0%
could not be adjudicated i love the
intent

01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
intent
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
but the execution is extraordinarily
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
difficult and will be tested in court so
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair in my notes i support
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
the itl for a couple of reasons one is
 
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
uh to add to all the previous speakers i
 
01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
also asked the question of the prime
 
01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
sponsor at that time
 
01:02:45.119 --> 01:02:46.150 align:start position:0%
sponsor at that time
so

01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
was the intention of this bill to
 
01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.150 align:start position:0%
was the intention of this bill to
enhance

01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
enhance
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
individual moral and ethical value
 
01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
system by enforcing collective effort or
 
01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.029 align:start position:0%
system by enforcing collective effort or
legislating

01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
legislating
 
01:03:01.829 --> 01:03:01.839 align:start position:0%
the individual moral and ethical values
 
01:03:01.839 --> 01:03:03.190 align:start position:0%
the individual moral and ethical values
and

01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
he did indicate yes and that would be a
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
tall order to
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
be able to enforce
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
in the enhanced individual moral and
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
ethical values through legislatively
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
collective effort
 
01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:21.349 align:start position:0%
collective effort
and

01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
you know holding elected official
 
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
to a higher standard yes i agree we need
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
to have that but not with the
 
01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
criminal charge
 
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
or the criminal hammer hanging over the
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
head to say if you violate the ethical
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
or moral value system then you are
 
01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
penalized criminalized for that so for
 
01:03:49.359 --> 01:03:50.309 align:start position:0%
penalized criminalized for that so for
that

01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
i think this is
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
not a bill that we can
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
i would support itl
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
i will support itl at this time thank
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
you any other discussion
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
seeing then let me let me mention that
 
01:04:08.549 --> 01:04:08.559 align:start position:0%
my experience with this in my community
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
is that we do have in londonderry we do
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
have an ethics
 
01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.870 align:start position:0%
have an ethics
ordinance

01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
i'm not a big fan of it i don't think
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
you can legislate
 
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
good behavior or moral conduct
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
and it is my
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
thought that ethics rules ought to be
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
much more aspirational
 
01:04:30.079 --> 01:04:31.750 align:start position:0%
much more aspirational
than

01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.910 align:start position:0%
than
mandates

01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
but we we have it and
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
14 years
 
01:04:45.839 --> 01:04:46.789 align:start position:0%
14 years
and

01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
so far nobody
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
has been brought up on an ethics
 
01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.589 align:start position:0%
has been brought up on an ethics
violation

01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
violation
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
in 14 years
 
01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's a
 
01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
testament to the
 
01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
good behavior of the community i think
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
it's a testament to the fact that
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to enforce these types of
 
01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.950 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to enforce these types of
vague

01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
vague
 
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
issues like i said i it's my thought
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
that this should be much more
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
aspirational than than
 
01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:14.870 align:start position:0%
aspirational than than
directed

01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
directed

mr chair yeah this has a fn can you do

mr chair yeah this has a fn can you do

01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
that's a good question uh i may not be
 
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
able to i'll but it is local
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say
 
01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
so but i'll double check if i can't put
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
it on the calendar it'll be in the
 
01:06:55.589 --> 01:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
representative did you have some wisdom
 
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
next we have a bill about composting
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
hp 1172 fn which is
 
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
requires a composting and waste
 
01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
recycling to be made available to
 
01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
representative lasallis do you have a
 
01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.150 align:start position:0%
representative lasallis do you have a
motion

01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman although the intent of
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is very
 
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.230 align:start position:0%
this bill is very
admirable

01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
admirable
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
during our discussion of the bill it
 
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
seemed to me as if
 
01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.630 align:start position:0%
seemed to me as if
the

01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:45.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
implementation of this
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
would be very cumbersome at this point
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
down the road
 
01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:56.799 align:start position:0%
we may be able to do that but
 
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
i will move itl
 
01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
mr chair i have a question for the chair
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor has his hand up and he
 
01:08:13.829 --> 01:08:13.839 align:start position:0%
might have an amendment so wouldn't that
 
01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
be something that we would consider
 
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
we have do we have an amendment on
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor is holding it up and
 
01:08:29.759 --> 01:08:30.709 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor is holding it up and
having

01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative lasalles
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
would you withdraw your motion i will mr
 
01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:44.149 align:start position:0%
would you withdraw your motion i will mr
chairman

01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
so do we have any further discussion
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative gallagher would like
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
to speak to this
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
so yes i have an amendment to
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
introduce to
 
01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:07.759 align:start position:0%
this bill based on
 
01:09:07.759 --> 01:09:08.789 align:start position:0%
this bill based on
our

01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
discussion in the hearing about it
 
01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:13.910 align:start position:0%
discussion in the hearing about it
so

01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.430 align:start position:0%
so
it

01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
makes reference to
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
it adds a reference to rsa 149
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
m colon 2 which was something that
 
01:09:27.269 --> 01:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
representative gilman
 
01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:33.430 align:start position:0%
representative gilman
suggested

01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
it gives a definition for public housing
 
01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
because that was
 
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
a question about what exactly this law
 
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
would apply to
 
01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:44.799 align:start position:0%
the definition here we're using it
 
01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
administered by a public housing
 
01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:50.070 align:start position:0%
administered by a public housing
authority

01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
that adds the word
 
01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:55.590 align:start position:0%
that adds the word
onsite

01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
onsite
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
to clarify
 
01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:00.470 align:start position:0%
to clarify
where

01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
where exactly this compost and recycling
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
has to be
 
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
and it changes
 
01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
facility to receptacles or bins since
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
there were some questions about what
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
exactly was meant by
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
a facility
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
i i hope that helps
 
01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:21.270 align:start position:0%
i i hope that helps
clarify

01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
some of the questions people had about
 
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.030 align:start position:0%
some of the questions people had about
the

01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%

of

01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%

yes

01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
we don't have copies of the amendment is
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
it coming or
 
01:11:00.149 --> 01:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
oh is it

oh this is it i'm sorry yeah um i i
 
01:11:05.189 --> 01:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
believe i handed it around um there's
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
more over there on the table if
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a motion and a second on
 
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.669 align:start position:0%
yes representative
uh

01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
may i speak to the the amendment yes
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
you've made
 
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that uh
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
was uh brought up in the uh
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
of the uh the bill was that uh
 
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
well there
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
it does talk to
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh the collection
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
of uh the compost scene material
 
01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't talk to what's going
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
to be done with it once it's collected
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
and uh i see that
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh answer that question either
 
01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's a laudable uh thing to do
 
01:12:01.679 --> 01:12:02.630 align:start position:0%
it's it's a laudable uh thing to do
because

01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:12:04.709 --> 01:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
composting would would uh
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
reduce the uh the loading of the uh
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
trash in the uh
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
landfills but uh like i said this this
 
01:12:16.630 --> 01:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
still doesn't answer the question of
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
what do you do with the the compost once
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
you've collected it thank you
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
thank you is there further discussion is
 
01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i share representative tripp's
 
01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
concern um but i'm going to support the
 
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
amendment and hope that it serves to
 
01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.030 align:start position:0%
amendment and hope that it serves to
um

01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
provide information for perhaps interim
 
01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:38.149 align:start position:0%
provide information for perhaps interim
study

01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
yes of course i'm a sub in the committee
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
it wasn't part of the hearings when it
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
took place but my question in my mind is
 
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
is there room everywhere to put another
 
01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:51.910 align:start position:0%
is there room everywhere to put another
bin

01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
bin
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
besides recycle and solid waste is is is
 
01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
there a constraint at least some public
 
01:12:58.630 --> 01:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
housing which would make it very
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
i'm going to echo what i hear from my
 
01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
friend representative wrong
 
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
that um i can support the amendment
 
01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
because i think it improves the bill
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
but i i might want to uh hope that this
 
01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
bill will go to interim study under the
 
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
same conditions that 11 22
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
and later 1406
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
i'm going to hope for the same thing
 
01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
because we might get information from
 
01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.590 align:start position:0%
because we might get information from
des

01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
des
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
that that improves the situation uh for
 
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
for these folks and and answer some of
 
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
the questions that we are raising here
 
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you yes you have a question
 
01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:42.229 align:start position:0%
thank you yes you have a question
representative

01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:13:42.239 --> 01:13:43.430 align:start position:0%
representative
yes

01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
in public housing do you have to get
 
01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:47.270 align:start position:0%
in public housing do you have to get
permission

01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
permission
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
from it oh sorry
 
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh in public housing do you have to get
 
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
permission from the housing authority to
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
um well the housing authority
 
01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
the housing authority runs the building
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
like if someone were
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
just to put out one
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
of their own recycling bins or
 
01:14:16.719 --> 01:14:18.310 align:start position:0%
of their own recycling bins or
um

01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.669 align:start position:0%
um
or

01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
compost bins there's no real guarantee
 
01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
as to what would happen to it um
 
01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:28.470 align:start position:0%
as to what would happen to it um
like

01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
you know they they they have
 
01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
they the public housing authority owns
 
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
the property and have the right to do
 
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:40.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:48.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
it didn't quite answer my question
 
01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:51.910 align:start position:0%
it didn't quite answer my question
um

01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
were they notified in
 
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
agreement with this or
 
01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:57.990 align:start position:0%
agreement with this or
um

01:14:57.990 --> 01:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
how how does that work i mean i
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
understand if somebody puts out a bin
 
01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
and they don't
 
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
they have to approve it i would assume
 
01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:07.750 align:start position:0%
they have to approve it i would assume
um

01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
so yes i did try um reaching out to
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
my local housing authority
 
01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.510 align:start position:0%
my local housing authority
about

01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:28.070 align:start position:0%
this bill
and

01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't really able to get a clear answer
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's why i think
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
if we do legislation we'll get certainty
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
quicker rather than if we just wait
 
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
around for the public housing authority
 
01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:54.630 align:start position:0%
around for the public housing authority
to

01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
make up its mind i didn't hear that last
 
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
statement i'm sorry all right follow up
 
01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
could you repeat that last sentence you
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
said i didn't i couldn't hear it with
 
01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:04.870 align:start position:0%
said i didn't i couldn't hear it with
the

01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
face um
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
i i think that
 
01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.990 align:start position:0%
i i think that
if

01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
we pass this bill legislatively that
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
will be a quicker way to get
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
certainty about
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
this situation than
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
01:16:26.719 --> 01:16:28.470 align:start position:0%
it would be
if

01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
i were just to continue to wait around
 
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
to hear back and answer from
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
the public housing authority on my own
 
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:42.950 align:start position:0%
yes representative
um

01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any instance in which
 
01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
legislation that we are considering must
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
be approved by unauthority that it
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
might be subject to
 
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
i i don't
 
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
understand how that question is germane
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
to either via the amendment or the bill
 
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
but having said that
 
01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:06.870 align:start position:0%
but having said that
um

01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
should def
 
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
issue new recommendations which they
 
01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
surely will be doing along with the
 
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
solid waste commission
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
it would be um
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
a violation of the rights of residents
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
of public housing where the
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
hud not to provide the same benefits
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
that other citizens enjoy
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
but but having said that i'm not aware
 
01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
that we ask permission or approval from
 
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
any organization that our legislation
 
01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:39.750 align:start position:0%
any organization that our legislation
addresses

01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
when we are considering such legislation
 
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:45.590 align:start position:0%
further discussion
yes

01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
representative gilman
 
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh one thing i'd like
 
01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
to point out on the amendment which i
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
like better than the original bill
 
01:17:53.679 --> 01:17:54.709 align:start position:0%
like better than the original bill
um

01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
is that it doesn't uh tell the public
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
housing what they have to do
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
it just
 
01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:02.470 align:start position:0%
it just
and

01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.590 align:start position:0%
and
it

01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
tells the towns to ensure public housing
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
has access to the appropriate
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
site for composting et cetera
 
01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
representative and representative
 
01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
i believe that you have to talk to the
 
01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
housing authority
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
and they probably will have to get
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
permission from hud
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
and i think it you'd wait for an answer
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
for a long time
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
i i really don't you know i've worked
 
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
for the housing authority
 
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
and they don't allow any of this stuff
 
01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:36.790 align:start position:0%
and they don't allow any of this stuff
nothing

01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
if your cars broke down they're gonna
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
have a towed out you know they're real
 
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative majipuni
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
just looking at the opportunity equal
 
01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:52.870 align:start position:0%
just looking at the opportunity equal
opportunity

01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
just because
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
citizens are living in a housing
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
authority and want to do the right thing
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
such a hard
 
01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:07.110 align:start position:0%
such a hard
climb

01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
climb
 
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
to have this opportunity to compost or
 
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
do the right thing
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
even though they are you know this
 
01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:17.030 align:start position:0%
even though they are you know this
if

01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's not available it to me it is a
 
01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:21.990 align:start position:0%
it's not available it to me it is a
discriminatory

01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
discriminatory
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
practice so
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
i am
 
01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
one rule for one
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
so this is public housing and to bring
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
in not every community has composting
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
not everybody has a citywide composting
 
01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
so this is a good start
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
and so i mean i know nashua has a
 
01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:47.350 align:start position:0%
and so i mean i know nashua has a
private

01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
private
 
01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:48.470 align:start position:0%
private
curbside

01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
curbside
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
paid composting and if that is working
 
01:19:54.149 --> 01:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
well it might look at
 
01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
adopting citywide if it's not going to
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
cost the city more
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
right so we have to look at the good
 
01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
practices and see how that could be so
 
01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
just that my comment thank you
 
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie
 
01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair it seems to me that
 
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
the comments that have been made so far
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
has shown that the elephant in the room
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
really is the same old shell
 
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
and that since the amendment has still
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
has shell in it although as indicated
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
the intent is there i cannot
 
01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.229 align:start position:0%
the intent is there i cannot
support

01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
either the amendment or the bill
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that it's
 
01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:34.070 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that it's
it

01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
is not may it doesn't have any
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
flexibility it's a shell so
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
i just think that that's the elephant in
 
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
the room and for whatever reason i
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh other reasons i cannot
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
vote for the amendment representative
 
01:20:52.629 --> 01:20:52.639 align:start position:0%
ayer you have an additional comment
 
01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
yes i uh i worry about animals they're
 
01:20:58.790 --> 01:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
putting food out and all kinds of things
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
like that in the compost pile
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
i would worry
 
01:21:04.870 --> 01:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
about rats and
 
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair while i appreciate
 
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill it appears to me
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
that this is an unfunded mandate and
 
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
that that concerns me
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:21:23.679 --> 01:21:26.229 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
representative

01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the elephant is
 
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
all right i have a
 
01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:40.070 align:start position:0%
all right i have a
comment

01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
one thing representative gallery it
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear that you have a
 
01:21:44.159 --> 01:21:45.110 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear that you have a
well

01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
you don't have any co-sponsors at least
 
01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
published on this
 
01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm a little concerned about
 
01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh what the rest of the community that
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
we deal with feels about this it's like
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
a single point
 
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.910 align:start position:0%
a single point
solution

01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
solution
 
01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.430 align:start position:0%
solution
and

01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
when you when we look at composting
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
i do composting it and i know that
 
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
a cop my composting pile takes about the
 
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
entire summer
 
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
for it to
 
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
turn over and
 
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
turn into a fertilizer and so forth
 
01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:24.639 align:start position:0%
so and we've been mixing in discussions
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
about weekly pickups
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
and or our periodic pickups of the of
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
the composting
 
01:22:32.159 --> 01:22:33.669 align:start position:0%
the composting
so

01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking that uh
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
that we might need some time with uh
 
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
with the state
 
01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh and their engineers to talk about
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
what what is the right frequency uh
 
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
what are the right locations
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
we heard a representative talk about
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
drawing animals in
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
and and i'm not talking about animals of
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
the good type
 
01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.270 align:start position:0%
the good type
so

01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
how we deal with that is it do you need
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
to put poison out to accommodate them
 
01:23:07.199 --> 01:23:08.550 align:start position:0%
to put poison out to accommodate them
and

01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
what are the implications to local
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
children with that so
 
01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:14.719 align:start position:0%
what i'm reflecting back to you is that
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
it seems to me be a lot of unanswered
 
01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
questions with this
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
so that's my airport yes representative
 
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'm a tad concerned
 
01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:28.639 align:start position:0%
that you specifically spoke directly to
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the bill
 
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
and questioned his
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
ability to enter a bill with or without
 
01:23:36.159 --> 01:23:37.510 align:start position:0%
ability to enter a bill with or without
co-sponsors

01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors
 
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
what does it matter if he has any
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors well uh that's a good point
 
01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.639 align:start position:0%
my thought is that uh when when you have
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of co-sponsors on a on a
 
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that is
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
its virgin if you will to the
 
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:23:58.149 --> 01:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh legislature it helps to know
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
that this isn't just one of four hundred
 
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
this is one of several that have that
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
have thought about this
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know how
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
kawasa county feels about it i don't
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
know about belknap county
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
about the people over in keene do they
 
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
want to do this
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
i i just i'm looking for more input
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
i don't mean to be criticizing
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
the representative i think
 
01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
someone already said that
 
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
this is a great idea
 
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
i've my thought is it's just not well
 
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
thought through
 
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
and i think it would help
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
if you had
 
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
seven or eight people sitting around the
 
01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:41.910 align:start position:0%
seven or eight people sitting around the
table

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
table
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
either all reps or representatives of
 
01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
the state to discuss this and put issues
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
on the table and work through them and
 
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
then you'd you you'd get you'd come back
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
and you'd have some lessons to learn
 
01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
well we talked to this and that and
 
01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
here's what they said and
 
01:24:59.830 --> 01:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
and we get to stop doing this first and
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
you know that those are very valuable
 
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
discussions if you can capture them yes
 
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
for everything that's davis
 
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and what you
 
01:25:11.110 --> 01:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
described just perfectly is interim
 
01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:12.629 align:start position:0%
described just perfectly is interim
study

01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:12.639 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
and i wonder why this bill can't be
 
01:25:18.149 --> 01:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
afforded the same dignity
 
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
as the other bills of the same ilk
 
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
and go to interim study it it seems to
 
01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:25.270 align:start position:0%
and go to interim study it it seems to
me

01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:25:26.709 --> 01:25:26.719 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
ability to compost one's food should not
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
be dependent upon where ones lives are
 
01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
one circumstances in life
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
that if if the date determines the
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines for such composting
 
01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
then they should be
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
carried out statewide
 
01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
and and why this bill can't go to
 
01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
interim study with the other bills of
 
01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
the same sort would be a mystery to me
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
because you just described it eloquently
 
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:25:59.430 --> 01:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you again mr chair and thank you

representatives davis for pointing that
 
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
out i i would just add that
 
01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
we are currently in the mode of adopting
 
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment so should we want to get
 
01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:08.870 align:start position:0%
the amendment so should we want to get
to

01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
interim study we need to act on this
 
01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:12.390 align:start position:0%
interim study we need to act on this
first

01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
and then go forward apologies no apology
 
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you yes representative
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
um this is not about the bill but i'm
 
01:26:22.470 --> 01:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
asking about your comment just to ask
 
01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
the question of the chair
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
you alluded to
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
single sponsor bill this uh prime
 
01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor is only one sponsor we just
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
passed a bill 1070 with one single
 
01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor and we had a robust debate so
 
01:26:41.110 --> 01:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to understand
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
where your comment about just one
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
sponsoring one bill a bill with just
 
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
single sponsor
 
01:26:51.669 --> 01:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
so i'm just i'm a little confused
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
if you could yes i i hear you
 
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
i was trying to offer some constructive
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
advice to the representative
 
01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh as
 
01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
as we consider new legislation
 
01:27:07.110 --> 01:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh it's helpful to have inputs from
 
01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
from others as well
 
01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
um and just kind of asked the
 
01:27:16.229 --> 01:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
counterpart to um
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative manjapudi's comment about
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
um yes we have passed
 
01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
bills with only single sponsors before
 
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
we've also
 
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
voted down
 
01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
bills with large lists of sponsors um
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
11 1119 the um bill to
 
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%

regulate single-use plastic bags that
 
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
had a giant list of sponsors and the
 
01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee still it's
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
certainly not a a uh
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
perfect science
 
01:27:54.149 --> 01:27:54.159 align:start position:0%

amendment
 
01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:52.870 align:start position:0%
amendment
2022-0562-h

01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:58.229 --> 01:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your
 
01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
amendment yes i would um when we had the
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
discussion about this bill
 
01:35:05.109 --> 01:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
uh nate graves from you know hansel new
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association sorry
 
01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh said that he thought that there might
 
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
be an issue
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
with the fact that
 
01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:15.679 align:start position:0%
we talked about adus in the bill
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
so since
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
this is really an issue of how many
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
units there are
 
01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
and some of them can be big and some of
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
them can be small there seem to be no
 
01:35:28.629 --> 01:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
reason to leave adu language in the bill
 
01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
so i have removed it
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
so what it says is you can have up you
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
can have up to an including four units
 
01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
which can be configured in a single four
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
unit building two duplexes a triple unit
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
or four have four townhouses
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
or four single units as in a cottage
 
01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:51.109 align:start position:0%
or four single units as in a cottage

01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:53.430 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
i recommend that we adopt it
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:58.870 --> 01:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on this
 
01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
bill yes representative again i know
 
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
some learning asking questions
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
does this make a difference whether
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
there's public water or sewer
 
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
well that's not part of the amendment
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
but i'm happy to ask answer that when we
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
get to
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
okay so are you okay to hold on that
 
01:36:18.159 --> 01:36:19.430 align:start position:0%
okay so are you okay to hold on that
thought

01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
thought
 
01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on the amendment
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:36:29.109 --> 01:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
uh during the the hearing on
 
01:36:32.239 --> 01:36:34.229 align:start position:0%
uh during the the hearing on
the

01:36:34.229 --> 01:36:34.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:34.239 --> 01:36:35.430 align:start position:0%
the
bill

01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:36.870 align:start position:0%
bill
uh

01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
a similar amendment was offered you know
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
this this amendment seems to be mostly
 
01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know uh housekeeping
 
01:36:51.189 --> 01:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
the question of uh requiring subdivision
 
01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:56.870 align:start position:0%
the question of uh requiring subdivision
uh

01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
because of uh
 
01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
say the two duplex units
 
01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:02.950 align:start position:0%
say the two duplex units
uh

01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
do you believe that
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
removes that
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
that requirement to subdivide the
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
property you would only have to
 
01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
subdivide if you did not set it up to
 
01:37:15.910 --> 01:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
sell as a condo
 
01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
what the bill says simply is that
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
you can build four units
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
which would be all on one lot
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
and you can put them in two buildings
 
01:37:29.830 --> 01:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
or four buildings or
 
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
one building
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
the issue of subdivision has to do with
 
01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:35.590 align:start position:0%
the issue of subdivision has to do with
ownership

01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
ownership
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
and would be handled in a different
 
01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh further discussion on the amendment
 
01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative loseless
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
representative van um and i could be uh
 
01:37:50.719 --> 01:37:51.590 align:start position:0%
representative van um and i could be uh
um

01:37:51.590 --> 01:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
off base but
 
01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment does
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
talk about served by municipal water and
 
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.750 align:start position:0%
talk about served by municipal water and
sewer

01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
but there doesn't seem to be anything in
 
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
that language
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
with respect to capacity
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
so if if
 
01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
a municipality
 
01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:18.310 align:start position:0%
a municipality
has

01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
municipal water and sewer
 
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
but there is a concern about capacity
 
01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:26.239 align:start position:0%
how would that affect
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
well that's not germane to the amendment
 
01:38:30.629 --> 01:38:30.639 align:start position:0%
but i'm happy to answer the question
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
the the answer is that the statutory
 
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
language in new hampshire says
 
01:38:39.109 --> 01:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
that if a proposal is brought forward to
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
the planning board they cannot be served
 
01:38:43.510 --> 01:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
by the existing water and sewer
 
01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure or other infrastructure
 
01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
including roads and schools
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
any further questions on the amendment
 
01:38:58.870 --> 01:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
amendment yes representative
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative just a quick question

and i'm happy to talk about that when we
 
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
get to the bill okay thank you

although this is uh
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
as a matter right allowing more dwelling
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
units than perhaps your
 
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.270 align:start position:0%
units than perhaps your
residential

01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
residential
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
zone may have you still have to
 
01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:30.149 align:start position:0%
zone may have you still have to
um

01:39:30.149 --> 01:39:30.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
adhere to any of your zoning that uh
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
talks about lawton yard setbacks and
 
01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
parking requirements and lot coverage so
 
01:39:42.629 --> 01:39:42.639 align:start position:0%
it will be probably be more dividing up
 
01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
a big single family than it will be
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
adding new units to
 
01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:47.590 align:start position:0%
adding new units to
um

01:39:47.590 --> 01:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
to a town
 
01:39:53.350 --> 01:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
thank you uh yes representative
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair like i spoke at
 
01:39:56.639 --> 01:39:57.510 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair like i spoke at
the

01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:59.590 --> 01:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
hearing public hearing
 
01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:00.550 align:start position:0%
hearing public hearing
this

01:40:00.550 --> 01:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
you know if you look at all the comments
 
01:40:05.669 --> 01:40:05.679 align:start position:0%
and stuff and i think representative van
 
01:40:08.470 --> 01:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
took the feedback from some of the
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
support adding
 
01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
you know to
 
01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
but it enables
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
baby boomers or people like me who want
 
01:40:22.709 --> 01:40:22.719 align:start position:0%
to age in place to stay in my home and
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
be able to do that
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
and this will
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
will not restrict
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
so this is a
 
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
good thing for
 
01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
our state and our community
 
01:40:37.750 --> 01:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
so further comments or questions
 
01:40:39.109 --> 01:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher did you have
 
01:40:39.119 --> 01:40:40.870 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher did you have
one

01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:41.830 align:start position:0%
one
um

01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:43.990 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:45.010 align:start position:0%
just um
 
01:40:45.010 --> 01:40:46.790 align:start position:0%
just um
[Music]

01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
to respond to representative mcdonald's
 
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
question about the as a matter of fact
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
um i'm thinking the reason that might
 
01:40:55.830 --> 01:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
stand out more in the memo is just
 
01:40:57.669 --> 01:40:57.679 align:start position:0%
because there were commas added around
 
01:40:58.950 --> 01:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
it even though
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
the language was there
 
01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
in the original
 
01:41:07.590 --> 01:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:08.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:41:08.550 --> 01:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:09.510 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:10.310 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
description of the amendment was mostly
 
01:41:14.310 --> 01:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
about the 80s portion but i'm also
 
01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:15.590 align:start position:0%
about the 80s portion but i'm also
seeing

01:41:15.590 --> 01:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
01:41:16.830 --> 01:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
a part
 
01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:18.390 align:start position:0%
a part
about

01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:19.270 align:start position:0%
about
um

01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
the parking requirements
 
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
and here looks changed from the original
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if representative van
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
could go more into detail about the
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
parking requirements
 
01:41:32.310 --> 01:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
that was actually in the amendment that
 
01:41:35.109 --> 01:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
we discussed at the original hearing
 
01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
um there had been some confusion about
 
01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
the parking so when we
 
01:41:41.590 --> 01:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
saw this bill initially
 
01:41:44.550 --> 01:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
on whatever day that was i had already
 
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
had an amendment so what we looked at on
 
01:41:49.109 --> 01:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
i think it was february 7th
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
was an amended bill that had the parking
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
okay any further discussion no comments
 
01:42:06.149 --> 01:42:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:10.960 align:start position:0%

01:43:09.189 --> 01:43:09.199 align:start position:0%

01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
since the amendment has failed i'd like
 
01:43:23.679 --> 01:43:24.390 align:start position:0%
since the amendment has failed i'd like
to

01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
no but i can speak up
 
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh since the amendment has failed i
 
01:43:33.990 --> 01:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
would still like to move ought to pass
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
on the underlying bill
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
so we have a motion is there a second
 
01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
right here
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay emotion's been made in second it's
 
01:43:49.109 --> 01:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
a discussion now on the motion ought to
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
pass i'd like to speak to my move to my
 
01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:53.030 align:start position:0%
pass i'd like to speak to my move to my
motion

01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%
there was a question about someone asked
 
01:43:58.390 --> 01:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
about why does it say municipal water
 
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
and sewer i'll answer that first there
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
are two reasons one of which is that it
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
is in the best interests of our towns
 
01:44:07.270 --> 01:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
cities and other areas
 
01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
to encourage further development where
 
01:44:11.590 --> 01:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
we already have infrastructure that's
 
01:44:14.070 --> 01:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
the sort of big overall picture the
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
second thing is that in terms of
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
financing um a four-unit building
 
01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
it is very difficult not to say
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
impossible to get financing from a bank
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
for a multi-unit building that does not
 
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
have water and sewer so that's the
 
01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
answer to that
 
01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
and um i am aware that this is an uphill
 
01:44:35.590 --> 01:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
battle but
 
01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
for 40 years the state of new hampshire
 
01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:39.430 align:start position:0%
for 40 years the state of new hampshire
has

01:44:39.430 --> 01:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:44:42.390 --> 01:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
has depended on the kindness of
 
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
individual towns and cities to provide
 
01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:46.470 align:start position:0%
individual towns and cities to provide
housing

01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:44:49.669 --> 01:44:49.679 align:start position:0%
that has left us more than 20 000 units
 
01:44:49.679 --> 01:44:51.270 align:start position:0%
that has left us more than 20 000 units
short

01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
short
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
if we continue
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
to leave it up to local control this is
 
01:44:59.350 --> 01:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
only going to get worse
 
01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
what happens when you have a desirable
 
01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:02.790 align:start position:0%
what happens when you have a desirable
place

01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
and a limited supply of housing
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
is that that limited supply is taken by
 
01:45:11.189 --> 01:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
the people with the most money which is
 
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
fine for them but it's a little hard on
 
01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
everyone else who needs to live there
 
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
one question we need to ask ourselves is
 
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
how far is it reasonable to ask a
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
bartender to drive home after her shift
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
if she can't live in the town where she
 
01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:28.470 align:start position:0%
if she can't live in the town where she
works

01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
works
 
01:45:30.629 --> 01:45:30.639 align:start position:0%
this is not a new idea
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh limiting allowing limited number
 
01:45:35.350 --> 01:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
limited size
 
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
of multi-families this is what's called
 
01:45:39.189 --> 01:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
the missing middle
 
01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
and we used to allow it we have plenty
 
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
of examples of it still in existence
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
but we can't build any more of it
 
01:45:50.709 --> 01:45:50.719 align:start position:0%
if we maintain our single-family only
 
01:45:50.719 --> 01:45:51.590 align:start position:0%
if we maintain our single-family only
zone

01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
zone
 
01:45:53.590 --> 01:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
does this mean that you can't build a
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
single-family house no it doesn't it
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
means that you have more choices
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
than simply a single family fewer than
 
01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
20 percent of all households in the
 
01:46:06.629 --> 01:46:06.639 align:start position:0%
united states consist of a mother and a
 
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
i will representative gallagher could
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:18.550 --> 01:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
please continue
 
01:46:20.189 --> 01:46:20.199 align:start position:0%
by the year
 
01:46:24.149 --> 01:46:24.159 align:start position:0%
2025 we expect more than 60 percent of
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
all households to be one in two-person
 
01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
households we've over-provided big
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
single-family households and
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
under-provided every other form of
 
01:46:36.229 --> 01:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
housing for the last 60 years we have
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
artificially constrained the production
 
01:46:38.159 --> 01:46:38.830 align:start position:0%
artificially constrained the production
of

01:46:38.830 --> 01:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%
housing one of the things that has come
 
01:46:43.990 --> 01:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
up in the last few years is there's been
 
01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
quite a lot of research including a uh
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
research project that was just con
 
01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:51.270 align:start position:0%
research project that was just con
concluded

01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
concluded
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
by the josiah bartlett institute which
 
01:46:55.270 --> 01:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
says that
 
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
when one town
 
01:46:57.520 --> 01:46:58.950 align:start position:0%
when one town
votes

01:46:58.950 --> 01:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
votes
 
01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
to make their zoning more restrictive to
 
01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:02.470 align:start position:0%
to make their zoning more restrictive to
recovery

01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
recovery
 
01:47:04.229 --> 01:47:04.239 align:start position:0%
require more
 
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
a larger lot longer frontages
 
01:47:09.669 --> 01:47:09.679 align:start position:0%
less coverage all of those things what
 
01:47:13.109 --> 01:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
happens is that the towns around it
 
01:47:15.669 --> 01:47:15.679 align:start position:0%
also adopt that and often become even
 
01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
more restrictive it's a death spiral and
 
01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
we have seen what has happened
 
01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
i've been looking at housing and local
 
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
local votes in new hampshire since 1982.
 
01:47:32.229 --> 01:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
we're not making any progress
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
this is not a novel idea it's been done
 
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
other places it simplifies the ability
 
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
to get a loan
 
01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
housing administration considers a
 
01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
fourplex a house
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
a fourplex is a house you get a plain
 
01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
beige vanilla loan for up to four units
 
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
this is not the kind of development that
 
01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
attracts big out of town developers this
 
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
is the kind of development that can be
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
done by two women in a pickup truck
 
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
it can be done by a little old woman who
 
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
lives in a house that's too big for her
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
it can be done by a young couple who
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
can't quite cover the mortgage with
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
their jobs
 
01:48:17.669 --> 01:48:17.679 align:start position:0%
they can make a conversion
 
01:48:20.070 --> 01:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
rent out that house
 
01:48:22.709 --> 01:48:22.719 align:start position:0%
i don't know what else to say
 
01:48:22.719 --> 01:48:24.070 align:start position:0%
i don't know what else to say
the

01:48:24.070 --> 01:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:48:26.229 --> 01:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
housing advocates favor this vote the
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire business and industry
 
01:48:30.790 --> 01:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
favors this bill the new hampshire
 
01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
business review wrote a long laudatory
 
01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:35.679 align:start position:0%
article about this bill
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:48:40.550 --> 01:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
the builders like this bill even though
 
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
as i said it's not a big bill for them
 
01:48:45.910 --> 01:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
the real estate agents like this bill
 
01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
the people on the far right like this
 
01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:49.590 align:start position:0%
the people on the far right like this
bill

01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:48:52.390 --> 01:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
the people who are worried about housing
 
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
like this bill
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
i just hate to see us
 
01:48:56.639 --> 01:48:58.390 align:start position:0%
i just hate to see us
decide

01:48:58.390 --> 01:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
decide
 
01:49:00.629 --> 01:49:00.639 align:start position:0%
that we don't care
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're going to be doing
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
it's not going to get better if we don't
 
01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:07.430 align:start position:0%
it's not going to get better if we don't
do

01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:09.109 align:start position:0%
do
something

01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
the rich get richer
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
and the poor live in their cars
 
01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:16.159 --> 01:49:19.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:21.189 --> 01:49:21.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and i think
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
we all can see how passionate
 
01:49:25.109 --> 01:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
representative van is about this issue i
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
seconded this motion
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
and i voted in favor of the adopting the
 
01:49:29.119 --> 01:49:30.070 align:start position:0%
and i voted in favor of the adopting the
amendment

01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:49:31.510 --> 01:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
because i'm a real estate broker i've
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
been a real estate broker for over 30
 
01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
years and i see this on the ground just
 
01:49:37.109 --> 01:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
like i see the trash
 
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
right on the ground i see this at the
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
level of individuals attempting to have
 
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
homes for their families in communities
 
01:49:47.109 --> 01:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
i see that
 
01:49:47.119 --> 01:49:48.149 align:start position:0%
i see that
young

01:49:48.149 --> 01:49:48.159 align:start position:0%
young
 
01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
couple who wants to buy a duplex or a
 
01:49:52.229 --> 01:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
four-plex so they can raise their family
 
01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
in it and have some income to help
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
support the maintenance of the building
 
01:49:58.229 --> 01:49:58.239 align:start position:0%
and they want to be in the community
 
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
i think this is an incredibly positive
 
01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:03.910 align:start position:0%
i think this is an incredibly positive
insightful

01:50:03.910 --> 01:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
insightful
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
and exciting opportunity for the state
 
01:50:07.589 --> 01:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
the idea that you can get a
 
01:50:11.830 --> 01:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
non-commercial loan
 
01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
on a four unit building
 
01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:14.870 align:start position:0%
on a four unit building
is

01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
brilliant it's very difficult to get a
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
commercial loan if you're not a business
 
01:50:21.189 --> 01:50:21.199 align:start position:0%
person it's very easy to get this kind
 
01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
of loan if you're employed and you have
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
a little bit of money for a down payment
 
01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
and and you can move forward
 
01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
and keep that building in the housing
 
01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:33.030 align:start position:0%
and keep that building in the housing
stock

01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
stock
 
01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
in the town that it's in i drove by all
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
those buildings the what's it called the
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
missing middle on my way here this
 
01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:46.629 --> 01:50:46.639 align:start position:0%
the places i drove by
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
from my house to the main highway are
 
01:50:50.550 --> 01:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
the places that could be the missing
 
01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:51.510 align:start position:0%
the places that could be the missing
middle

01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
middle
 
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
the ones that have
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
water and sewer provided by the
 
01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
community that could have an apartment
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
that could have another small building
 
01:51:01.109 --> 01:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
that could be made into two units
 
01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
because they're so big
 
01:51:04.709 --> 01:51:04.719 align:start position:0%
when i got to concord i drove by the
 
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
missing middle that already exists here
 
01:51:08.310 --> 01:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
and it's all around us it's all those
 
01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
big beautiful victorian buildings that
 
01:51:12.149 --> 01:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
were converted over time because they
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
were too big for the families
 
01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:15.679 align:start position:0%

study this was also referred to i mean
 
01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
we just got an email from
 
01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
a prime sponsor of another bill which
 
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
tries to address
 
01:51:59.109 --> 01:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
that is hb 1238 in terms of increasing
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
the housing stock
 
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
and this
 
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
you know even if i look at just my
 
01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
personal situation
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
where in my neighborhood which has 36
 
01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
single family homes
 
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
4 out of 36 has already added
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
a in-law apartment
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
to their unit to bring their aging
 
01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:24.149 align:start position:0%
to their unit to bring their aging
parents

01:52:24.149 --> 01:52:24.159 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:52:24.159 --> 01:52:25.350 align:start position:0%
parents
to

01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:52:26.790 --> 01:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
live with them
 
01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:27.589 align:start position:0%
live with them
and

01:52:27.589 --> 01:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:30.149 --> 01:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
i am getting there and i want my
 
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
children to be able to live in the same
 
01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
building or my dwelling so that i could
 
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
age gracefully in my own home and in my
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
own community where i have lived for 30
 
01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
plus years
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
so this
 
01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
addresses many issues missing middle
 
01:52:53.189 --> 01:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
aging in place
 
01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
and the acute shortage that we have in
 
01:52:58.390 --> 01:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
terms of housing
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
nashua city of nashua has
 
01:53:00.719 --> 01:53:01.669 align:start position:0%
nashua city of nashua has
five

01:53:01.669 --> 01:53:01.679 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:53:01.679 --> 01:53:02.790 align:start position:0%
five
thousand

01:53:02.790 --> 01:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
five three zero units shortage in a
 
01:53:10.390 --> 01:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
population of ninety thousand people
 
01:53:13.350 --> 01:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
and so that you know this is such a
 
01:53:15.030 --> 01:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
critical need
 
01:53:18.149 --> 01:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
and like uh representative ryan alluded
 
01:53:18.159 --> 01:53:18.870 align:start position:0%
and like uh representative ryan alluded
to

01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:53:23.189 --> 01:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
if we don't offer a roof over a head
 
01:53:26.310 --> 01:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
people poor people that are working two
 
01:53:31.270 --> 01:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
full-time jobs to adults live in a car
 
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
because they can't afford and there is
 
01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:34.790 align:start position:0%
because they can't afford and there is
no

01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
housing available
 
01:53:40.149 --> 01:53:40.159 align:start position:0%
so this is a critical need and i would
 
01:53:43.109 --> 01:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly support and please look
 
01:53:43.119 --> 01:53:44.149 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly support and please look
at

01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:53:46.950 --> 01:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
and this is not overburdening
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
the communities that don't have rural
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
communities to maintain the character if
 
01:53:54.790 --> 01:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:57.109 align:start position:0%
 
water

01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
water
 
01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
this does not apply to it
 
01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:01.510 align:start position:0%
this does not apply to it
so

01:54:01.510 --> 01:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
you know with that i would seriously
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
consider the merits in much needed
 
01:54:09.430 --> 01:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
housing that we need
 
01:54:11.669 --> 01:54:11.679 align:start position:0%
yesterday not tomorrow thank you
 
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative gilman
 
01:54:15.750 --> 01:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh
 
01:54:17.830 --> 01:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative manjapudi covered a
 
01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
little bit of what i wanted to say
 
01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:21.030 align:start position:0%
little bit of what i wanted to say
um

01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
this does i think this bill although i i
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
liked the amendment better um
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
provides for the need that we have but
 
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't impose
 
01:54:34.870 --> 01:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
the look of
 
01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:37.679 align:start position:0%
a town unless uh somebody's really
 
01:54:39.910 --> 01:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
aggressive about development and
 
01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
there's the you know people have their
 
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
hair on fire that their two-acre zoning
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
is going to be ruined by this but a lot
 
01:54:49.990 --> 01:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
of two-acre zoning isn't supported by
 
01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
water and sewer
 
01:54:55.109 --> 01:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
so that rural essence will will remain
 
01:54:57.750 --> 01:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
um and i i think this does a lot i think
 
01:55:00.070 --> 01:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
that the constraints of having to meet
 
01:55:01.109 --> 01:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
the lot
 
01:55:02.950 --> 01:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
requirements that are currently in place
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
in every town that has zoning ordinances
 
01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:08.390 align:start position:0%
in every town that has zoning ordinances
really

01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:55:09.910 --> 01:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
have limit
 
01:55:14.149 --> 01:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
what you can do yet get more housing
 
01:55:15.910 --> 01:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative lasallas
 
01:55:22.629 --> 01:55:22.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
01:55:24.149 --> 01:55:24.159 align:start position:0%
in my own
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
history here short term history
 
01:55:31.510 --> 01:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
i've actually been a co-sponsor of a
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
bill that was
 
01:55:35.589 --> 01:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
it was geared toward
 
01:55:38.310 --> 01:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
increasing workforce housing
 
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
so i've been very consistent in
 
01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:42.790 align:start position:0%
so i've been very consistent in
supporting

01:55:42.790 --> 01:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
01:55:46.550 --> 01:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
things that i feel would would improve
 
01:55:48.790 --> 01:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
the situation here in
 
01:55:51.430 --> 01:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:55:54.310 --> 01:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
we're in a situation now
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
where the lack of housing
 
01:56:01.189 --> 01:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
particularly workforce housing
 
01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:04.470 align:start position:0%
is a
detriment

01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
detriment
 
01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:07.679 align:start position:0%
to the overall long-term
 
01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
growth of the economy
 
01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
there's almost never a day when you turn
 
01:56:18.550 --> 01:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
on the news
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
that this crisis that we have
 
01:56:23.350 --> 01:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:56:25.510 --> 01:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
present on the news
 
01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
just this morning i heard that that an
 
01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:30.470 align:start position:0%
just this morning i heard that that an
employer

01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
employer
 
01:56:33.109 --> 01:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire is actually
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
building housing
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
for their employees
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
it has gotten to that point they have
 
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
valued employees who can't get housing
 
01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
the employer is actually building the
 
01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:49.030 align:start position:0%
the employer is actually building the
housing

01:56:49.030 --> 01:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
i think this bill
 
01:56:54.709 --> 01:56:54.719 align:start position:0%
with the requirement of
 
01:56:57.589 --> 01:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
municipal water and sewer
 
01:57:00.629 --> 01:57:00.639 align:start position:0%
is not is of little danger
 
01:57:00.639 --> 01:57:01.589 align:start position:0%
is not is of little danger
to

01:57:01.589 --> 01:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:57:05.189 --> 01:57:05.199 align:start position:0%
changing the rural character
 
01:57:05.199 --> 01:57:06.310 align:start position:0%
changing the rural character
of

01:57:06.310 --> 01:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:57:08.550 --> 01:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
the overwhelming
 
01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:09.430 align:start position:0%
the overwhelming
uh

01:57:09.430 --> 01:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
part of municipalities within the state
 
01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:14.629 align:start position:0%
part of municipalities within the state
so

01:57:14.629 --> 01:57:14.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
with all of that being said i will be
 
01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
supporting this
 
01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:21.990 align:start position:0%
supporting this
yes

01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:22.000 align:start position:0%

news because uh i it was i think the
 
01:57:36.629 --> 01:57:36.639 align:start position:0%
lead-off story last week last night
 
01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
and just last thursday we heard from
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
governor sununu about how the housing
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
crisis is impacting the health and the
 
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
future of our state
 
01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
we are best situated of anybody in state
 
01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
government right now at this moment to
 
01:57:53.589 --> 01:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
address that
 
01:57:56.709 --> 01:57:56.719 align:start position:0%
um so i want to reiterate what my
 
01:57:58.550 --> 01:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
colleague from litchfield said
 
01:58:00.470 --> 01:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
the other thing about this bill is
 
01:58:02.229 --> 01:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
owners on site
 
01:58:02.239 --> 01:58:03.109 align:start position:0%
owners on site
um

01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:04.790 --> 01:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
typically in something like this the
 
01:58:06.709 --> 01:58:06.719 align:start position:0%
owner lives there and is able to be
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
responsive so it raises the whole
 
01:58:10.629 --> 01:58:10.639 align:start position:0%
quality of the housing and the quality
 
01:58:12.470 --> 01:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
of life for people that
 
01:58:14.470 --> 01:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
are inhabiting that housing
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
i this isn't really going to apply much
 
01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
to merrimack because we don't have much
 
01:58:21.750 --> 01:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
housing that's served by both water and
 
01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:23.109 align:start position:0%
housing that's served by both water and
sewer

01:58:23.109 --> 01:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
sewer
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
but i can tell you i walk through
 
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
my neighborhood before my my knee issue
 
01:58:31.750 --> 01:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of there's a lot of
 
01:58:33.669 --> 01:58:33.679 align:start position:0%
in-law apartments on houses that you
 
01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
really don't see and they're rented out
 
01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:37.679 align:start position:0%
they would not be
 
01:58:40.629 --> 01:58:40.639 align:start position:0%
allowed under here we already allow
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
multiple family housing without this as
 
01:58:45.669 --> 01:58:45.679 align:start position:0%
long as it's rented to someone that's in
 
01:58:48.229 --> 01:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
the family so i don't see how this is
 
01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
going to impact
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
what our perception of what we want to
 
01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:53.589 align:start position:0%
what our perception of what we want to
be

01:58:53.589 --> 01:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
as much as we think it is
 
01:58:59.189 --> 01:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
and when you really get down to it it is
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
about private property owner rights
 
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
people own that property and if if they
 
01:59:07.430 --> 01:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
meet these these
 
01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:08.950 align:start position:0%
meet these these
requirements

01:59:08.950 --> 01:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
why should we tell them no you can't add
 
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
on an apartment or you can't add on on
 
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
three other apartments those people own
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
that own that land that's their land
 
01:59:20.629 --> 01:59:20.639 align:start position:0%
that they should be able to do what they
 
01:59:23.189 --> 01:59:23.199 align:start position:0%
want to do with it as long as it meets
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
current zoning requirements and building
 
01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
codes which is in this bill so i
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly support it i encourage my
 
01:59:33.910 --> 01:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
colleagues to do the same thank you
 
01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:37.109 align:start position:0%
colleagues to do the same thank you
representative

01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:38.790 --> 01:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for recognizing me
 
01:59:42.629 --> 01:59:42.639 align:start position:0%
again and thank you for your comments um
 
01:59:44.550 --> 01:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
the commentary regarding television show
 
01:59:45.830 --> 01:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
made me
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
remember something i want to tell you a
 
01:59:48.390 --> 01:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
little story
 
01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
very short i drove out of town yesterday
 
01:59:52.229 --> 01:59:52.239 align:start position:0%
and i drove on a side street i think
 
01:59:54.709 --> 01:59:54.719 align:start position:0%
it's called park street and it's part of
 
01:59:56.149 --> 01:59:56.159 align:start position:0%
a church and there's a homeless
 
01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
community there
 
02:00:00.229 --> 02:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
houseless community lots and lots of
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
people out in the parking lot in the wet
 
02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
in the cold with all their belongings in
 
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
their shopping carts
 
02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
arguing trying to do something with the
 
02:00:14.229 --> 02:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
my heart was breaking as i was driving
 
02:00:18.629 --> 02:00:18.639 align:start position:0%
by i took myself home and my husband and
 
02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
i were watching
 
02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
public television last night and there
 
02:00:24.070 --> 02:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
was a program on about workhouses
 
02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
and what workhouses were is where we put
 
02:00:28.709 --> 02:00:28.719 align:start position:0%
houseless people
 
02:00:31.750 --> 02:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
in the 18th and early 19th century and
 
02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
for your voluntary imprisonment they
 
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
called it labor
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
you got a bed
 
02:00:40.950 --> 02:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
three meals a day and a place to sleep
 
02:00:44.310 --> 02:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
considering what i saw in the morning or
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
early afternoon and what i saw on that
 
02:00:48.070 --> 02:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
television show
 
02:00:49.589 --> 02:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
my husband and i kind of looked at each
 
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
other and said
 
02:00:52.149 --> 02:00:52.159 align:start position:0%
you know that work house doesn't seem
 
02:00:54.070 --> 02:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
like a bad deal considering the
 
02:00:56.950 --> 02:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
alternatives what we're doing right now
 
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
leaving people
 
02:01:00.070 --> 02:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
out in the cold
 
02:01:01.830 --> 02:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
to face the elements
 
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
with nowhere to go
 
02:01:07.109 --> 02:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
i just wanted you to have that in your
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
head while you think about voting on
 
02:01:13.350 --> 02:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:15.109 --> 02:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak on
 
02:01:15.119 --> 02:01:17.270 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak on
this

02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:01:19.350 --> 02:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
i know i mentioned
 
02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
to a number of you that i don't own a tv
 
02:01:25.109 --> 02:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
so i'm sorry that i haven't been able to
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
keep up with the documentaries
 
02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:30.310 align:start position:0%
keep up with the documentaries
uh

02:01:30.310 --> 02:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
one of the problems
 
02:01:33.510 --> 02:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
02:01:36.390 --> 02:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
is it does speak to
 
02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh requiring
 
02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
water and sewage
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't speak to
 
02:01:43.589 --> 02:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
the adequacy
 
02:01:43.599 --> 02:01:45.189 align:start position:0%
the adequacy
uh

02:01:45.189 --> 02:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:01:45.199 --> 02:01:45.990 align:start position:0%
uh
of

02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:01:47.910 --> 02:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
it in a town
 
02:01:49.189 --> 02:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
i i would
 
02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:54.870 --> 02:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
should this be adopted
 
02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
then uh there'll be a number of units
 
02:01:59.109 --> 02:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
that are converted from you know the old
 
02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
houses into
 
02:02:01.510 --> 02:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
the four
 
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
residential dwelling units but
 
02:02:09.030 --> 02:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:11.990 align:start position:0%
 
any

02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:14.229 --> 02:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
increased density
 
02:02:16.229 --> 02:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh which would require
 
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
more water and sewage
 
02:02:20.310 --> 02:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned here
 
02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:21.430 align:start position:0%
mentioned here
uh

02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:24.870 --> 02:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:28.470 --> 02:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:30.790 --> 02:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
this assumes that
 
02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
all these
 
02:02:35.109 --> 02:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
residential dwelling units are going to
 
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
be either owner occupied
 
02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:38.310 align:start position:0%
be either owner occupied
or

02:02:38.310 --> 02:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:39.350 align:start position:0%
or
some

02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:02:40.950 --> 02:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
form of a rental
 
02:02:43.350 --> 02:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
or a condominium
 
02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:45.030 align:start position:0%
or a condominium
uh

02:02:45.030 --> 02:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:47.109 --> 02:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
the uh if not
 
02:02:47.119 --> 02:02:48.390 align:start position:0%
the uh if not
then

02:02:48.390 --> 02:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:02:49.589 --> 02:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
there's going to be
 
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
subdivision required
 
02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
since you can't own
 
02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:55.510 align:start position:0%
since you can't own
uh

02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
you can have two buildings
 
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh on a single lot
 
02:03:03.270 --> 02:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
that are not owned by the same person uh
 
02:03:05.669 --> 02:03:05.679 align:start position:0%
could you answer some of those questions
 
02:03:08.070 --> 02:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
yes i'd be delighted to all of those
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
issues are taken up other places in the
 
02:03:13.990 --> 02:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
land usage statutes two buildings can be
 
02:03:15.910 --> 02:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
owned by two different people on a
 
02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
single plot of land
 
02:03:19.750 --> 02:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
if you want to sell it you can
 
02:03:22.870 --> 02:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
condominiumize it condo condos are a
 
02:03:25.430 --> 02:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
form of ownership you can make a condo
 
02:03:27.669 --> 02:03:27.679 align:start position:0%
out of your bread box if you want to if
 
02:03:29.109 --> 02:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
you can get someone to live there and i
 
02:03:30.229 --> 02:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
think there might be people who are
 
02:03:32.709 --> 02:03:32.719 align:start position:0%
ready to move into a bread box
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh and as to the water and sewer as i've
 
02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:35.910 align:start position:0%
uh and as to the water and sewer as i've
said

02:03:35.910 --> 02:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:03:39.109 --> 02:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
over and over again there is language in
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
the statute which allows
 
02:03:45.109 --> 02:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
communities to deny a development based
 
02:03:47.030 --> 02:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
on inadequate services which includes
 
02:03:49.109 --> 02:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
water and sewer also if you're
 
02:03:51.510 --> 02:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
converting a house and your
 
02:03:54.149 --> 02:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
water pipe is not adequate
 
02:03:56.069 --> 02:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
then the town will require you to
 
02:03:58.870 --> 02:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
replace it if they don't have water for
 
02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
you they will say
 
02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
you can't do this because there's not
 
02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
enough water here
 
02:04:06.629 --> 02:04:06.639 align:start position:0%
they have the right to deny
 
02:04:09.109 --> 02:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
based on those issues i really do think
 
02:04:11.430 --> 02:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
that that's not a concern and
 
02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
additionally there is all of that
 
02:04:15.109 --> 02:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
language elsewhere
 
02:04:17.830 --> 02:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
in the land use statutes that address
 
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
the issues that you have raised
 
02:04:21.990 --> 02:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to add one other thing
 
02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
which i think i forgot to say in my
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
little jimmy stewart speech for you
 
02:04:28.629 --> 02:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
we uh
 
02:04:31.669 --> 02:04:31.679 align:start position:0%
we talk a lot about local control and
 
02:04:34.629 --> 02:04:34.639 align:start position:0%
not wanting to take away local control
 
02:04:37.669 --> 02:04:37.679 align:start position:0%
we already take away local control
 
02:04:39.910 --> 02:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
about issues having to do with hazardous
 
02:04:42.229 --> 02:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
waste water supply
 
02:04:42.239 --> 02:04:43.589 align:start position:0%
waste water supply
septic

02:04:43.589 --> 02:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
septic
 
02:04:43.599 --> 02:04:45.189 align:start position:0%
septic
garbage

02:04:45.189 --> 02:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
garbage
 
02:04:46.870 --> 02:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
witness the things we had this morning
 
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
about solid waste disposal those are all
 
02:04:51.510 --> 02:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
things that are designed decided at the
 
02:04:54.069 --> 02:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
state and they have one thing in common
 
02:04:57.189 --> 02:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
which is they affect the common good
 
02:04:59.270 --> 02:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
of the entire state
 
02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
i would argue that providing adequate
 
02:05:01.599 --> 02:05:02.709 align:start position:0%
i would argue that providing adequate
housing

02:05:02.709 --> 02:05:02.719 align:start position:0%
housing
 
02:05:06.790 --> 02:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
for our citizens is about the baseline
 
02:05:09.750 --> 02:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
of the common good
 
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh further discussion
 
02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:13.270 align:start position:0%
thank you uh further discussion
representative

02:05:13.270 --> 02:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:05:17.109 --> 02:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
just if i look at
 
02:05:20.550 --> 02:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
the taxes based on a single family home
 
02:05:23.350 --> 02:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
we have four bathrooms
 
02:05:25.750 --> 02:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
so our taxes is based on how many
 
02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:27.510 align:start position:0%
so our taxes is based on how many
bathrooms

02:05:27.510 --> 02:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
bathrooms
 
02:05:29.910 --> 02:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
we have in a single family home
 
02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:31.510 align:start position:0%
we have in a single family home
so

02:05:31.510 --> 02:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:33.510 --> 02:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
considering that there are four
 
02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:34.870 align:start position:0%
considering that there are four
bathrooms

02:05:34.870 --> 02:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
bathrooms
 
02:05:37.990 --> 02:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
in the house to convert that into a four
 
02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:39.510 align:start position:0%
in the house to convert that into a four
plux

02:05:39.510 --> 02:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
plux
 
02:05:43.589 --> 02:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
in terms of water usage wastewater
 
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change for the tax purposes
 
02:05:50.550 --> 02:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
or the zoning purposes just looking at
 
02:05:53.109 --> 02:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
my own situation
 
02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
so i mean we may not be using all um
 
02:05:59.589 --> 02:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
four bathrooms but we are paying taxes
 
02:06:01.589 --> 02:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
for all four bathrooms
 
02:06:03.990 --> 02:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
we are paying uh you know our usage
 
02:06:06.790 --> 02:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
based on the use of the things so
 
02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
this really does not
 
02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:12.229 align:start position:0%
this really does not
affect

02:06:12.229 --> 02:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:13.990 --> 02:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:15.030 align:start position:0%
in terms of
public

02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:06:17.510 --> 02:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
sewer and water supply which already
 
02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:18.629 align:start position:0%
sewer and water supply which already
exists

02:06:18.629 --> 02:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
exists
 
02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
in a single family with a specific lot
 
02:06:26.149 --> 02:06:26.159 align:start position:0%
and so i think without having to change
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
major structure
 
02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know it would help somebody like me
 
02:06:34.149 --> 02:06:34.159 align:start position:0%
to say i can afford because i get calls
 
02:06:36.390 --> 02:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
every day from the university that's
 
02:06:39.669 --> 02:06:39.679 align:start position:0%
close by can you house a uh student
 
02:06:41.669 --> 02:06:41.679 align:start position:0%
right now we cannot other than if i take
 
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
them and as my family member to uh house
 
02:06:47.109 --> 02:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
them or you know
 
02:06:49.750 --> 02:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
so many professionals that are moving in
 
02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
they can't find a place
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
there's a is there a place to uh hold so
 
02:06:54.719 --> 02:06:56.149 align:start position:0%
there's a is there a place to uh hold so
this

02:06:56.149 --> 02:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:06:56.159 --> 02:06:58.790 align:start position:0%
this
allows

02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
allows
 
02:07:01.830 --> 02:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
people who currently exist in a single
 
02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
family home
 
02:07:06.790 --> 02:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
to age in place gracefully and
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
be part of a community and grow the
 
02:07:12.550 --> 02:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
community that i want to see
 
02:07:14.709 --> 02:07:14.719 align:start position:0%
that i want to be part of and not have
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
to move out of the community that i live
 
02:07:18.149 --> 02:07:18.159 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:07:19.189 --> 02:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:07:21.030 --> 02:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
did you hear
 
02:07:23.189 --> 02:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
i take the prerogative of our haunted
 
02:07:26.229 --> 02:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
guests and i move the question
 
02:07:28.069 --> 02:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
mr chair i'd actually like to say
 
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
something further before we move the
 
02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:31.430 align:start position:0%
something further before we move the
questions

02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:07:33.990 --> 02:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
to be uh made on this
 
02:07:35.830 --> 02:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
i would actually like to say you get the
 
02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
last word the power of the last word
 
02:07:41.189 --> 02:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that i noticed when
 
02:07:43.669 --> 02:07:43.679 align:start position:0%
we exec when we had the hearing on this
 
02:07:47.189 --> 02:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
bill was who showed up to talk for it
 
02:07:49.669 --> 02:07:49.679 align:start position:0%
we had a developer come and say i'd
 
02:07:51.189 --> 02:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
actually like to build this kind of
 
02:07:53.270 --> 02:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
housing but right now i can't because my
 
02:07:55.990 --> 02:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
zoning doesn't allow it
 
02:07:58.310 --> 02:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
i talked to
 
02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
people from the real estate agencies
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
from the builders
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
all of them thought that this was a bill
 
02:08:07.510 --> 02:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
that could increase our housing supply
 
02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:08.950 align:start position:0%
that could increase our housing supply
without

02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:08:12.870 --> 02:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
damaging the character of our places
 
02:08:16.629 --> 02:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
these are house sized buildings
 
02:08:19.109 --> 02:08:19.119 align:start position:0%
it's quite clear in the bill that you
 
02:08:23.910 --> 02:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
can't build a 150 unit garden apartment
 
02:08:26.390 --> 02:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
you can build a building that is the
 
02:08:29.669 --> 02:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
same size as a house
 
02:08:32.149 --> 02:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
it's just a house
 
02:08:35.030 --> 02:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
i think that it is
 
02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's astonishing that we have
 
02:08:40.069 --> 02:08:40.079 align:start position:0%
not already
 
02:08:42.629 --> 02:08:42.639 align:start position:0%
made some strides in this direction
 
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
manchester 79 of manchester is owned
 
02:08:47.589 --> 02:08:47.599 align:start position:0%
single-family only in spite of the
 
02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
presence of all of those historic triple
 
02:08:50.880 --> 02:08:51.910 align:start position:0%
presence of all of those historic triple
deckers

02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
deckers
 
02:08:55.270 --> 02:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
four plexes dignified small apartment
 
02:08:57.750 --> 02:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
buildings they're illegal you can't
 
02:09:00.149 --> 02:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
build any more of them
 
02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
even though those are some of the
 
02:09:04.550 --> 02:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods we love best
 
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
and that people want to live in
 
02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
this part of the crisis that we're
 
02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
having is because the kinds of places
 
02:09:13.350 --> 02:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
that everyone wants to live almost
 
02:09:15.830 --> 02:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
everyone many people let's put it that
 
02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:16.709 align:start position:0%
everyone many people let's put it that
way

02:09:16.709 --> 02:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
are the places we're not building any
 
02:09:19.910 --> 02:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
more of
 
02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
walkable places where my eight-year-old
 
02:09:25.990 --> 02:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
can ride her bicycle and buy a popsicle
 
02:09:28.709 --> 02:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
where my 84 year old mother-in-law can
 
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
walk and buy a quart of milk
 
02:09:34.229 --> 02:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
those places are expensive
 
02:09:37.030 --> 02:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
because we're not making any more
 
02:09:42.149 --> 02:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
i suggest that we allow those places to
 
02:09:48.709 --> 02:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:52.310 --> 02:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative
 
02:10:05.589 --> 02:10:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:05.599 --> 02:10:07.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:10:07.830 --> 02:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:09.750 --> 02:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
i know there were a number of reasons
 
02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:10.790 align:start position:0%
i know there were a number of reasons
why

02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:11.830 align:start position:0%
why
um

02:10:11.830 --> 02:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:13.990 --> 02:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
there was restrictions on certain
 
02:10:16.149 --> 02:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
building and building areas
 
02:10:18.390 --> 02:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
there had to be a reason for it
 
02:10:20.550 --> 02:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
um just the last
 
02:10:21.990 --> 02:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
bill of the bill before that we were
 
02:10:24.390 --> 02:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
talking about local control and we were
 
02:10:26.310 --> 02:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
02:10:28.550 --> 02:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know saying there wasn't enough
 
02:10:30.390 --> 02:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
local control we had to
 
02:10:32.550 --> 02:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh do something and now we have too much
 
02:10:34.149 --> 02:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
local control and they want to take it
 
02:10:35.589 --> 02:10:35.599 align:start position:0%
away from that
 
02:10:38.950 --> 02:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
um i know the nhma if i'm not mistaken
 
02:10:40.870 --> 02:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
opposed this bill and they said that it
 
02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:41.830 align:start position:0%
opposed this bill and they said that it
was

02:10:41.830 --> 02:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
basically um not ready
 
02:10:46.390 --> 02:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh not prime time or something like
 
02:10:50.149 --> 02:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
someone along mostly i'm sorry
 
02:10:50.159 --> 02:10:51.189 align:start position:0%
someone along mostly i'm sorry
yeah

02:10:51.189 --> 02:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:10:53.589 --> 02:10:53.599 align:start position:0%
and that was because of thanking
 
02:10:56.310 --> 02:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
representative gilman because the adus
 
02:10:58.149 --> 02:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:11:01.030 --> 02:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's really all i have to say on that
 
02:11:03.189 --> 02:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
i think local control should stay as low
 
02:11:03.199 --> 02:11:04.310 align:start position:0%
i think local control should stay as low
control

02:11:04.310 --> 02:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
control
 
02:11:07.030 --> 02:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
and let the towns decide whether cities
 
02:11:10.470 --> 02:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
decide where they're going with it
 
02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
again we are legislating
 
02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:14.149 align:start position:0%
again we are legislating
something

02:11:14.149 --> 02:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:11:16.229 --> 02:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
that allows them to do what
 
02:11:19.109 --> 02:11:19.119 align:start position:0%
they would do according to this bill but
 
02:11:19.119 --> 02:11:20.550 align:start position:0%
they would do according to this bill but
again

02:11:20.550 --> 02:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:11:22.950 --> 02:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
it does take away from the contract yes
 
02:11:26.069 --> 02:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
it does oh sorry i thought you had waved
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
at me
 
02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to uh
 
02:11:31.030 --> 02:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
use the chairman's privilege here to
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
call on one other person that i need i'd
 
02:11:36.790 --> 02:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:40.069 --> 02:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
and that's representative
 
02:11:41.270 --> 02:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
in your
 
02:11:43.510 --> 02:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
travels around in conducting your
 
02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:44.629 align:start position:0%
travels around in conducting your
business

02:11:44.629 --> 02:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:11:44.639 --> 02:11:46.310 align:start position:0%
business
in

02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:11:47.669 --> 02:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
real estate
 
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you're you're observing
 
02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of different things i'd like to
 
02:11:54.069 --> 02:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
hear from you
 
02:11:55.669 --> 02:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
how you feel about
 
02:11:58.870 --> 02:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
the issue of zoning how it impacts
 
02:12:01.750 --> 02:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh housing availability and
 
02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:03.350 align:start position:0%
uh housing availability and
um

02:12:03.350 --> 02:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
the use of adu is if there if the
 
02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:06.390 align:start position:0%
the use of adu is if there if the
if

02:12:06.390 --> 02:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:12:08.950 --> 02:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
people are actually using them as we
 
02:12:12.149 --> 02:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
design as we design the legislation
 
02:12:14.069 --> 02:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
around them and just like to get your
 
02:12:14.079 --> 02:12:15.510 align:start position:0%
around them and just like to get your
anecdotal

02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
anecdotal
 
02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:16.709 align:start position:0%
anecdotal
response

02:12:16.709 --> 02:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
response
 
02:12:18.310 --> 02:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
mr chair thank you so much for the
 
02:12:21.350 --> 02:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
question i feel like my
 
02:12:24.149 --> 02:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
experience in the trenches is paying off
 
02:12:26.629 --> 02:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
right at this very moment
 
02:12:28.470 --> 02:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
in answer to your second question first
 
02:12:30.550 --> 02:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
people are absolutely using the
 
02:12:33.750 --> 02:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to put in an adu
 
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
in the property they already own and
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
they're absolutely using the opportunity
 
02:12:41.510 --> 02:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
to look for a property in which an adu
 
02:12:44.470 --> 02:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
could be added now or in the future and
 
02:12:45.910 --> 02:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
they're thinking of all of the
 
02:12:47.589 --> 02:12:47.599 align:start position:0%
generations that we were talking about
 
02:12:49.750 --> 02:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative manjuputi
 
02:12:52.470 --> 02:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
children parents and grandparents very
 
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
multi-generation generational
 
02:12:57.270 --> 02:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
housing opportunities and people are
 
02:12:59.189 --> 02:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
really looking for that
 
02:12:59.199 --> 02:13:00.069 align:start position:0%
really looking for that
in

02:13:00.069 --> 02:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:13:02.229 --> 02:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
in the in the context of the market
 
02:13:03.510 --> 02:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:04.550 align:start position:0%
right now
um

02:13:04.550 --> 02:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:06.069 --> 02:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
you know as a seller you may think it's
 
02:13:08.229 --> 02:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of fun to get multi offers well
 
02:13:10.550 --> 02:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's not because you're deciding on
 
02:13:12.629 --> 02:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
someone else's future and you've got
 
02:13:14.709 --> 02:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
eight people sitting in front of you and
 
02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
it's pretty painful process to pick one
 
02:13:19.990 --> 02:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
and those people are all looking for the
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
02:13:23.109 --> 02:13:23.119 align:start position:0%
a nice place to live somewhere for their
 
02:13:24.470 --> 02:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
family to be
 
02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
something they can afford and something
 
02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
that they will stay in for quite a while
 
02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
i i don't see i see people who are
 
02:13:33.030 --> 02:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
flippers who are investors but not as
 
02:13:34.790 --> 02:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
many as there used to be
 
02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
in answer to the
 
02:13:38.950 --> 02:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
second part of your question could you
 
02:13:40.629 --> 02:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
remind me of what you said at the
 
02:13:42.310 --> 02:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
beginning because now i lost my train of
 
02:13:44.870 --> 02:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
thought it was
 
02:13:47.910 --> 02:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
the impact of zoning oh thank you yes um
 
02:13:50.149 --> 02:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
the impact of zoning is huge
 
02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
on towns cities municipalities
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
some of what
 
02:13:56.790 --> 02:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
we see in
 
02:13:58.709 --> 02:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
smaller towns and communities used to be
 
02:14:00.470 --> 02:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
referred to and may still be by some
 
02:14:01.750 --> 02:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
people and you're not supposed to say
 
02:14:03.750 --> 02:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
this as snob zoning
 
02:14:07.109 --> 02:14:07.119 align:start position:0%
meaning they require a large lot so only
 
02:14:09.109 --> 02:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
somebody with a lot of money or
 
02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
resources behind them could purchase
 
02:14:13.830 --> 02:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
that lot
 
02:14:15.589 --> 02:14:15.599 align:start position:0%
that seems to be going out of favor
 
02:14:17.189 --> 02:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
although they're not rezoning those
 
02:14:17.199 --> 02:14:18.390 align:start position:0%
although they're not rezoning those
places

02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
places
 
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
they are what they are going forward
 
02:14:22.229 --> 02:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
towns are more
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
towns and cities are more
 
02:14:26.629 --> 02:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
amenable to looking at what is called
 
02:14:28.149 --> 02:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
cluster zoning
 
02:14:30.310 --> 02:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
or a pud which is a planned unit
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
development which is a circle or a
 
02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
square or a couple of circles or squares
 
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
of houses with empty with conservation
 
02:14:40.550 --> 02:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
land around that so you have more open
 
02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:41.830 align:start position:0%
land around that so you have more open
space

02:14:41.830 --> 02:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
space
 
02:14:44.790 --> 02:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
the same number of houses just on a on a
 
02:14:47.109 --> 02:14:47.119 align:start position:0%
building lot so zoning definitely
 
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
affects it
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
and oh there was something else i wanted
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:57.990 --> 02:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
i think that this bill um
 
02:15:00.069 --> 02:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
allows cities and towns
 
02:15:01.830 --> 02:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
to make their own decisions based on
 
02:15:03.830 --> 02:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
their building codes and based i mean
 
02:15:05.270 --> 02:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
the state building code obviously
 
02:15:06.709 --> 02:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
overrides but
 
02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
not but yet in their building codes and
 
02:15:10.550 --> 02:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
their zoning codes and what they want
 
02:15:13.830 --> 02:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
their community to look like um the
 
02:15:16.229 --> 02:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
market is definitely out there for this
 
02:15:18.709 --> 02:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
sort of building big developers want to
 
02:15:21.109 --> 02:15:21.119 align:start position:0%
do big developments and i don't fault
 
02:15:22.790 --> 02:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
them at all they that's how they make
 
02:15:24.950 --> 02:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
money we all make a living
 
02:15:27.270 --> 02:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
small developers meaning that you know
 
02:15:29.189 --> 02:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
mom and pop shop who
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
live in barrington but they own a house
 
02:15:33.750 --> 02:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
which is a duplex in dover and they
 
02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
maintain that house you know that's
 
02:15:37.510 --> 02:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
their retirement income and the more
 
02:15:39.270 --> 02:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
that we can do that for people and then
 
02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
they could retire there in dover sell
 
02:15:42.870 --> 02:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
the house in barrington because they
 
02:15:44.790 --> 02:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
don't need a big single family anymore
 
02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:45.750 align:start position:0%
don't need a big single family anymore
and

02:15:45.750 --> 02:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:15:47.910 --> 02:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
going forward sorry i was long-winded
 
02:15:52.390 --> 02:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
thank you uh i value your inputs and
 
02:15:54.790 --> 02:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
i think i learned something thank you
 
02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:55.669 align:start position:0%
i think i learned something thank you
yes

02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:15:59.030 --> 02:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:01.430 --> 02:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
i agree with
 
02:16:03.589 --> 02:16:03.599 align:start position:0%
taking older big houses
 
02:16:06.390 --> 02:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
and making apartments out of them
 
02:16:08.709 --> 02:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
i like the idea that you can walk to the
 
02:16:08.719 --> 02:16:10.470 align:start position:0%
i like the idea that you can walk to the
store

02:16:10.470 --> 02:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
store
 
02:16:12.870 --> 02:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
but what i'm afraid of as you pass this
 
02:16:16.149 --> 02:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
bill it's for the whole state
 
02:16:19.270 --> 02:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
so if there's a small lot in your town
 
02:16:23.030 --> 02:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
that's been a lot forever but it's tiny
 
02:16:25.109 --> 02:16:25.119 align:start position:0%
and you have a nice ranch house on this
 
02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
side and a nice one on this side and you
 
02:16:30.149 --> 02:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
just live in there someone can come in
 
02:16:32.389 --> 02:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
and put a four unit building right
 
02:16:33.830 --> 02:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
between them
 
02:16:35.509 --> 02:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
and i want to know how many people in
 
02:16:37.509 --> 02:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
this room
 
02:16:40.469 --> 02:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
are willing to have a brand new four
 
02:16:41.910 --> 02:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
unit apartment
 
02:16:43.910 --> 02:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
house next to their house
 
02:16:45.669 --> 02:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
that's that's a good question but i'm
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
not going to pull the committee on uh mr
 
02:16:50.150 --> 02:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
chairman i just want to i'd actually
 
02:16:51.669 --> 02:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
like to respond to that when i get a
 
02:16:53.270 --> 02:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
minute representative davis that had a
 
02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:55.830 align:start position:0%
minute representative davis that had a
comment

02:16:55.830 --> 02:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:58.230 --> 02:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
trying to remember what it was
 
02:16:59.669 --> 02:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:17:01.509 --> 02:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
yes now i remember
 
02:17:04.070 --> 02:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
i wanted to address representative
 
02:17:06.549 --> 02:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
tripp's concern about water and sewer
 
02:17:09.990 --> 02:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
and i serve on um a large planting boat
 
02:17:13.910 --> 02:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
that serves a very large city lebanon
 
02:17:17.669 --> 02:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
and we have in fact denied
 
02:17:17.679 --> 02:17:19.509 align:start position:0%
and we have in fact denied
applicants

02:17:19.509 --> 02:17:19.519 align:start position:0%
applicants
 
02:17:21.429 --> 02:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
that want to put up developments that
 
02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
exceed our utility capacity our water
 
02:17:26.629 --> 02:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
and sewage capacity we have denied those
 
02:17:28.150 --> 02:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
and we don't need the legislature's
 
02:17:29.750 --> 02:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
permission to do that
 
02:17:31.270 --> 02:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
it's in our current
 
02:17:31.280 --> 02:17:32.230 align:start position:0%
it's in our current
local

02:17:32.230 --> 02:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
local
 
02:17:34.309 --> 02:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
zoning regs
 
02:17:36.870 --> 02:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
that are supported by state statute so
 
02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:37.589 align:start position:0%
that are supported by state statute so
that

02:17:37.589 --> 02:17:37.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:17:39.429 --> 02:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
just to you know put your mind at ease
 
02:17:42.070 --> 02:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
about the water and sewage issue and the
 
02:17:44.309 --> 02:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
second point i wanted to make really a
 
02:17:45.990 --> 02:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
point is just an
 
02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
anecdote which is that i live
 
02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:50.150 align:start position:0%
anecdote which is that i live
in

02:17:50.150 --> 02:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:17:51.830 --> 02:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
what i guess you would call the planned
 
02:17:54.070 --> 02:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
unit development it's single-family
 
02:17:56.389 --> 02:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
homes it's a lot of single-family homes
 
02:17:58.230 --> 02:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
really close together
 
02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
and when it was built 22 years ago
 
02:18:03.750 --> 02:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
it was about the most controversial
 
02:18:06.389 --> 02:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
thing in the city of lebanon and now
 
02:18:08.870 --> 02:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
there are waiting lists for people
 
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
wanting to buy those homes it is it's
 
02:18:13.349 --> 02:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
the hottest place to live in the entire
 
02:18:14.629 --> 02:18:14.639 align:start position:0%
upper valley
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
and so i support this bill
 
02:18:19.589 --> 02:18:19.599 align:start position:0%
we need more housing the housing that
 
02:18:22.309 --> 02:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
will be built
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes
 
02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
will be done by most likely by local
 
02:18:30.870 --> 02:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
craftspeople local laborers bringing
 
02:18:33.190 --> 02:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
more jobs to more people
 
02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
and as i've always said
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
home is where jobs go to sleep at night
 
02:18:41.589 --> 02:18:41.599 align:start position:0%
and if we want to keep our workers in
 
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
the state if we want to keep our
 
02:18:45.349 --> 02:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
grandparents and our grandkids in the
 
02:18:45.359 --> 02:18:46.389 align:start position:0%
grandparents and our grandkids in the
state

02:18:46.389 --> 02:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
it's just as simple as two plus two
 
02:18:53.190 --> 02:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
equals four they need places to live
 
02:18:56.070 --> 02:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative van impe yes
 
02:18:58.150 --> 02:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
i just have one last thing to say which
 
02:19:01.589 --> 02:19:01.599 align:start position:0%
is oh sorry can i ask you just keep it
 
02:19:04.469 --> 02:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
sure it is uh to the question about
 
02:19:06.549 --> 02:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
would i want a four unit building next
 
02:19:07.589 --> 02:19:07.599 align:start position:0%
to me
 
02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
i'll remind you that the bill says that
 
02:19:11.669 --> 02:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
that building can't be any bigger than a
 
02:19:13.830 --> 02:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
single family house and it has to
 
02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
provide the same amount of parking per
 
02:19:15.679 --> 02:19:16.709 align:start position:0%
provide the same amount of parking per
unit

02:19:16.709 --> 02:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
unit
 
02:19:19.589 --> 02:19:19.599 align:start position:0%
as a single family house does so i would
 
02:19:21.910 --> 02:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
argue that if that lot is small they
 
02:19:24.070 --> 02:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
can't get a four unit four units on it
 
02:19:25.509 --> 02:19:25.519 align:start position:0%
because they're going to exceed the lot
 
02:19:27.990 --> 02:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
coverage lots of towns have a 35 percent
 
02:19:29.830 --> 02:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
lot coverage requirement
 
02:19:31.429 --> 02:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
if you've got
 
02:19:34.070 --> 02:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
an 8 000 square foot lot of record that
 
02:19:35.830 --> 02:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
means that you can't build a building
 
02:19:38.790 --> 02:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
that is bigger than you know the house
 
02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
that would fit on it it's pretty small
 
02:19:50.230 --> 02:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:51.990 --> 02:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i've been listening
 
02:19:54.309 --> 02:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
very intently to to all the inputs here
 
02:19:56.389 --> 02:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
and i just had a quick question what is
 
02:19:59.349 --> 02:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
the um typical or
 
02:20:01.910 --> 02:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
typical amount of parking for a single
 
02:20:04.469 --> 02:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
family home i'm just curious
 
02:20:07.510 --> 02:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:12.469 align:start position:0%
 
two

02:20:12.469 --> 02:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:14.070 --> 02:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to answer the parking
 
02:20:16.950 --> 02:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
question most cities towns and villages
 
02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
have repo have an off-street parking
 
02:20:20.630 --> 02:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
requirement of two
 
02:20:23.830 --> 02:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh stalls of off-street parking per unit
 
02:20:26.150 --> 02:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
which actually means that that's another
 
02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
constraint on this production because
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
lots of lots that might accommodate a
 
02:20:31.200 --> 02:20:32.389 align:start position:0%
lots of lots that might accommodate a
house

02:20:32.389 --> 02:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:20:35.190 --> 02:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
won't accommodate the parking so instead
 
02:20:37.030 --> 02:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
of getting four units you'll only get
 
02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:38.389 align:start position:0%
of getting four units you'll only get
two

02:20:38.389 --> 02:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:20:39.910 --> 02:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you out of respect for
 
02:20:41.510 --> 02:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie we're going to
 
02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:45.840 align:start position:0%

so let's uh
 
02:20:50.710 --> 02:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
try to remember where we are
 
02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:52.880 align:start position:0%

representative gallagher
 
02:29:01.830 --> 02:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
um this is
 
02:29:03.750 --> 02:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
authorizing the establishment of
 
02:29:06.710 --> 02:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
revolving funds correct that seemed like
 
02:29:08.630 --> 02:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
a reasonable idea
 
02:29:11.590 --> 02:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
to me so i would like to hear
 
02:29:13.990 --> 02:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
some reasons as to why
 
02:29:16.309 --> 02:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
people oppose it if
 
02:29:19.429 --> 02:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
they're willing to do so
 
02:29:20.830 --> 02:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
well we haven't had
 
02:29:23.190 --> 02:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
anybody declare their opposition to the
 
02:29:30.389 --> 02:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:34.230 --> 02:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
but we do have a motion to itl
 
02:29:35.349 --> 02:29:35.359 align:start position:0%
would anybody like to take
 
02:29:38.389 --> 02:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher's challenge up
 
02:29:41.110 --> 02:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:29:43.349 --> 02:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
yes i feel that we shouldn't be telling
 
02:29:43.359 --> 02:29:44.630 align:start position:0%
yes i feel that we shouldn't be telling
towns

02:29:44.630 --> 02:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
towns
 
02:29:48.950 --> 02:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:50.389 --> 02:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
i think we're interfering with their
 
02:29:52.710 --> 02:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
budgets and everything else
 
02:29:56.389 --> 02:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
um if i may respond um i believe this is
 
02:29:59.510 --> 02:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation which
 
02:30:02.469 --> 02:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
means we're not telling them
 
02:30:03.750 --> 02:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
it means we're not telling them what
 
02:30:05.270 --> 02:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
they can do
 
02:30:07.030 --> 02:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
with their budgets we're just giving

02:30:38.230 --> 02:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
found several clericals in the bill
 
02:30:39.429 --> 02:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
it was agreed that they were clericals
 
02:30:44.230 --> 02:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
and uh i don't see an amendment so this
 
02:30:44.240 --> 02:30:45.110 align:start position:0%
and uh i don't see an amendment so this
bill

02:30:45.110 --> 02:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:30:47.750 --> 02:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
is still flawed
 
02:30:49.110 --> 02:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
02:30:49.120 --> 02:30:49.990 align:start position:0%
that's why
i

02:30:49.990 --> 02:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:30:54.150 --> 02:30:54.160 align:start position:0%

majori
 
02:31:01.190 --> 02:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
02:31:04.550 --> 02:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
i am going to vote oppose the itl
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
we are
 
02:31:08.550 --> 02:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
as we learn simply matching language
 
02:31:11.270 --> 02:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
which exists in statute already in rsa
 
02:31:11.280 --> 02:31:12.710 align:start position:0%
which exists in statute already in rsa
35

02:31:12.710 --> 02:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
35
 
02:31:14.550 --> 02:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
so that counties
 
02:31:16.550 --> 02:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
cities and village districts can have
 
02:31:19.510 --> 02:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
the authority to create a revolving fund
 
02:31:20.790 --> 02:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
for the
 
02:31:23.349 --> 02:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
for better fiscal management it seems to
 
02:31:25.349 --> 02:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
me that this bill
 
02:31:27.990 --> 02:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
is even a bit of housekeeping that makes
 
02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of sense and i would hope
 
02:31:31.110 --> 02:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:31:33.110 --> 02:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
committee would vote against the itl so
 
02:31:34.630 --> 02:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
another motion can be made thank you
 
02:31:34.640 --> 02:31:36.630 align:start position:0%
another motion can be made thank you
representative

02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:31:38.550 --> 02:31:38.560 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:31:41.510 --> 02:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:31:43.349 --> 02:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
we just talked about the elephant in the
 
02:31:45.750 --> 02:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
room the word shall
 
02:31:47.830 --> 02:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
if i look at the spill
 
02:31:49.830 --> 02:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
i don't see shell
 
02:31:55.830 --> 02:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
i see may a county may a city may
 
02:31:58.710 --> 02:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
a may is an enabling
 
02:32:01.510 --> 02:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
bill and gives the authority local
 
02:32:06.389 --> 02:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
authority to establish a revolving fund
 
02:32:06.399 --> 02:32:07.750 align:start position:0%
authority to establish a revolving fund
as

02:32:07.750 --> 02:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:32:07.760 --> 02:32:09.030 align:start position:0%
as
needed

02:32:09.030 --> 02:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
needed
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
to that community
 
02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
and if we really honor and cherish and
 
02:32:16.319 --> 02:32:17.590 align:start position:0%
and if we really honor and cherish and
enable

02:32:17.590 --> 02:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
enable
 
02:32:20.550 --> 02:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
the local authority this is the bill to
 
02:32:23.590 --> 02:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
support so with that in mind
 
02:32:26.710 --> 02:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
this is my first term but i'm learning
 
02:32:29.270 --> 02:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
fast in terms of what this committee
 
02:32:29.280 --> 02:32:30.150 align:start position:0%
fast in terms of what this committee
does

02:32:30.150 --> 02:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
does
 
02:32:33.190 --> 02:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
and so this is an enabling bill and i
 
02:32:36.230 --> 02:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
would be voting against itl
 
02:32:37.349 --> 02:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:32:39.429 --> 02:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
uh we can
 
02:32:43.030 --> 02:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:45.190 --> 02:32:45.200 align:start position:0%

as
 
02:33:57.030 --> 02:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
i'm still trying to learn a lot of the
 
02:33:59.030 --> 02:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
differences between villages and cities
 
02:33:59.040 --> 02:34:00.070 align:start position:0%
differences between villages and cities
and

02:34:00.070 --> 02:34:00.080 align:start position:0%

and and towns and so on does it make a
 
02:34:04.469 --> 02:34:04.479 align:start position:0%
difference that the word county is in
 
02:34:07.830 --> 02:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
there right does anybody
 
02:34:10.309 --> 02:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes having
 
02:34:12.070 --> 02:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
i sit on the county
 
02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:14.070 align:start position:0%
i sit on the county
uh

02:34:14.070 --> 02:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:34:15.670 --> 02:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
what do you call it
 
02:34:19.270 --> 02:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
delegation or executive uh committee uh
 
02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:20.070 align:start position:0%
delegation or executive uh committee uh
and

02:34:20.070 --> 02:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:22.230 --> 02:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
county also has a
 
02:34:24.389 --> 02:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
surplus or revolving fund
 
02:34:27.070 --> 02:34:27.080 align:start position:0%
cities have this applies to all
 
02:34:30.230 --> 02:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities at all levels so this is
 
02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
an enabling for all levels
 
02:34:33.040 --> 02:34:34.309 align:start position:0%
an enabling for all levels
to

02:34:34.309 --> 02:34:34.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:34:36.950 --> 02:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
establish that so
 
02:34:40.389 --> 02:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
may i follow up sir yes thank you um i i
 
02:34:41.510 --> 02:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
think um
 
02:34:43.670 --> 02:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative manjapuri missed my point
 
02:34:45.910 --> 02:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
i may have just made a mistake in in my
 
02:34:48.389 --> 02:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
notes um when i wrote that because as
 
02:34:50.469 --> 02:34:50.479 align:start position:0%
i'm reading it i do think it says that
 
02:34:52.710 --> 02:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
it should not be considered part of
 
02:34:55.190 --> 02:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
any of the counties so that that is my
 
02:34:57.429 --> 02:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
my error um
 
02:35:00.070 --> 02:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
then i'd like to speak to the um
 
02:35:02.630 --> 02:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
to the bill itself um
 
02:35:05.030 --> 02:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
i also had written in here that this was
 
02:35:07.429 --> 02:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
a housekeeping bill as
 
02:35:09.270 --> 02:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
the previous representative had
 
02:35:09.280 --> 02:35:10.230 align:start position:0%
the previous representative had
mentioned

02:35:10.230 --> 02:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:35:13.110 --> 02:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
and that um this is already in existence
 
02:35:16.389 --> 02:35:16.399 align:start position:0%
for towns and this just brought in
 
02:35:18.950 --> 02:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
cities and villages etc am i correct on
 
02:35:20.710 --> 02:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
02:35:24.150 --> 02:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
i can't trust my notes these days
 
02:35:35.110 --> 02:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:37.750 --> 02:35:37.760 align:start position:0%

presently

02:35:42.389 --> 02:35:42.399 align:start position:0%
presently
 
02:35:46.389 --> 02:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
counties do not have revolving funds as
 
02:35:49.190 --> 02:35:49.200 align:start position:0%

02:36:17.349 --> 02:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
clerical errors and i'm concerned
 
02:36:19.190 --> 02:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
that that was pointed out and no
 
02:36:21.349 --> 02:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
amendment has been brought forward to
 
02:36:23.110 --> 02:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
correct those errors
 
02:36:23.120 --> 02:36:25.830 align:start position:0%
correct those errors
so

02:36:25.830 --> 02:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:27.270 align:start position:0%
 
additionally

02:36:27.270 --> 02:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
02:36:29.429 --> 02:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
the comment was made during the hearing
 
02:36:31.429 --> 02:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
that this bill is not ready for prime
 
02:36:31.439 --> 02:36:33.590 align:start position:0%
that this bill is not ready for prime
time

02:36:33.590 --> 02:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:36:37.270 --> 02:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
i would also like to add that rsa 44
 
02:36:39.510 --> 02:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
cities you know already have revolving
 
02:36:41.429 --> 02:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
funds it's already established in
 
02:36:41.439 --> 02:36:42.550 align:start position:0%
funds it's already established in
statute

02:36:42.550 --> 02:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:36:45.590 --> 02:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
this bill adds additional purposes
 
02:36:47.830 --> 02:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
relative to revolving funds
 
02:36:50.710 --> 02:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
rsa 52 village districts
 
02:36:52.469 --> 02:36:52.479 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that section of
 
02:36:55.510 --> 02:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
statute addresses revolving funds for
 
02:36:58.389 --> 02:36:58.399 align:start position:0%
for purposes for village districts and
 
02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
we're just adding more purposes with
 
02:37:01.270 --> 02:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:37:03.110 --> 02:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
and the other comment the last comment
 
02:37:04.389 --> 02:37:04.399 align:start position:0%
that i will make
 
02:37:07.349 --> 02:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
during the hearing as it was stated that
 
02:37:11.190 --> 02:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
counties do not have in general the need
 
02:37:11.200 --> 02:37:12.070 align:start position:0%
counties do not have in general the need
for

02:37:12.070 --> 02:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:37:17.349 --> 02:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:19.590 --> 02:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:21.750 --> 02:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative ron
 
02:37:24.309 --> 02:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
thank you um when this bill came to us
 
02:37:26.309 --> 02:37:26.319 align:start position:0%
for public hearing i
 
02:37:29.030 --> 02:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh got in touch with the town manager of
 
02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:30.309 align:start position:0%
uh got in touch with the town manager of
merrimack

02:37:30.309 --> 02:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
merrimack
 
02:37:30.319 --> 02:37:31.190 align:start position:0%
merrimack
and

02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:37:34.950 --> 02:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
he we use a we have a revolving fund to
 
02:37:38.309 --> 02:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
manage our rec programs where we
 
02:37:40.230 --> 02:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
get receipts in from people that are
 
02:37:42.070 --> 02:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
signing their children up for programs
 
02:37:44.150 --> 02:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
and then those re those receipts are
 
02:37:46.950 --> 02:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
then used for expenses it works very
 
02:37:46.960 --> 02:37:48.950 align:start position:0%
then used for expenses it works very
effectively

02:37:48.950 --> 02:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
02:37:51.349 --> 02:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
i think if there are
 
02:37:53.429 --> 02:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
clerical errors maybe we could put this
 
02:37:55.830 --> 02:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
bill on hold and give
 
02:37:58.150 --> 02:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
time for an amendment to be prepared
 
02:38:00.389 --> 02:38:00.399 align:start position:0%
it's enabling legislation i think it
 
02:38:03.830 --> 02:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
just increases the efficiency of
 
02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
government operations as we've seen in
 
02:38:07.990 --> 02:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
merrimack i really don't think this is a
 
02:38:10.150 --> 02:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
big deal
 
02:38:11.270 --> 02:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
any other
 
02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:14.870 align:start position:0%
any other
inputs

02:38:14.870 --> 02:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
inputs
 
02:38:17.990 --> 02:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
one option we have is to recess the bill
 
02:38:20.870 --> 02:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
and then assign someone to go to ols and
 
02:38:23.910 --> 02:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
get an amendment to fix the
 
02:38:26.389 --> 02:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
issues that we might have with it
 
02:38:41.030 --> 02:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:42.710 --> 02:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
i'm just discussing dates we're looking
 
02:38:44.790 --> 02:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
at the dates to see what uh what we can
 
02:38:47.270 --> 02:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
get done before the cutoff hits
 
02:38:47.280 --> 02:38:49.590 align:start position:0%
get done before the cutoff hits
so

02:38:49.590 --> 02:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:49.600 --> 02:38:50.550 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:38:50.550 --> 02:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:38:52.389 --> 02:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
if someone went today to do it
 
02:38:54.830 --> 02:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's impossible before three
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
o'clock okay it looks like we have a
 
02:38:59.750 --> 02:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
little better than three hours
 
02:39:01.030 --> 02:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
so if
 
02:39:03.990 --> 02:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
if we can get somebody to take
 
02:39:07.429 --> 02:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
a draft of this mark it up with the
 
02:39:09.670 --> 02:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
clerical errors that need to be fixed
 
02:39:11.750 --> 02:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
then it must be noticed
 
02:39:13.429 --> 02:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
before three
 
02:39:14.870 --> 02:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
all right and then it has to be noticed
 
02:39:16.309 --> 02:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
to the clerk
 
02:39:19.030 --> 02:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
before three and then we can put in the
 
02:39:21.510 --> 02:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
calendar we can put it in the calendar
 
02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:22.550 align:start position:0%
calendar we can put it in the calendar
for

02:39:22.550 --> 02:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:39:23.910 --> 02:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
our next uh
 
02:39:26.950 --> 02:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
mr chairman point point of order uh we
 
02:39:29.910 --> 02:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
have two days scheduled
 
02:39:32.070 --> 02:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
two executive session days scheduled for
 
02:39:34.790 --> 02:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
next week could we not take it up then
 
02:39:41.349 --> 02:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:43.110 --> 02:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
no you don't have to notice executive
 
02:39:43.120 --> 02:39:44.070 align:start position:0%
no you don't have to notice executive
sessions

02:39:44.070 --> 02:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
02:39:45.990 --> 02:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
you can do them at any time
 
02:39:47.510 --> 02:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
you are correct we don't have to notice
 
02:39:49.510 --> 02:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
the executive session right i'd be
 
02:39:52.710 --> 02:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
willing to take the markup over to the
 
02:39:55.349 --> 02:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
to ols and get it done if that would be
 
02:39:55.359 --> 02:39:57.429 align:start position:0%
to ols and get it done if that would be
helpful

02:39:57.429 --> 02:39:57.439 align:start position:0%

one else will and that's enough that's
 
02:51:08.070 --> 02:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
two meetings
 
02:51:09.750 --> 02:51:09.760 align:start position:0%

things that is a little more complex
 
02:51:41.590 --> 02:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
than people who believe it
 
02:51:50.309 --> 02:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:50.319 --> 02:51:51.269 align:start position:0%
 
because

02:51:51.269 --> 02:51:51.279 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:51:54.550 --> 02:51:54.560 align:start position:0%

02:51:54.560 --> 02:51:55.910 align:start position:0%

02:52:26.870 --> 02:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
you were so wound up
 
02:52:28.790 --> 02:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's what by the time you wind down
 
02:52:30.790 --> 02:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
it's one o'clock and then i had to get
 
02:52:33.190 --> 02:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
up at between 5 and 5 30.
 
02:52:34.870 --> 02:52:34.880 align:start position:0%

02:52:36.790 --> 02:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
my heart is doing these flip flops and
 
02:52:38.710 --> 02:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
how long
 
02:52:39.750 --> 02:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
not long
 
02:52:47.990 --> 02:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:49.429 --> 02:52:49.439 align:start position:0%
it's not really essential for those in
 
02:52:50.630 --> 02:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
the west
 
02:52:53.110 --> 02:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
or way up yeah
 
02:53:09.269 --> 02:53:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:11.910 --> 02:53:11.920 align:start position:0%

think of it
well

02:53:13.990 --> 02:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:53:15.990 --> 02:53:16.000 align:start position:0%

02:53:18.230 --> 02:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
reviews about it yeah
 
02:53:20.230 --> 02:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
you ever done it no i've never done i'll
 
02:53:26.070 --> 02:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:28.710 --> 02:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
the cardiologist doesn't like it because
 
02:53:31.030 --> 02:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
it's only one
 
02:53:33.110 --> 02:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
you know one
 
02:53:36.150 --> 02:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
input yeah i use this yeah yeah exactly
 
02:53:37.510 --> 02:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
i thought they had the one where you put
 
02:53:39.750 --> 02:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
the two fingers on yeah one at the end
 
02:53:42.309 --> 02:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
yes yeah but it's still
 
02:53:45.429 --> 02:53:45.439 align:start position:0%
considered one input where if they do an
 
02:53:45.439 --> 02:53:47.750 align:start position:0%
considered one input where if they do an
ekg

02:53:47.750 --> 02:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
ekg
 
02:53:49.590 --> 02:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
all over to make sure it's all yeah and
 
02:53:51.349 --> 02:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
then they average and they
 
02:53:54.710 --> 02:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
they look for unusual i mean my oxygen
 
02:53:57.269 --> 02:53:57.279 align:start position:0%
is really up there which is a good thing
 
02:53:59.269 --> 02:53:59.279 align:start position:0%
um but my heart rate is like right now
 
02:53:59.279 --> 02:54:04.309 align:start position:0%
um but my heart rate is like right now
120.

02:54:04.309 --> 02:54:04.319 align:start position:0%

and i can feel those little extra beats
 
02:54:08.230 --> 02:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
going on right now so
 
02:54:11.269 --> 02:54:11.279 align:start position:0%
first understand making me sweat
 
02:54:32.950 --> 02:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:35.349 --> 02:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
64 degrees outside
 
02:54:38.150 --> 02:54:38.160 align:start position:0%

03:43:22.550 --> 03:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
well we were kind of
 
03:43:24.389 --> 03:43:24.399 align:start position:0%
stuck on
 
03:43:27.510 --> 03:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
the discussion about uh
 
03:43:29.990 --> 03:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
how much material would a town like
 
03:43:33.110 --> 03:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
claremont be forced to take
 
03:43:33.120 --> 03:43:34.790 align:start position:0%
claremont be forced to take
and

03:43:34.790 --> 03:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:43:37.990 --> 03:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:41.750 --> 03:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:43.670 --> 03:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
any hole in the legislation that would
 
03:43:46.150 --> 03:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
allow us allow claremont to say no we've
 
03:43:49.030 --> 03:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
had enough or yes we want more
 
03:43:51.429 --> 03:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
or we just don't want your trains coming
 
03:43:55.349 --> 03:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:57.349 --> 03:43:57.359 align:start position:0%

03:44:07.670 --> 03:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:07.680 --> 03:44:10.790 align:start position:0%

and they don't we don't sell the stuff
 
03:45:01.510 --> 03:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
to them but uh we have a contract with
 
03:45:03.670 --> 03:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
them and they lower the contract based
 
03:45:06.550 --> 03:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
on what they get for their tipping fees
 
03:45:10.150 --> 03:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:11.830 --> 03:45:11.840 align:start position:0%

03:45:18.950 --> 03:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative klee and then
 
03:45:20.790 --> 03:45:20.800 align:start position:0%

um
 
03:45:27.189 --> 03:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
i i know that i put a note here that
 
03:45:30.630 --> 03:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
suggests um interim study on it but um
 
03:45:32.710 --> 03:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
if it were ought to pass
 
03:45:35.030 --> 03:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's very it's a one line
 
03:45:35.040 --> 03:45:36.070 align:start position:0%
it's very it's a one line
um

03:45:36.070 --> 03:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:37.750 --> 03:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
one or two lines or one sentence i
 
03:45:38.710 --> 03:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
should say
 
03:45:42.469 --> 03:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:44.870 --> 03:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
based on what representative stavis said
 
03:45:47.910 --> 03:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
about the trains going by
 
03:45:49.910 --> 03:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
and this being enabling
 
03:45:51.429 --> 03:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
i i guess i'm going to ask the question
 
03:45:53.429 --> 03:45:53.439 align:start position:0%
that's already been asked
 
03:45:54.710 --> 03:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
would they be able to yeah but would
 
03:45:56.950 --> 03:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
they be able to
 
03:45:58.630 --> 03:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
create their own
 
03:46:00.070 --> 03:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
edict in other words to be able to say
 
03:46:01.429 --> 03:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
we're only going to take this much and
 
03:46:03.189 --> 03:46:03.199 align:start position:0%
if we get to a certain point we can stop
 
03:46:06.630 --> 03:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
and if they enable it
 
03:46:07.670 --> 03:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
there's nothing
 
03:46:08.870 --> 03:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
in that in the language that would
 
03:46:10.710 --> 03:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
prevent that may i ask representatives
 
03:46:12.550 --> 03:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
davis what her opinion would be on that
 
03:46:16.229 --> 03:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:18.870 --> 03:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
03:46:18.880 --> 03:46:20.229 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
oh

03:46:20.229 --> 03:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:46:21.990 --> 03:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and let me
 
03:46:23.990 --> 03:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
give it a try
 
03:46:24.000 --> 03:46:26.550 align:start position:0%
give it a try
um

03:46:26.550 --> 03:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:30.070 --> 03:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
i think as i said before
 
03:46:32.309 --> 03:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
freight railroads
 
03:46:34.389 --> 03:46:34.399 align:start position:0%
fall under the protection of the federal
 
03:46:34.399 --> 03:46:35.670 align:start position:0%
fall under the protection of the federal
government

03:46:35.670 --> 03:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
government
 
03:46:39.110 --> 03:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
and thus enjoy vast powers
 
03:46:41.990 --> 03:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
that the state has no
 
03:46:44.389 --> 03:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
ability to influence
 
03:46:47.030 --> 03:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
i think you're referring to ferc right
 
03:46:50.389 --> 03:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
is it ferc ferc is that the the
 
03:46:52.469 --> 03:46:52.479 align:start position:0%
governing agency
 
03:46:52.479 --> 03:46:54.550 align:start position:0%
governing agency
no

03:46:54.550 --> 03:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:46:54.560 --> 03:46:55.910 align:start position:0%
no
um

03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:57.110 --> 03:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
it could be
 
03:46:59.990 --> 03:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
no it is not no it's not it's a surface
 
03:47:02.469 --> 03:47:02.479 align:start position:0%
transportation authority
 
03:47:06.150 --> 03:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
i believe um
 
03:47:08.389 --> 03:47:08.399 align:start position:0%
in the city of claremont
 
03:47:10.550 --> 03:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
there was
 
03:47:13.750 --> 03:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
a desire to on the heart of a private
 
03:47:16.790 --> 03:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
rail freight company that enjoys the
 
03:47:18.550 --> 03:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
protection of the federal government
 
03:47:20.229 --> 03:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
because it uses the railroad
 
03:47:20.239 --> 03:47:22.150 align:start position:0%
because it uses the railroad
right-of-way

03:47:22.150 --> 03:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
right-of-way
 
03:47:24.870 --> 03:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
who haul in and out of the city
 
03:47:27.990 --> 03:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
24 hours a day seven days a week
 
03:47:30.309 --> 03:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of tons of
 
03:47:32.550 --> 03:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
construction debris
 
03:47:35.269 --> 03:47:35.279 align:start position:0%
the clermont planning board denied
 
03:47:37.750 --> 03:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
permission for this but it was a long
 
03:47:40.630 --> 03:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
and difficult difficult struggle we had
 
03:47:43.269 --> 03:47:43.279 align:start position:0%
we heard from someone at the hearing
 
03:47:45.670 --> 03:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
from clear clermont testify as to how
 
03:47:48.070 --> 03:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
long and difficult that struggle is
 
03:47:50.469 --> 03:47:50.479 align:start position:0%
my point is
 
03:47:53.590 --> 03:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
the railroads already have as i said
 
03:47:57.030 --> 03:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
before a leg up on the state
 
03:48:01.189 --> 03:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
why do we want to give them another
 
03:48:01.199 --> 03:48:02.469 align:start position:0%
why do we want to give them another
okay

03:48:02.469 --> 03:48:02.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:48:05.030 --> 03:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
let me suggest that uh
 
03:48:07.110 --> 03:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
based on that input we just got that's
 
03:48:09.110 --> 03:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
something to consider when you uh when
 
03:48:10.790 --> 03:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
you record your vote
 
03:48:13.670 --> 03:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
yes uh um i want to kind of add to what
 
03:48:15.750 --> 03:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative stavis had said i can
 
03:48:16.630 --> 03:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
03:48:18.389 --> 03:48:18.399 align:start position:0%
living in nashville we have the freight
 
03:48:21.189 --> 03:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
trains come through we recently had one
 
03:48:22.950 --> 03:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
that stopped for
 
03:48:24.389 --> 03:48:24.399 align:start position:0%
nine hours
 
03:48:27.030 --> 03:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
idling by residential areas and there
 
03:48:29.590 --> 03:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
was nothing we could do about it they
 
03:48:31.349 --> 03:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
felt that it wasn't safe to go forward
 
03:48:32.630 --> 03:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
they don't shut those things off because
 
03:48:34.950 --> 03:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
they're diesel and so on we had no
 
03:48:37.030 --> 03:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
recourse we had no anything and the
 
03:48:38.790 --> 03:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
neighbors had to put up with it so i
 
03:48:40.469 --> 03:48:40.479 align:start position:0%
agree with you they have complete
 
03:48:42.550 --> 03:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
control and we have none so
 
03:48:44.790 --> 03:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
based on that i i completely understand
 
03:48:47.750 --> 03:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative tripp
 
03:48:49.349 --> 03:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:48:49.359 --> 03:48:50.229 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
uh

03:48:50.229 --> 03:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:48:52.469 --> 03:48:52.479 align:start position:0%
the railroad stories are interesting but
 
03:48:55.269 --> 03:48:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh this is about uh
 
03:48:57.590 --> 03:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
transfer stations and what they can
 
03:49:00.870 --> 03:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh accept and and uh how they can
 
03:49:04.229 --> 03:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
get rid of it i i believe the uh
 
03:49:04.239 --> 03:49:05.269 align:start position:0%
get rid of it i i believe the uh
uh

03:49:05.269 --> 03:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:49:07.830 --> 03:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill
 
03:49:11.429 --> 03:49:11.439 align:start position:0%
and i i'm pretty sure that uh uh
 
03:49:13.750 --> 03:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative gilman said that uh
 
03:49:15.830 --> 03:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
they're unable to sell the construction
 
03:49:16.950 --> 03:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
degree they have to go through a
 
03:49:19.429 --> 03:49:19.439 align:start position:0%
middleman and i and i seem to think that
 
03:49:19.439 --> 03:49:20.229 align:start position:0%
middleman and i and i seem to think that
uh

03:49:20.229 --> 03:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:49:22.469 --> 03:49:22.479 align:start position:0%
representatives clea said the same thing
 
03:49:22.479 --> 03:49:23.510 align:start position:0%
representatives clea said the same thing
uh

03:49:23.510 --> 03:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:49:23.520 --> 03:49:24.550 align:start position:0%
uh
so

03:49:24.550 --> 03:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:49:26.070 --> 03:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
it appears
 
03:49:28.309 --> 03:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
that the purpose of this bill
 
03:49:29.269 --> 03:49:29.279 align:start position:0%
is to
 
03:49:31.830 --> 03:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
eliminate the middleman
 
03:49:34.070 --> 03:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
so that uh towns
 
03:49:38.710 --> 03:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:40.229 --> 03:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
put together a contract or whatever
 
03:49:42.070 --> 03:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
would somebody you know maybe the
 
03:49:44.630 --> 03:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
railroad i don't know but uh it it'll
 
03:49:46.790 --> 03:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
eliminate the middleman and allow them
 
03:49:48.229 --> 03:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
to you know
 
03:49:50.950 --> 03:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
get all of their revenue from
 
03:49:52.950 --> 03:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
the construction debris instead of
 
03:49:55.110 --> 03:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
having to share it with the uh
 
03:49:57.030 --> 03:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
the middlemen that are
 
03:49:58.630 --> 03:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
moving off site
 
03:49:59.830 --> 03:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:50:01.670 --> 03:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know if if this isn't what the
 
03:50:03.510 --> 03:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill is then
 
03:50:06.469 --> 03:50:06.479 align:start position:0%
you know could you please inform me okay
 
03:50:06.479 --> 03:50:07.510 align:start position:0%
you know could you please inform me okay
um

03:50:07.510 --> 03:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:10.389 --> 03:50:10.399 align:start position:0%
representative majori
 
03:50:12.150 --> 03:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i just want to
 
03:50:12.160 --> 03:50:12.950 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i just want to
state

03:50:12.950 --> 03:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:50:14.389 --> 03:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
i agree the conversation about the
 
03:50:17.189 --> 03:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
railroad is interesting and if we do
 
03:50:19.429 --> 03:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
if we do uh have a different vote to go
 
03:50:20.710 --> 03:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
to interim study i think that would be
 
03:50:22.950 --> 03:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
interesting however that said
 
03:50:25.269 --> 03:50:25.279 align:start position:0%
the bill was moved ought to pass
 
03:50:26.469 --> 03:50:26.479 align:start position:0%
we certainly don't think that the
 
03:50:28.070 --> 03:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor is going to object to an ought
 
03:50:30.710 --> 03:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
to pass motion uh we may have to revisit
 
03:50:32.630 --> 03:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
the bill it may have to be updated there
 
03:50:34.710 --> 03:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
may have to be some changes
 
03:50:36.229 --> 03:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
but if the feeling of this committee is
 
03:50:38.469 --> 03:50:38.479 align:start position:0%
ought to pass i would bet dimes to
 
03:50:40.150 --> 03:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
dollars that we're not going to get an
 
03:50:43.110 --> 03:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
objection from the sponsor so i i i'm
 
03:50:44.550 --> 03:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
sorry if i've thrown a wrench into the
 
03:50:45.750 --> 03:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
works a little bit and wanted to pass
 
03:50:47.590 --> 03:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
that along thank you
 
03:50:49.429 --> 03:50:49.439 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
03:50:51.269 --> 03:50:51.279 align:start position:0%
and i don't see we don't have any
 
03:50:51.279 --> 03:50:52.469 align:start position:0%
and i don't see we don't have any
amendments

03:50:52.469 --> 03:50:52.479 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
03:50:53.910 --> 03:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
ending for this
 
03:50:57.030 --> 03:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
so this is not to pass by itself yes
 
03:50:58.870 --> 03:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative gilman
 
03:51:00.950 --> 03:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair one of the questions
 
03:51:03.510 --> 03:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
that we had i think that is not
 
03:51:05.590 --> 03:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
currently in the waste
 
03:51:09.189 --> 03:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
management rsas is that
 
03:51:12.150 --> 03:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
the line line four of the debris comes
 
03:51:12.160 --> 03:51:13.269 align:start position:0%
the line line four of the debris comes
from

03:51:13.269 --> 03:51:13.279 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:51:15.510 --> 03:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
a project being completed in town or
 
03:51:17.510 --> 03:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
from a general contracting business
 
03:51:19.910 --> 03:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
based in town
 
03:51:21.750 --> 03:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to give an example of
 
03:51:23.830 --> 03:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
what exeter went through
 
03:51:26.550 --> 03:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
we have a dump
 
03:51:28.950 --> 03:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
stump dump and brush dump and they were
 
03:51:31.030 --> 03:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
getting filled up by contractors who
 
03:51:31.040 --> 03:51:31.910 align:start position:0%
getting filled up by contractors who
knew

03:51:31.910 --> 03:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
knew
 
03:51:34.150 --> 03:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh they only had to pay five bucks for a
 
03:51:37.189 --> 03:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh with an exeter registered car but
 
03:51:38.710 --> 03:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
they could do all their business in
 
03:51:40.150 --> 03:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
kensington and
 
03:51:41.750 --> 03:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
stratum and elsewhere and we were
 
03:51:44.150 --> 03:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
getting all of their brush and stumps
 
03:51:46.070 --> 03:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
until we couldn't move them anymore we
 
03:51:47.670 --> 03:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't uh we couldn't handle it
 
03:51:47.680 --> 03:51:48.630 align:start position:0%
couldn't uh we couldn't handle it
anymore

03:51:48.630 --> 03:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
03:51:50.309 --> 03:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
and we
 
03:51:53.910 --> 03:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
ended up giving uh having licenses so a
 
03:51:56.150 --> 03:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
business has to prove that you say
 
03:51:56.160 --> 03:52:00.070 align:start position:0%
business has to prove that you say
licenses

03:52:00.070 --> 03:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:02.950 --> 03:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
well not was a license actually um
 
03:52:05.110 --> 03:52:05.120 align:start position:0%
so the person whose refuse is being
 
03:52:07.349 --> 03:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
taken away has to sign it that they live
 
03:52:09.429 --> 03:52:09.439 align:start position:0%
in exeter and then the person who owns
 
03:52:11.670 --> 03:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
the business has to sign it that they
 
03:52:14.150 --> 03:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
their business is in exeter so that
 
03:52:16.870 --> 03:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's really controlled the amount of
 
03:52:19.830 --> 03:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh stuff that's been put in our dump
 
03:52:21.429 --> 03:52:21.439 align:start position:0%
that's that's what they call local
 
03:52:23.750 --> 03:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
controlling yeah i think so
 
03:52:26.389 --> 03:52:26.399 align:start position:0%
yes representative tripp
 
03:52:28.070 --> 03:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
03:52:31.990 --> 03:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:34.630 --> 03:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
you can agree with me
 
03:52:36.950 --> 03:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i just wanted to add
 
03:52:38.710 --> 03:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
about the tippage
 
03:52:41.189 --> 03:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
fee that the municipalities get like
 
03:52:42.950 --> 03:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
nashua gets at the bridge feeds
 
03:52:46.950 --> 03:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
typically uh 80 dollars a ton right now
 
03:52:50.229 --> 03:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
but they limit outside construction
 
03:52:53.030 --> 03:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
material to come to the dump or for
 
03:52:55.910 --> 03:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
recycling and you know and we also have
 
03:52:57.590 --> 03:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
the recycling stream
 
03:53:00.150 --> 03:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
so there's a different and we had a swap
 
03:53:02.309 --> 03:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
shop that was not you couldn't resell
 
03:53:05.269 --> 03:53:05.279 align:start position:0%
but repurpose or reuse that was you know
 
03:53:05.279 --> 03:53:06.150 align:start position:0%
but repurpose or reuse that was you know
very

03:53:06.150 --> 03:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
very
 
03:53:09.429 --> 03:53:09.439 align:start position:0%
um it stopped so there's also the cost
 
03:53:12.469 --> 03:53:12.479 align:start position:0%
that you know tippage can go up
 
03:53:15.510 --> 03:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
there people especially the construction
 
03:53:17.910 --> 03:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
debris is a big uh
 
03:53:20.550 --> 03:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
issue in terms of trying to get rid of
 
03:53:22.710 --> 03:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
so they might be willing to
 
03:53:25.189 --> 03:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
increase the tippage free
 
03:53:27.349 --> 03:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of a community that weighs
 
03:53:27.359 --> 03:53:28.790 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of a community that weighs
everything

03:53:28.790 --> 03:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
everything
 
03:53:36.150 --> 03:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:38.870 --> 03:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative power thank you mr
 
03:53:42.229 --> 03:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
chair as i recall before the lunch break
 
03:53:44.870 --> 03:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
pertaining to this bill there was
 
03:53:46.550 --> 03:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
it was made
 
03:53:48.229 --> 03:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned
 
03:53:51.830 --> 03:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
that um there was a commission to study
 
03:53:53.189 --> 03:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
03:53:56.070 --> 03:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
and something about gel car rules
 
03:53:58.870 --> 03:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
so if this bill were to go to an interim
 
03:54:01.269 --> 03:54:01.279 align:start position:0%
study how would that work in a second
 
03:54:01.279 --> 03:54:02.309 align:start position:0%
study how would that work in a second
year

03:54:02.309 --> 03:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:54:03.750 --> 03:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
in year two
 
03:54:05.990 --> 03:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
what is the timetable can whoever
 
03:54:07.349 --> 03:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
brought that up
 
03:54:08.950 --> 03:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
can you uh
 
03:54:11.189 --> 03:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
talk to it again and and give us some
 
03:54:14.469 --> 03:54:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:17.030 --> 03:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair and uh and i
 
03:54:18.550 --> 03:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate that question and i
 
03:54:21.030 --> 03:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
wish i had a specific answer to it
 
03:54:23.189 --> 03:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
um and i can try to get that now in fact
 
03:54:25.189 --> 03:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
i did just email the sponsor a second
 
03:54:27.349 --> 03:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
ago to see if he had any extra input on
 
03:54:29.429 --> 03:54:29.439 align:start position:0%
this i only know that those rules are
 
03:54:32.389 --> 03:54:32.399 align:start position:0%
coming and or are working through
 
03:54:35.429 --> 03:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
the process that they have right now
 
03:54:37.590 --> 03:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
how that process then affects what would
 
03:54:39.750 --> 03:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
happen in interim study i i can't answer
 
03:54:42.469 --> 03:54:42.479 align:start position:0%
that specifically except to say
 
03:54:44.870 --> 03:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
we may have we may get the exact same
 
03:54:48.389 --> 03:54:48.399 align:start position:0%
bill or we may get a bill that you know
 
03:54:50.950 --> 03:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
is is improved we may this may go in the
 
03:54:52.710 --> 03:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
trash i think it could go any one of
 
03:54:54.950 --> 03:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
those three routes routes depending on
 
03:54:56.550 --> 03:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
what happens through that process which
 
03:54:57.349 --> 03:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
is why
 
03:54:58.870 --> 03:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
i don't think the ought to pass would be
 
03:55:00.950 --> 03:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
a terrible thing in any way that would
 
03:55:03.269 --> 03:55:03.279 align:start position:0%
be odd that i'm fighting against it um
 
03:55:05.269 --> 03:55:05.279 align:start position:0%
but i i don't have a specific answer to
 
03:55:07.590 --> 03:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
your question follow-up mr chair
 
03:55:07.600 --> 03:55:08.389 align:start position:0%
your question follow-up mr chair
yes

03:55:08.389 --> 03:55:08.399 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:55:10.229 --> 03:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
yes i agree with all that the
 
03:55:13.670 --> 03:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative stated my question and my
 
03:55:15.510 --> 03:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
concern is is
 
03:55:18.150 --> 03:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
if this bill went to an interim study
 
03:55:20.469 --> 03:55:20.479 align:start position:0%
what is the timeline for the interim
 
03:55:22.790 --> 03:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
study in year two
 
03:55:25.750 --> 03:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
of a biennium
 
03:55:25.760 --> 03:55:27.670 align:start position:0%
of a biennium
because

03:55:27.670 --> 03:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:55:29.510 --> 03:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
i just don't understand as a freshman
 
03:55:37.510 --> 03:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:39.590 --> 03:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not exactly sure
 
03:55:40.870 --> 03:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
if anything
 
03:55:42.389 --> 03:55:42.399 align:start position:0%
november yes
 
03:55:44.710 --> 03:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
we're thinking it's november but i don't
 
03:55:46.229 --> 03:55:46.239 align:start position:0%
know for sure we have a commission that
 
03:55:47.830 --> 03:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
ends in november that's why yes
 
03:55:49.750 --> 03:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative platt yes just for
 
03:55:49.760 --> 03:55:51.189 align:start position:0%
representative platt yes just for
edification

03:55:51.189 --> 03:55:51.199 align:start position:0%
edification
 
03:55:53.189 --> 03:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
federal energy regulatory commission is
 
03:55:56.070 --> 03:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
ferc and so it's gas pipelines it's
 
03:55:58.469 --> 03:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
electric transmission it's uh the
 
03:55:59.990 --> 03:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
03:56:02.950 --> 03:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
independent system operators uh and uh
 
03:56:05.110 --> 03:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
indirectly generation by control of the
 
03:56:07.510 --> 03:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
market but not directly generation so
 
03:56:09.030 --> 03:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
it's got nothing to do with railroads
 
03:56:11.910 --> 03:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
that service transportation board
 
03:56:14.309 --> 03:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
but i have a question of representative
 
03:56:14.319 --> 03:56:16.630 align:start position:0%
but i have a question of representative
stavis

03:56:16.630 --> 03:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
stavis
 
03:56:19.590 --> 03:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
if if this is enabling legislation it's
 
03:56:20.950 --> 03:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
not forcing
 
03:56:23.110 --> 03:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
any any municipality to do anything they
 
03:56:24.790 --> 03:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
could still say no how does that give a
 
03:56:27.189 --> 03:56:27.199 align:start position:0%
railroad a leg up
 
03:56:30.309 --> 03:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh i i would imagine i'll let
 
03:56:31.990 --> 03:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative davis speak for herself
 
03:56:33.830 --> 03:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
but i imagine that you're
 
03:56:33.840 --> 03:56:35.590 align:start position:0%
but i imagine that you're
probably

03:56:35.590 --> 03:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
probably
 
03:56:36.950 --> 03:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
trying to navigate through a bunch of
 
03:56:39.910 --> 03:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:42.630 --> 03:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
federal organizations
 
03:56:42.640 --> 03:56:43.670 align:start position:0%
federal organizations
correct

03:56:43.670 --> 03:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:56:46.309 --> 03:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
and it and it doesn't really give them a
 
03:56:48.950 --> 03:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
green light it's just yet another way of
 
03:56:51.189 --> 03:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
making it easier
 
03:56:54.309 --> 03:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:56:56.790 --> 03:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not pretending that that
 
03:56:59.429 --> 03:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
this enabling legislation is going to
 
03:57:01.510 --> 03:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
stop a railroad because that's just
 
03:57:03.189 --> 03:57:03.199 align:start position:0%
never going to happen
 
03:57:03.199 --> 03:57:04.550 align:start position:0%
never going to happen
but

03:57:04.550 --> 03:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:57:07.510 --> 03:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
in my view and in my experience
 
03:57:11.590 --> 03:57:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:13.590 --> 03:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
they've got all the permission they need
 
03:57:16.870 --> 03:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
and we don't need to give them more
 
03:57:18.150 --> 03:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
i hope that answers your question
 
03:57:20.710 --> 03:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
representative representative majipudi
 
03:57:22.630 --> 03:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair
 
03:57:26.070 --> 03:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
just um you know knowing that to answers
 
03:57:27.830 --> 03:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh one of your questions uh
 
03:57:30.229 --> 03:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
representative powers is there's a
 
03:57:32.309 --> 03:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
commission already established which is
 
03:57:35.349 --> 03:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
working with def on addressing this
 
03:57:37.349 --> 03:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
particular issue about the uh solid
 
03:57:37.359 --> 03:57:38.229 align:start position:0%
particular issue about the uh solid
waste

03:57:38.229 --> 03:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
waste
 
03:57:41.670 --> 03:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
management in the state so we are this
 
03:57:43.429 --> 03:57:43.439 align:start position:0%
bill is in the going in the right
 
03:57:45.189 --> 03:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
direction so it won't
 
03:57:48.469 --> 03:57:48.479 align:start position:0%
whether it is octopass or interim study
 
03:57:51.269 --> 03:57:51.279 align:start position:0%
it will uh coincide with what they're
 
03:57:53.269 --> 03:57:53.279 align:start position:0%
looking at what we got from
 
03:57:55.189 --> 03:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
representative evil who chairs that
 
03:57:57.349 --> 03:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
commission is that
 
03:57:59.990 --> 03:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know you don't have to go through uh
 
03:58:02.870 --> 03:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
dotting uh every eye and crossing every
 
03:58:06.070 --> 03:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
t with this bill we are already getting
 
03:58:08.790 --> 03:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
there in a few weeks we'll get the
 
03:58:10.790 --> 03:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations so
 
03:58:12.790 --> 03:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
and again like
 
03:58:14.870 --> 03:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
our colleague my colleague
 
03:58:16.790 --> 03:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
representative maggiore
 
03:58:17.670 --> 03:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:58:19.590 --> 03:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
interim study or otp it's not going to
 
03:58:21.349 --> 03:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
hurt we are moving in the right
 
03:58:25.349 --> 03:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:25.359 --> 03:58:26.950 align:start position:0%
 
the

03:58:26.950 --> 03:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:58:29.110 --> 03:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
question on the table is do you want to
 
03:58:29.120 --> 03:58:31.590 align:start position:0%
question on the table is do you want to
otp

03:58:31.590 --> 03:58:31.600 align:start position:0%

that's the question
 
03:58:41.189 --> 03:58:41.199 align:start position:0%
i see no objection why don't we call the
 
03:58:41.199 --> 03:58:51.030 align:start position:0%

the session on
 
04:01:50.309 --> 04:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
house bill 1194 which is a relative
 
04:01:53.349 --> 04:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
procedure for overriding a local tax cap
 
04:01:55.189 --> 04:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
04:01:56.950 --> 04:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
mis thank you mr chair i'd like to make
 
04:01:58.830 --> 04:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
a motion on house bill
 
04:02:02.150 --> 04:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
1194 i'd like to motion ought to pass
 
04:02:05.990 --> 04:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:06.000 --> 04:02:08.229 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:02:08.229 --> 04:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:02:10.550 --> 04:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
seconds it
 
04:02:13.030 --> 04:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
04:02:15.590 --> 04:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair the this bill is
 
04:02:17.189 --> 04:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
an important bill
 
04:02:22.150 --> 04:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
because we we've heard a lot about
 
04:02:24.389 --> 04:02:24.399 align:start position:0%
unsustainable spending at the local
 
04:02:29.229 --> 04:02:29.239 align:start position:0%
level with regard to um
 
04:02:31.990 --> 04:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities as well as school
 
04:02:32.000 --> 04:02:33.030 align:start position:0%
municipalities as well as school
districts

04:02:33.030 --> 04:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
districts
 
04:02:35.189 --> 04:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
so this
 
04:02:39.030 --> 04:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:42.469 --> 04:02:42.479 align:start position:0%
tax caps are enabling legislation
 
04:02:42.479 --> 04:02:45.349 align:start position:0%
tax caps are enabling legislation
and

04:02:45.349 --> 04:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:49.189 --> 04:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
a tax cap can be adopted by a super
 
04:02:49.199 --> 04:02:50.630 align:start position:0%
a tax cap can be adopted by a super
majority

04:02:50.630 --> 04:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
majority
 
04:02:53.349 --> 04:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
and the way that the law is right now is
 
04:02:57.110 --> 04:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
that that tax cap can be over ridden
 
04:02:59.349 --> 04:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
by a simple majority
 
04:03:02.229 --> 04:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
and in my opinion there's really no
 
04:03:04.870 --> 04:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
teeth in that type of a tax cap
 
04:03:07.590 --> 04:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
so by changing the
 
04:03:07.600 --> 04:03:08.550 align:start position:0%
so by changing the
vote

04:03:08.550 --> 04:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
provision to override a tax cap
 
04:03:13.990 --> 04:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
requiring a super majority
 
04:03:16.389 --> 04:03:16.399 align:start position:0%
puts teeth into the tax cap
 
04:03:18.790 --> 04:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
and it also
 
04:03:18.800 --> 04:03:20.229 align:start position:0%
and it also
encourages

04:03:20.229 --> 04:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
encourages
 
04:03:22.550 --> 04:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal responsibility
 
04:03:24.630 --> 04:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
in that
 
04:03:27.830 --> 04:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
a super majority has to
 
04:03:30.870 --> 04:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
vote and agree to override the tax cap
 
04:03:33.990 --> 04:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
rather than a simple majority
 
04:03:38.229 --> 04:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
and also i might point out that by
 
04:03:39.910 --> 04:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
changing the
 
04:03:39.920 --> 04:03:41.189 align:start position:0%
changing the
override

04:03:41.189 --> 04:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
override
 
04:03:44.389 --> 04:03:44.399 align:start position:0%
to three-fifths super majority it it
 
04:03:46.469 --> 04:03:46.479 align:start position:0%
it mirrors the
 
04:03:52.229 --> 04:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:54.469 --> 04:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
there additional discussion
 
04:04:00.550 --> 04:04:00.560 align:start position:0%

04:06:45.990 --> 04:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
do we have a uh
 
04:06:50.630 --> 04:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:58.630 --> 04:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:01.670 --> 04:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
04:07:05.590 --> 04:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:05.600 --> 04:07:09.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:07:09.750 --> 04:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:11.510 --> 04:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher do you have an
 
04:07:11.520 --> 04:07:13.110 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher do you have an
input

04:07:13.110 --> 04:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
input
 
04:07:13.120 --> 04:07:14.309 align:start position:0%
input
um

04:07:14.309 --> 04:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:14.319 --> 04:07:15.110 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:07:15.110 --> 04:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:07:17.750 --> 04:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
well i'd just like to
 
04:07:20.830 --> 04:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
update the committee about
 
04:07:22.790 --> 04:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
um where
 
04:07:25.910 --> 04:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
or what the current status of
 
04:07:28.229 --> 04:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
the bill is in terms of
 
04:07:30.150 --> 04:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
what i've been talking with people about
 
04:07:30.160 --> 04:07:31.030 align:start position:0%
what i've been talking with people about
um

04:07:31.030 --> 04:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:31.040 --> 04:07:31.910 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:07:31.910 --> 04:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:07:34.630 --> 04:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
the municipal association
 
04:07:34.640 --> 04:07:35.670 align:start position:0%
the municipal association
um

04:07:35.670 --> 04:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:39.429 --> 04:07:39.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there was another bill
 
04:07:42.790 --> 04:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
um house bill 1021
 
04:07:45.030 --> 04:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
that passed out of judiciary and might
 
04:07:45.040 --> 04:07:46.309 align:start position:0%
that passed out of judiciary and might
cover

04:07:46.309 --> 04:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
cover
 
04:07:48.870 --> 04:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
the same cases i was carrying
 
04:07:50.790 --> 04:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
i was carrying about here
 
04:07:52.870 --> 04:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
with 12 19.
 
04:07:55.349 --> 04:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
um so i emailed the sponsors of that
 
04:07:57.750 --> 04:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
bill and the members of the judiciary
 
04:07:59.429 --> 04:07:59.439 align:start position:0%
committee and
 
04:08:01.750 --> 04:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
the person i heard back from joe
 
04:08:04.389 --> 04:08:04.399 align:start position:0%
alexander at first seemed to say that
 
04:08:06.229 --> 04:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
yes it would cover
 
04:08:07.910 --> 04:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
the cases i don't care about here but
 
04:08:09.429 --> 04:08:09.439 align:start position:0%
then on
 
04:08:09.439 --> 04:08:10.790 align:start position:0%
then on
um

04:08:10.790 --> 04:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:13.189 --> 04:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
further questioning uh he seemed to
 
04:08:15.510 --> 04:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
change his mind and say no it
 
04:08:18.630 --> 04:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually cover the cases so
 
04:08:20.630 --> 04:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
since there's still
 
04:08:20.640 --> 04:08:22.149 align:start position:0%
since there's still
some

04:08:22.149 --> 04:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:08:23.990 --> 04:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
confusion about how this might interact
 
04:08:25.990 --> 04:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
with other laws um
 
04:08:27.750 --> 04:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:08:29.590 --> 04:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
well what i'd want to do with it would
 
04:08:30.950 --> 04:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
be to
 
04:08:33.910 --> 04:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
move this one to interim study too
 
04:08:36.550 --> 04:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
so we can get some answers to how this
 
04:08:36.560 --> 04:08:37.510 align:start position:0%
so we can get some answers to how this
might

04:08:37.510 --> 04:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
might
 
04:08:41.349 --> 04:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
interact with other legislation and
 
04:08:43.189 --> 04:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
clarify some of the other things that
 
04:08:45.670 --> 04:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
people had questions about
 
04:08:47.510 --> 04:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay we have a motion on the floor so
 
04:08:49.670 --> 04:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
we'll have to wait to disposition that
 
04:08:49.680 --> 04:08:50.550 align:start position:0%
we'll have to wait to disposition that
one

04:08:50.550 --> 04:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:08:53.670 --> 04:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
first excuse me and then we can look at
 
04:08:56.550 --> 04:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:58.469 --> 04:08:58.479 align:start position:0%
i checked and
 
04:08:59.670 --> 04:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
04:09:02.550 --> 04:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
have an uh an overriding
 
04:09:05.510 --> 04:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh mo there is no overriding motion
 
04:09:07.830 --> 04:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
like it like there is in the house
 
04:09:09.670 --> 04:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
where where a
 
04:09:12.389 --> 04:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
motion to table or
 
04:09:15.189 --> 04:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
whatever is uh rises to the top and you
 
04:09:16.870 --> 04:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
have to jump in so
 
04:09:19.750 --> 04:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
um i was
 
04:09:19.760 --> 04:09:22.790 align:start position:0%
um i was
educated

04:09:22.790 --> 04:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:24.149 --> 04:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
so we're going to take the motions in
 
04:09:26.550 --> 04:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
order yes we have a
 
04:09:28.550 --> 04:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
comment or
 
04:09:30.309 --> 04:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
a quick comment yes thank you mr chair
 
04:09:33.110 --> 04:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
just looking at at 10 21 which i've read
 
04:09:34.950 --> 04:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative alexander it was good
 
04:09:36.630 --> 04:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
that he responded but there are three
 
04:09:38.070 --> 04:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
sponsors on that bill that we hadn't
 
04:09:41.349 --> 04:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
heard back from yet a 1021 passed out
 
04:09:43.750 --> 04:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
with a 14 to 7
 
04:09:46.710 --> 04:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
vote i i just really i think that
 
04:09:48.550 --> 04:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
there might be a good opportunity here
 
04:09:50.149 --> 04:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
to see where we could
 
04:09:52.149 --> 04:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
fold legislation together see how it
 
04:09:54.149 --> 04:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
dovetails and works together rather than
 
04:09:54.159 --> 04:09:55.110 align:start position:0%
dovetails and works together rather than
having

04:09:55.110 --> 04:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
having
 
04:09:56.790 --> 04:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
different legislation trying to
 
04:09:59.269 --> 04:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
accomplish the same goals
 
04:10:02.149 --> 04:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
so i would uh i'll be voting against the
 
04:10:02.159 --> 04:10:03.670 align:start position:0%
so i would uh i'll be voting against the
ipl

04:10:03.670 --> 04:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
ipl
 
04:10:09.990 --> 04:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:12.229 --> 04:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
that's an older bill 12 19.
 
04:10:18.229 --> 04:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:20.149 --> 04:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
judiciary has it sorry
 
04:10:20.159 --> 04:10:22.389 align:start position:0%
judiciary has it sorry
okay

04:10:22.389 --> 04:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:10:24.550 --> 04:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
all right if we get any input does
 
04:10:25.910 --> 04:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
anybody have any input back from
 
04:10:28.309 --> 04:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
judiciary of of uh
 
04:10:33.269 --> 04:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:34.950 --> 04:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
i believe that's what
 
04:10:37.189 --> 04:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
i believe that's what uh representative
 
04:10:38.950 --> 04:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
gallagher said that he heard back from
 
04:10:40.710 --> 04:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
one of the four
 
04:10:40.720 --> 04:10:42.229 align:start position:0%
one of the four
sponsors

04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
sponsors
 
04:10:45.349 --> 04:10:45.359 align:start position:0%
of 10 21. and they changed his mind
 
04:10:47.189 --> 04:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
um to to be clear i don't think that
 
04:10:49.189 --> 04:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative alexander was actually
 
04:10:50.550 --> 04:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
one of the sponsors i thought he was
 
04:10:53.349 --> 04:10:53.359 align:start position:0%
just a member of the judiciary committee
 
04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
he is a he is a co-sponsor oh okay never
 
04:11:00.229 --> 04:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:09.510 --> 04:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:12.229 --> 04:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
okay 12 19 is ours so we have a motion
 
04:11:14.950 --> 04:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:18.950 --> 04:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:22.870 --> 04:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
yes miss representative um
 
04:11:25.349 --> 04:11:25.359 align:start position:0%
i i have a lot of questions about this
 
04:11:27.030 --> 04:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
bill in general
 
04:11:27.040 --> 04:11:28.229 align:start position:0%
bill in general
um

04:11:28.229 --> 04:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:30.229 --> 04:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
well i i think it's got good intent
 
04:11:31.990 --> 04:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
which is why i would like to see it also
 
04:11:35.830 --> 04:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
go to interim study my biggest concern
 
04:11:37.429 --> 04:11:37.439 align:start position:0%
was something that got brought up i had
 
04:11:39.590 --> 04:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
not thought about it was the tax
 
04:11:42.870 --> 04:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
implications for housing of um
 
04:11:44.950 --> 04:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
of religious
 
04:11:46.229 --> 04:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
what i don't want to call religious
 
04:11:47.990 --> 04:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
housing but housing on religious
 
04:11:50.790 --> 04:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
property how that tax implication would
 
04:11:53.030 --> 04:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh would work out which is why i think
 
04:11:54.950 --> 04:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
an interim study rather than just trying
 
04:11:56.070 --> 04:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
to kill this
 
04:11:58.389 --> 04:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
might not be a bad uh are you concerned
 
04:11:58.399 --> 04:12:00.149 align:start position:0%
might not be a bad uh are you concerned
that

04:12:00.149 --> 04:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:12:01.750 --> 04:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
this could take
 
04:12:03.990 --> 04:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
non-taxable property and move it over to
 
04:12:05.349 --> 04:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
being taxable
 
04:12:07.990 --> 04:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
or or that non-taxable property
 
04:12:12.149 --> 04:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
being used for the purpose of revenue
 
04:12:15.110 --> 04:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
could then not be taxed and
 
04:12:16.630 --> 04:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
versus if the same housing were put
 
04:12:17.910 --> 04:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
04:12:19.429 --> 04:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
um that i guess
 
04:12:21.269 --> 04:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
but that's the question is would it or
 
04:12:23.590 --> 04:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it and i i think to give it a
 
04:12:25.830 --> 04:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
fair shot interim study might not be a
 
04:12:28.149 --> 04:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
bad idea but just my thoughts thank you
 
04:12:32.309 --> 04:12:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:32.319 --> 04:12:33.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:12:33.910 --> 04:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:12:35.910 --> 04:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
you raising your hand
 
04:12:37.590 --> 04:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
we have a motion on the floor in a
 
04:12:37.600 --> 04:12:38.710 align:start position:0%
we have a motion on the floor in a
second

04:12:38.710 --> 04:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:12:38.720 --> 04:12:40.389 align:start position:0%
second

04:12:53.269 --> 04:12:53.279 align:start position:0%

if

04:14:55.030 --> 04:14:55.040 align:start position:0%

04:15:16.830 --> 04:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
04:15:21.670 --> 04:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
next is house bill 1223
 
04:15:23.830 --> 04:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
which is relative to meeting attendance
 
04:15:25.750 --> 04:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
requirements for elected members of the
 
04:15:29.349 --> 04:15:29.359 align:start position:0%
budget committee and school board
 
04:15:32.469 --> 04:15:32.479 align:start position:0%
yes representative wrong i move that we
 
04:15:38.790 --> 04:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:44.469 --> 04:15:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:54.550 --> 04:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:57.189 --> 04:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
okay is the discussion on the
 
04:15:59.269 --> 04:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
on the motion to itl
 
04:16:01.510 --> 04:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative wrong
 
04:16:03.189 --> 04:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
yeah there's there's two things that
 
04:16:05.110 --> 04:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
jump out on me on this one is the
 
04:16:08.790 --> 04:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
definition of extenuating circumstances
 
04:16:10.790 --> 04:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
um i would be more comfortable if there
 
04:16:13.110 --> 04:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
were specific instances like illness
 
04:16:15.189 --> 04:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
hospitalization death in the family
 
04:16:16.389 --> 04:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
04:16:19.030 --> 04:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
this leaves it up to the um
 
04:16:20.550 --> 04:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
just the pleasure of the chair or the
 
04:16:22.870 --> 04:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
other budget committee members
 
04:16:24.550 --> 04:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
and the other thing
 
04:16:26.790 --> 04:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
i i have trouble with with this bill it
 
04:16:29.590 --> 04:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
says any member of an elected elected
 
04:16:31.910 --> 04:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
budget committee who fails to attend two
 
04:16:34.389 --> 04:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
or more scheduled and noticed meetings
 
04:16:37.269 --> 04:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
or 25 of such meetings annually
 
04:16:38.950 --> 04:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
shall be considered to have created a
 
04:16:42.149 --> 04:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
vacancy in the elected position
 
04:16:44.389 --> 04:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
i think it was representative tripp had
 
04:16:46.229 --> 04:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
raised this issue before
 
04:16:49.429 --> 04:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
i mean to miss two meetings i mean
 
04:16:50.950 --> 04:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
we've had people on this committee that
 
04:16:53.349 --> 04:16:53.359 align:start position:0%
have missed two meetings for
 
04:16:55.670 --> 04:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
illness or hospitalization
 
04:16:58.229 --> 04:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
but here there's no definition there's
 
04:17:00.469 --> 04:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
no excused or accepted
 
04:17:02.630 --> 04:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
i mean look how many members we've had
 
04:17:05.830 --> 04:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
that have missed house sessions and
 
04:17:07.750 --> 04:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
they're not kicked out of their
 
04:17:10.469 --> 04:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
elected positions because of that so i
 
04:17:12.790 --> 04:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
think this this goes
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
way overboard in ignoring the wishes of
 
04:17:17.269 --> 04:17:17.279 align:start position:0%
the voters i think we need to really
 
04:17:19.510 --> 04:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
protect the voters wish to have their
 
04:17:19.520 --> 04:17:21.269 align:start position:0%
protect the voters wish to have their
representation

04:17:21.269 --> 04:17:21.279 align:start position:0%
representation
 
04:17:24.229 --> 04:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
and not have that removed from them
 
04:17:26.710 --> 04:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
because of only having two absences
 
04:17:28.229 --> 04:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
thank you we have an additional
 
04:17:31.030 --> 04:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
discussion yes representative please
 
04:17:33.910 --> 04:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i agree with
 
04:17:36.070 --> 04:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
representative wrong and all that she
 
04:17:36.080 --> 04:17:37.110 align:start position:0%
representative wrong and all that she
said

04:17:37.110 --> 04:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:17:39.349 --> 04:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
i couldn't help but think about this as
 
04:17:41.349 --> 04:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
i read it when it talked about that it
 
04:17:42.950 --> 04:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
would create an automatic vacancy
 
04:17:45.110 --> 04:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
meaning that the person is removed
 
04:17:48.070 --> 04:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
is that not kind of an end run to a
 
04:17:50.630 --> 04:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
pseudo recall you're basically taking
 
04:17:53.110 --> 04:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
them out of an elected position and one
 
04:17:55.030 --> 04:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
of the nice things about new hampshire
 
04:17:56.950 --> 04:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
is we don't do that
 
04:17:58.870 --> 04:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
that's what kind of concerned me about
 
04:17:58.880 --> 04:18:00.550 align:start position:0%
that's what kind of concerned me about
this

04:18:00.550 --> 04:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:18:03.429 --> 04:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
i know in the city of nashua we
 
04:18:05.750 --> 04:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
the aldermen if you miss three in a
 
04:18:07.990 --> 04:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
quarter um you're not entitled to your
 
04:18:11.030 --> 04:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
stipend unless the entire body votes on
 
04:18:14.309 --> 04:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
it to grant that exception and so on so
 
04:18:17.030 --> 04:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
i i think that this is
 
04:18:18.790 --> 04:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
literally removing someone from their
 
04:18:21.349 --> 04:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
position that the body had elected and
 
04:18:21.359 --> 04:18:22.309 align:start position:0%
position that the body had elected and
um

04:18:22.309 --> 04:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:24.630 --> 04:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
that does concern me some i think it's a
 
04:18:26.389 --> 04:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
slippery slope if we vote for this so
 
04:18:28.790 --> 04:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you just a point of
 
04:18:31.429 --> 04:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
information my and my town
 
04:18:33.110 --> 04:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
04:18:38.309 --> 04:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
a provision to remove a counselor
 
04:18:40.870 --> 04:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
and it can be for whatever the council
 
04:18:42.550 --> 04:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
wants it to be it can be for bad
 
04:18:44.550 --> 04:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
attendance could be for
 
04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
bad behavior but it has to be
 
04:18:50.550 --> 04:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
a super majority of of uh four out of
 
04:18:53.189 --> 04:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
five voting uh yes
 
04:18:55.349 --> 04:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
that's just one one more town
 
04:18:57.349 --> 04:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
yes representative tripp
 
04:18:59.349 --> 04:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
i don't like i want to say that i agree
 
04:19:01.030 --> 04:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
with representative klee
 
04:19:03.030 --> 04:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
i think that if they're not doing the
 
04:19:04.950 --> 04:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
job they shouldn't get paid of course
 
04:19:07.590 --> 04:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
that has nothing to do with this bill so
 
04:19:09.510 --> 04:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:19:11.910 --> 04:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
04:19:14.309 --> 04:19:14.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'd like to um i have
 
04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%

provision
 
04:19:27.910 --> 04:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
with regard to but budget committee
 
04:19:30.710 --> 04:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
membership that a member shall cease to

that
 
04:19:42.070 --> 04:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
this is addressed in this bill and might
 
04:19:42.830 --> 04:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
be a
 
04:19:45.670 --> 04:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
conflict representative
 
04:19:47.189 --> 04:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry there was one more thing i
 
04:19:49.510 --> 04:19:49.520 align:start position:0%

04:20:00.640 --> 04:20:01.429 align:start position:0%
um i put that it must be amended to 75
so

04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:20:03.269 --> 04:20:03.279 align:start position:0%
i think that was a typo and we don't
 
04:20:05.670 --> 04:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
have an amendment to fix that so that
 
04:20:07.510 --> 04:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
alone um
 
04:20:09.670 --> 04:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
should kind of negate this
 
04:20:11.830 --> 04:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is written
 
04:20:14.149 --> 04:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:20:16.229 --> 04:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie
 
04:20:17.990 --> 04:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'd just like to
 
04:20:21.110 --> 04:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
say that my experiences most of the
 
04:20:22.790 --> 04:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
communities have
 
04:20:24.950 --> 04:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
their own policy and
 
04:20:27.670 --> 04:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
it pretty much works out pretty good i
 
04:20:30.070 --> 04:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
also suggest to you you have one heck of
 
04:20:32.950 --> 04:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
a job getting rid of an elected official
 
04:20:34.870 --> 04:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
on any board
 
04:20:37.110 --> 04:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
and i think with that
 
04:20:38.710 --> 04:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
you're probably right uh yes
 
04:20:41.590 --> 04:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative platt mr chairman i'm i'm
 
04:20:43.830 --> 04:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
doing my job as town budget committee in
 
04:20:49.349 --> 04:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:51.510 --> 04:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
yes you have a question representative
 
04:20:51.520 --> 04:20:54.469 align:start position:0%
yes you have a question representative
yes

04:20:54.469 --> 04:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:20:57.349 --> 04:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
there seems to be uh some discrepancies
 
04:20:59.110 --> 04:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
between this bill i
 
04:21:01.750 --> 04:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
would suggest an interim study on this
 
04:21:03.590 --> 04:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
if that
 
04:21:05.750 --> 04:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh itl didn't pass
 
04:21:05.760 --> 04:21:06.950 align:start position:0%
uh itl didn't pass
okay

04:21:06.950 --> 04:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:21:09.110 --> 04:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
no noted it doesn't take a higher
 
04:21:10.550 --> 04:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
priority than what we're already looking
 
04:21:12.309 --> 04:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
at yes representative
 
04:21:12.319 --> 04:21:14.389 align:start position:0%
at yes representative

04:21:14.389 --> 04:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
manjapudi
 
04:21:16.630 --> 04:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'm so glad you don't
 
04:21:19.349 --> 04:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
forget my name
 
04:21:22.950 --> 04:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair just made it um
 
04:21:26.070 --> 04:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
in my notes it you know uh
 
04:21:29.030 --> 04:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
nhma said this could be addressed by
 
04:21:32.630 --> 04:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
bylaw at the local level so if they have
 
04:21:34.469 --> 04:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
a bylaw you know you miss so many
 
04:21:38.469 --> 04:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
meetings and again i think the notes uh
 
04:21:40.790 --> 04:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
also indicate for me that this is
 
04:21:43.510 --> 04:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
establishing an alternative to a
 
04:21:45.830 --> 04:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
democratic process which is already in
 
04:21:45.840 --> 04:21:46.550 align:start position:0%
democratic process which is already in
play

04:21:46.550 --> 04:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
play
 
04:21:49.990 --> 04:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
place where the voters elect these uh
 
04:21:53.830 --> 04:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
members and to be removed by the
 
04:21:56.229 --> 04:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
voters would be the
 
04:21:57.990 --> 04:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
right way and
 
04:22:00.469 --> 04:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
or having a bylaw and which is already
 
04:22:02.620 --> 04:22:02.630 align:start position:0%
in place so this seems
 
04:22:02.630 --> 04:22:03.750 align:start position:0%
in place so this seems
[Music]

04:22:03.750 --> 04:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:22:05.590 --> 04:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
establishing a
 
04:22:05.600 --> 04:22:07.189 align:start position:0%
establishing a
bypass

04:22:07.189 --> 04:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
bypass
 
04:22:11.910 --> 04:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:14.710 --> 04:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
yes represent my jury thank you mr chair
 
04:22:17.030 --> 04:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
and i would argue i think i'm piling on
 
04:22:21.110 --> 04:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
that statute 91a already says that you
 
04:22:23.510 --> 04:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
may allow these you may allow somebody
 
04:22:25.030 --> 04:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
to participate
 
04:22:28.149 --> 04:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh if they're absent for whatever reason
 
04:22:30.309 --> 04:22:30.319 align:start position:0%
and the budget committee decides that
 
04:22:32.309 --> 04:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
they are not going to allow that person
 
04:22:35.349 --> 04:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
to participate so be it they
 
04:22:35.359 --> 04:22:36.229 align:start position:0%
to participate so be it they
so

04:22:36.229 --> 04:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:22:37.590 --> 04:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
only if the budget committee finds
 
04:22:39.670 --> 04:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
extenuating circumstances and allows the
 
04:22:42.149 --> 04:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
participation is already covered in 92
 
04:22:45.349 --> 04:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
91a it seems to me to be duplicative and
 
04:22:46.550 --> 04:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
only is
 
04:22:48.229 --> 04:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
04:22:52.070 --> 04:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
somebody to say to file a court order to
 
04:22:52.080 --> 04:22:53.030 align:start position:0%
somebody to say to file a court order to
say

04:22:53.030 --> 04:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:22:55.269 --> 04:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh they have a disagreement i think this
 
04:22:57.590 --> 04:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
bill is looking for a prop looking for a
 
04:22:57.600 --> 04:22:59.189 align:start position:0%
bill is looking for a prop looking for a
problem

04:22:59.189 --> 04:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:23:00.710 --> 04:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:23:02.229 --> 04:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
what's going to be your recommendation
 
04:23:04.790 --> 04:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
of that of that
 
04:23:06.309 --> 04:23:06.319 align:start position:0%

04:26:13.349 --> 04:26:13.359 align:start position:0%
we have to notice it all right
 
04:26:16.710 --> 04:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
we have a volunteer to write the uh
 
04:26:18.870 --> 04:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
majority report
 
04:26:20.950 --> 04:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
no it's a minority
 
04:26:23.110 --> 04:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
you've got it i just need a minority
 
04:26:25.189 --> 04:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
yeah we get the minority no we don't no
 
04:26:27.590 --> 04:26:27.600 align:start position:0%

04:26:33.590 --> 04:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:35.110 --> 04:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
you got to give us the minority i mean
 
04:26:37.429 --> 04:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
the majority once in a while
 
04:26:43.670 --> 04:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:50.630 --> 04:26:50.640 align:start position:0%

04:27:00.790 --> 04:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
i voted with a majority so i i don't
 
04:27:02.630 --> 04:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
think it would be fair to steal the

minorities thunder maybe representative
 
04:27:19.910 --> 04:27:19.920 align:start position:0%

04:27:40.790 --> 04:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
it was itl 12 12-7 i thought it was in a
 
04:27:40.800 --> 04:27:42.229 align:start position:0%
it was itl 12 12-7 i thought it was in a
majority

04:27:42.229 --> 04:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
majority
 
04:27:43.429 --> 04:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
i know
 
04:27:45.269 --> 04:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
i believe so yeah you are in the
 
04:27:45.279 --> 04:27:48.950 align:start position:0%
i believe so yeah you are in the
majority

04:27:48.950 --> 04:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:08.550 --> 04:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:10.309 --> 04:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
i would just like to
 
04:28:11.910 --> 04:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
make everyone
 
04:28:14.790 --> 04:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
aware that i enjoyed the railroad
 
04:28:14.800 --> 04:28:32.469 align:start position:0%
aware that i enjoyed the railroad
stories

04:28:32.469 --> 04:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:37.990 --> 04:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:41.110 --> 04:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
let's keep this on track
 
04:28:41.120 --> 04:28:42.070 align:start position:0%
let's keep this on track
okay

04:28:42.070 --> 04:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:28:44.870 --> 04:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
okay we're gonna adjourn we have uh
 
04:28:46.630 --> 04:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
04:28:53.269 --> 04:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:55.269 --> 04:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
no we apparently we can't
 
04:28:57.269 --> 04:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
we're still waiting for the amendment so
 
04:28:59.269 --> 04:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes
 
04:29:01.910 --> 04:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh there's another possibility
 
04:29:05.830 --> 04:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh as i was uh discussing with
 
04:29:08.630 --> 04:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative power and representative
 
04:29:08.640 --> 04:29:09.590 align:start position:0%
representative power and representative
clee

04:29:09.590 --> 04:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
clee
 
04:29:12.790 --> 04:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
about the the two changes and also
 
04:29:14.469 --> 04:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
representative tripp
 
04:29:16.710 --> 04:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
about the two um
 
04:29:19.429 --> 04:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
scribing changes
 
04:29:21.670 --> 04:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
the person from new hampshire municipal
 
04:29:21.680 --> 04:29:23.030 align:start position:0%
the person from new hampshire municipal
association

04:29:23.030 --> 04:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
association
 
04:29:24.950 --> 04:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
said that it's their position that they
 
04:29:26.870 --> 04:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
think the whole bill may in fact be
 
04:29:26.880 --> 04:29:28.469 align:start position:0%
think the whole bill may in fact be
redundant

04:29:28.469 --> 04:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
redundant
 
04:29:30.469 --> 04:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
and say the same thing
 
04:29:31.590 --> 04:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:29:34.149 --> 04:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to ask their opinion at
 
04:29:35.349 --> 04:29:35.359 align:start position:0%
this point
 
04:29:37.990 --> 04:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
we might be more inclined to simply itl
 
04:29:39.030 --> 04:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:29:40.870 --> 04:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
because i don't have the amendment yet
 
04:29:43.510 --> 04:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
and they promised it to me and
 
04:29:45.349 --> 04:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
i don't see it coming
 
04:29:51.189 --> 04:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:53.510 --> 04:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
can we put you on the spot and ask your
 
04:29:53.520 --> 04:29:55.110 align:start position:0%
can we put you on the spot and ask your
opinion

04:29:55.110 --> 04:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
04:29:56.950 --> 04:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
no no we can't we're in executive
 
04:29:58.309 --> 04:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
session we can't do that
 
04:30:08.170 --> 04:30:08.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:08.180 --> 04:30:11.189 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:30:11.189 --> 04:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:30:27.030 --> 04:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:30.630 --> 04:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:30.640 --> 04:30:31.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:30:31.590 --> 04:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:30:35.750 --> 04:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:37.510 --> 04:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
my name is katherine heck i'm with the
 
04:30:39.189 --> 04:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association and
 
04:30:45.110 --> 04:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:47.030 --> 04:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
well what we're
 
04:30:50.710 --> 04:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:53.590 --> 04:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh hb 1184 which is
 
04:30:56.389 --> 04:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
the which would authorize
 
04:31:00.229 --> 04:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
towns and municipalities
 
04:31:04.229 --> 04:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
to establish a revolving fund
 
04:31:06.389 --> 04:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
so if you read
 
04:31:09.269 --> 04:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
page 2
 
04:31:13.030 --> 04:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
line six to amend rsa 44
 
04:31:15.670 --> 04:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
cities are already allowed to
 
04:31:17.830 --> 04:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
establish and use revolving funds for
 
04:31:20.870 --> 04:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
all the purposes created because the rsa
 
04:31:23.830 --> 04:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
allows them to do anything a town can do
 
04:31:26.630 --> 04:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
so it's redundant that language and in
 
04:31:30.550 --> 04:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
village districts which would start
 
04:31:33.110 --> 04:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
on page three line three
 
04:31:35.750 --> 04:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
rsa 52 already permits a village
 
04:31:37.590 --> 04:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
district for the purpose for which it
 
04:31:40.630 --> 04:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
was created to do anything a town can do
 
04:31:43.349 --> 04:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
but only within its purpose so they also
 
04:31:45.990 --> 04:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
if can create a revolving fund for that
 
04:31:46.000 --> 04:31:47.830 align:start position:0%
if can create a revolving fund for that
purpose

04:31:47.830 --> 04:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
04:31:50.229 --> 04:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
counties we don't take a position on so
 
04:31:53.349 --> 04:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
this legislation had been targeted and
 
04:31:55.269 --> 04:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
geared toward counties
 
04:31:57.590 --> 04:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
so that's um our position is that this
 
04:32:00.469 --> 04:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
language is completely redundant and
 
04:32:03.510 --> 04:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
most likely unnecessary as cities and
 
04:32:05.830 --> 04:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
village districts can already establish
 
04:32:09.269 --> 04:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
revolving funds thank you catherine uh
 
04:32:10.389 --> 04:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
given that
 
04:32:12.469 --> 04:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
additional information what do you all
 
04:32:12.479 --> 04:32:15.510 align:start position:0%
additional information what do you all
think

04:32:15.510 --> 04:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:16.550 --> 04:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
i'd like to
 
04:32:33.030 --> 04:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:35.030 --> 04:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
for further work so there's no no motion
 
04:32:39.110 --> 04:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:40.870 --> 04:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative wrong
 
04:32:44.229 --> 04:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
yeah i realize miss heck that cities
 
04:32:46.389 --> 04:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
towns and village districts already have
 
04:32:48.870 --> 04:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
the power to set up a revolving fund but
 
04:32:50.790 --> 04:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
what about counties
 
04:32:52.790 --> 04:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
i think when when representative lang
 
04:32:54.469 --> 04:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill
 
04:32:57.189 --> 04:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
he he meant that he wanted to extend the
 
04:32:59.269 --> 04:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
capabilities of having revolving funds
 
04:33:02.630 --> 04:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
to counties in addition to cities and
 
04:33:04.949 --> 04:33:04.959 align:start position:0%
village districts
 
04:33:06.869 --> 04:33:06.879 align:start position:0%
i recall his testimony and when he
 
04:33:08.470 --> 04:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill and that is correct
 
04:33:10.551 --> 04:33:10.561 align:start position:0%
he wanted to extend
 
04:33:12.470 --> 04:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
that ability to counties which is
 
04:33:14.150 --> 04:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
currently not
 
04:33:16.869 --> 04:33:16.879 align:start position:0%
in the rsa that a county can create a
 
04:33:19.590 --> 04:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
revolving or establish a revolving fund
 
04:33:21.349 --> 04:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
but we have no position on the county
 
04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
portion all right representative uh van
 
04:33:26.709 --> 04:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
was that one of the corrections
 
04:33:26.719 --> 04:33:27.510 align:start position:0%
was that one of the corrections
well

04:33:27.510 --> 04:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:33:30.070 --> 04:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
i talked to ols about it and they said
 
04:33:31.349 --> 04:33:31.359 align:start position:0%
that they
 
04:33:31.359 --> 04:33:32.310 align:start position:0%
that they
uh

04:33:32.310 --> 04:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:33:34.150 --> 04:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
since the primary sponsor was there i
 
04:33:35.830 --> 04:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
was only there to fix the scribing
 
04:33:38.789 --> 04:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
errors and they said that by the end of
 
04:33:41.029 --> 04:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
the day today they could not
 
04:33:45.429 --> 04:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
fix all that they acknowledged that
 
04:33:47.670 --> 04:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns the cities towns
 
04:33:49.590 --> 04:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
and village districts could already do
 
04:33:49.600 --> 04:33:51.109 align:start position:0%
and village districts could already do
this

04:33:51.109 --> 04:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:33:53.029 --> 04:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
they agreed that that language was all
 
04:33:56.070 --> 04:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:56.080 --> 04:33:56.869 align:start position:0%
 
my

04:33:56.869 --> 04:33:56.879 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:33:58.629 --> 04:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
sense at this point is that we'd be
 
04:34:01.510 --> 04:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
better off itlling this bill
 
04:34:05.109 --> 04:34:05.119 align:start position:0%
and making a better stab at it next time
 
04:34:07.590 --> 04:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
because it's going to create confusion i
 
04:34:07.600 --> 04:34:09.990 align:start position:0%
because it's going to create confusion i
think

04:34:09.990 --> 04:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:11.590 --> 04:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
by saying the same thing in several
 
04:34:13.670 --> 04:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
different places okay any additional
 
04:34:13.680 --> 04:34:16.150 align:start position:0%
different places okay any additional
input

04:34:16.150 --> 04:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:18.629 --> 04:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
yes representative power
 
04:34:20.869 --> 04:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i was just curious to
 
04:34:22.390 --> 04:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
to understand
 
04:34:24.230 --> 04:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
do counties
 
04:34:26.949 --> 04:34:26.959 align:start position:0%
engage in activities
 
04:34:33.109 --> 04:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:33.990 --> 04:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
i i
 
04:34:36.310 --> 04:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
i i meant seven through
 
04:34:36.320 --> 04:34:37.590 align:start position:0%
i i meant seven through
um

04:34:37.590 --> 04:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:37.600 --> 04:34:39.590 align:start position:0%
um
18.

04:34:39.590 --> 04:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
18.
 
04:34:41.910 --> 04:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that currently they
 
04:34:44.390 --> 04:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
do not engage in all of those activities
 
04:34:49.029 --> 04:34:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:53.510 --> 04:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:56.070 --> 04:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
i think the only thing that because the
 
04:34:58.869 --> 04:34:58.879 align:start position:0%
counties are only responsible for ambula
 
04:35:00.310 --> 04:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
04:35:01.750 --> 04:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
elderly care
 
04:35:04.551 --> 04:35:04.561 align:start position:0%
nursing home and correctional
 
04:35:07.510 --> 04:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
so only the ambulance service
 
04:35:10.709 --> 04:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
or something like that in that
 
04:35:12.949 --> 04:35:12.959 align:start position:0%
safety providing public safety services
 
04:35:15.029 --> 04:35:15.039 align:start position:0%
those are the only two categories that
 
04:35:17.750 --> 04:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
might affect the county at the county
 
04:35:17.760 --> 04:35:19.109 align:start position:0%
might affect the county at the county
level

04:35:19.109 --> 04:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:35:21.349 --> 04:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of sheriffs out there too
 
04:35:25.349 --> 04:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's what public safety and uh
 
04:35:26.709 --> 04:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
senior care
 
04:35:29.269 --> 04:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
not the energy not
 
04:35:33.189 --> 04:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:35.590 --> 04:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative wrong yes thank
 
04:35:37.109 --> 04:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
04:35:37.119 --> 04:35:38.629 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
um

04:35:38.629 --> 04:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:40.230 --> 04:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
i know we all want to get out of here
 
04:35:40.240 --> 04:35:41.189 align:start position:0%
i know we all want to get out of here
but

04:35:41.189 --> 04:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:35:43.109 --> 04:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
i i do think that
 
04:35:46.230 --> 04:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
it is fair to extend revolving funds to
 
04:35:48.551 --> 04:35:48.561 align:start position:0%
counties and our problem may be solved
 
04:35:51.429 --> 04:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
if we just strike out section two
 
04:35:53.029 --> 04:35:53.039 align:start position:0%
to the end of the bill and just keep
 
04:35:55.750 --> 04:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
section one what refers to county
 
04:35:55.760 --> 04:35:57.109 align:start position:0%
section one what refers to county
um

04:35:57.109 --> 04:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:59.429 --> 04:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
my uh
 
04:36:02.230 --> 04:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
you know i i look at county activities
 
04:36:04.869 --> 04:36:04.879 align:start position:0%
and and revolving from to me would be
 
04:36:06.949 --> 04:36:06.959 align:start position:0%
very appropriate for let's say county
 
04:36:09.189 --> 04:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
fairs you know where they are taking in
 
04:36:11.349 --> 04:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
revenue it is just defined for that
 
04:36:14.150 --> 04:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
purpose it would make the administration
 
04:36:16.070 --> 04:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
and the organization and management of
 
04:36:18.551 --> 04:36:18.561 align:start position:0%
county fairs more efficient if they had
 
04:36:21.590 --> 04:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
access to that fund outside of their
 
04:36:23.189 --> 04:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
normal budget
 
04:36:26.470 --> 04:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:28.949 --> 04:36:28.959 align:start position:0%
i don't know i i'm going to if there is
 
04:36:31.590 --> 04:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
a motion to itl i'm going to oppose it
 
04:36:31.600 --> 04:36:33.029 align:start position:0%
a motion to itl i'm going to oppose it
and

04:36:33.029 --> 04:36:33.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:36:35.029 --> 04:36:35.039 align:start position:0%
hope that we can get an amendment that
 
04:36:39.429 --> 04:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
only maintains section one
 
04:36:41.429 --> 04:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
and i would be happy if
 
04:36:45.590 --> 04:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
to go and get that amendment
 
04:36:47.910 --> 04:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
04:36:49.510 --> 04:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
i hear what you're saying i think what
 
04:36:51.590 --> 04:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
we might do is
 
04:36:53.349 --> 04:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
scrub that uh
 
04:36:55.269 --> 04:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
that bill and see if we can
 
04:36:58.150 --> 04:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
do without it like you're suggesting but
 
04:37:01.109 --> 04:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
i haven't had a chance to uh
 
04:37:05.429 --> 04:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:07.830 --> 04:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
would the committee
 
04:37:10.150 --> 04:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
indulge me five minutes and then we can
 
04:37:12.230 --> 04:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
dispose of this bill
 
04:37:13.990 --> 04:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh i think i can go through it in five
 
04:37:14.000 --> 04:37:15.670 align:start position:0%
uh i think i can go through it in five
minutes

04:37:15.670 --> 04:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
04:37:17.750 --> 04:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
good all right uh we're gonna take a
 
04:37:36.949 --> 04:37:36.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:39.109 --> 04:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
she said that if we just struck out two
 
04:37:53.670 --> 04:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:53.680 --> 04:37:54.830 align:start position:0%
 
these

04:37:54.830 --> 04:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:37:54.840 --> 04:37:56.470 align:start position:0%
these
instructs

04:37:56.470 --> 04:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
instructs
 
04:37:59.109 --> 04:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
i can count keeping the county just the
 
04:38:18.310 --> 04:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:18.320 --> 04:38:29.269 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:38:29.269 --> 04:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:29.279 --> 04:38:50.709 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:38:50.709 --> 04:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:50.719 --> 04:38:53.029 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:38:53.029 --> 04:38:53.039 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:38:55.510 --> 04:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the last provision
 
04:38:57.349 --> 04:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
for the counties that the legislative
 
04:38:59.910 --> 04:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
body can adopt and read just this one
 
04:38:59.920 --> 04:39:01.029 align:start position:0%
body can adopt and read just this one
line

04:39:01.029 --> 04:39:01.039 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:39:02.789 --> 04:39:02.799 align:start position:0%
any purpose
 
04:39:02.799 --> 04:39:04.150 align:start position:0%
any purpose
otherwise

04:39:04.150 --> 04:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
04:39:08.709 --> 04:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:11.269 --> 04:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
but the problem i have is right now this
 
04:39:13.750 --> 04:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
new language which is in the
 
04:39:13.760 --> 04:39:14.949 align:start position:0%
new language which is in the
in

04:39:14.949 --> 04:39:14.959 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:39:16.709 --> 04:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
04:39:18.789 --> 04:39:18.799 align:start position:0%
talks about county
 
04:39:20.629 --> 04:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
and if we
 
04:39:22.709 --> 04:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
unless we strike this
 
04:39:23.910 --> 04:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
well that's what i'm saying but if it
 
04:39:23.920 --> 04:39:27.429 align:start position:0%
well that's what i'm saying but if it
was

04:39:27.429 --> 04:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:30.109 --> 04:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
anything for which
 
04:39:30.119 --> 04:39:36.470 align:start position:0%
anything for which
[Music]

04:39:36.470 --> 04:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:38.070 --> 04:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
i was going to ask
 
04:39:40.708 --> 04:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
van but do you know
 
04:39:58.230 --> 04:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:58.240 --> 04:39:59.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:39:59.430 --> 04:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:40:03.990 --> 04:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:18.230 --> 04:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:31.750 --> 04:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:34.470 --> 04:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
okay we've been having discussions about
 
04:40:40.070 --> 04:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
how we uh clean this up uh 11 hb 1184
 
04:40:42.310 --> 04:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
and it was a suggestion was made that we
 
04:40:42.320 --> 04:40:43.030 align:start position:0%
and it was a suggestion was made that we
could

04:40:43.030 --> 04:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:40:44.868 --> 04:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
delete uh
 
04:40:46.868 --> 04:40:46.878 align:start position:0%
a few paragraphs and we would almost be
 
04:40:46.878 --> 04:40:47.750 align:start position:0%
a few paragraphs and we would almost be
there

04:40:47.750 --> 04:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:40:50.628 --> 04:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
uh i've had that conference with several
 
04:40:52.310 --> 04:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
of you
 
04:40:52.320 --> 04:40:53.590 align:start position:0%
of you
and

04:40:53.590 --> 04:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:40:55.350 --> 04:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
what we've decided
 
04:40:57.430 --> 04:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
you know i'll ask you all to confirm
 
04:41:00.390 --> 04:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
this what we've decided is
 
04:41:02.070 --> 04:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
there's just there's just too much
 
04:41:04.070 --> 04:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
messed up in this bill right now and
 
04:41:05.190 --> 04:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
04:41:08.948 --> 04:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:11.830 --> 04:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
co co-authors co-sponsors here to to
 
04:41:13.110 --> 04:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
help us out so
 
04:41:17.510 --> 04:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
i i'm going to suggest that we itl
 
04:41:21.830 --> 04:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:24.390 --> 04:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative loseless
 
04:41:26.470 --> 04:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
mr chairman it seems
 
04:41:26.480 --> 04:41:27.270 align:start position:0%
mr chairman it seems
that

04:41:27.270 --> 04:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:41:29.430 --> 04:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
there is a need for
 
04:41:29.440 --> 04:41:30.708 align:start position:0%
there is a need for
counties

04:41:30.708 --> 04:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
counties
 
04:41:33.990 --> 04:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
to have a revolving fund
 
04:41:38.708 --> 04:41:38.718 align:start position:0%
there is that need i and i can see where
 
04:41:41.590 --> 04:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
like police details
 
04:41:43.750 --> 04:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't we want to have a revolving
 
04:41:46.230 --> 04:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
fund for county sheriffs to
 
04:41:49.350 --> 04:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
serve on police details
 
04:41:49.360 --> 04:41:50.150 align:start position:0%
serve on police details
so

04:41:50.150 --> 04:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:41:52.708 --> 04:41:52.718 align:start position:0%
knowing that there is a need rather than
 
04:41:54.390 --> 04:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
itlling it
 
04:41:56.390 --> 04:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be more appropriate to do an
 
04:41:58.948 --> 04:41:58.958 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
04:42:00.868 --> 04:42:00.878 align:start position:0%
that's possible
 
04:42:04.628 --> 04:42:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:06.788 --> 04:42:06.798 align:start position:0%
yes representative mr chair and
 
04:42:08.550 --> 04:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
practical matter in the second year of
 
04:42:10.948 --> 04:42:10.958 align:start position:0%
return and i tl and i associate the same
 
04:42:10.958 --> 04:42:11.750 align:start position:0%
return and i tl and i associate the same
thing

04:42:11.750 --> 04:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:42:14.470 --> 04:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
interim study kills it the author could
 
04:42:16.150 --> 04:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
come back with a new bill just on
 
04:42:16.160 --> 04:42:17.590 align:start position:0%
come back with a new bill just on
counties

04:42:17.590 --> 04:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
counties
 
04:42:18.948 --> 04:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what i'm thinking it's a new
 
04:42:20.788 --> 04:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
bill just for counties yes
 
04:42:22.788 --> 04:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
representative ron
 
04:42:25.750 --> 04:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
is it possible if if the itl i don't
 
04:42:26.948 --> 04:42:26.958 align:start position:0%
think there's a motion on the floor but
 
04:42:29.030 --> 04:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
if there was an itl motion on the floor
 
04:42:30.390 --> 04:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
and it failed
 
04:42:30.400 --> 04:42:31.270 align:start position:0%
and it failed
um

04:42:31.270 --> 04:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:31.280 --> 04:42:32.470 align:start position:0%
um
could

04:42:32.470 --> 04:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:42:34.628 --> 04:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
could i come back next at our next
 
04:42:36.310 --> 04:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
meeting with an amendment that just
 
04:42:38.628 --> 04:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
addresses county we have to do it today
 
04:42:39.670 --> 04:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
the only
 
04:42:39.680 --> 04:42:41.910 align:start position:0%
the only
uh

04:42:41.910 --> 04:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:42:43.830 --> 04:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
little little amount of room i have with
 
04:42:45.670 --> 04:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
that is if it's the last bill of the day
 
04:42:48.310 --> 04:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
we don't finish
 
04:42:50.628 --> 04:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
oh okay so we can't bring this up in our
 
04:42:52.390 --> 04:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
next exact session
 
04:42:55.590 --> 04:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
okay if if we were talking about 12 23
 
04:42:57.750 --> 04:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
the answer might be different
 
04:42:59.110 --> 04:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
04:43:01.350 --> 04:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
you follow what i'm saying
 
04:43:02.788 --> 04:43:02.798 align:start position:0%
this is this is
 
04:43:04.868 --> 04:43:04.878 align:start position:0%
it may not make sense but
 
04:43:07.030 --> 04:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
we all have uh rules we have to follow
 
04:43:10.230 --> 04:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
and that that's her uh mrs smith
 
04:43:13.590 --> 04:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
well um a question mr chair
 
04:43:15.830 --> 04:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
didn't we do that on didn't we do a bill
 
04:43:17.030 --> 04:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
today that we were supposed to do
 
04:43:17.040 --> 04:43:19.270 align:start position:0%
today that we were supposed to do
yesterday

04:43:19.270 --> 04:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
04:43:19.280 --> 04:43:20.628 align:start position:0%
yesterday
10.70

04:43:20.628 --> 04:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
10.70
 
04:43:22.708 --> 04:43:22.718 align:start position:0%
oh was that it yeah we carried over a
 
04:43:25.030 --> 04:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
bill from yesterday that we didn't take
 
04:43:27.430 --> 04:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
action on
 
04:43:27.440 --> 04:43:29.110 align:start position:0%
action on
um

04:43:29.110 --> 04:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:31.510 --> 04:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
we reconsidered that
 
04:43:33.750 --> 04:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
it was passed and it was reconsidered
 
04:43:36.150 --> 04:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
and the world changed there was no i
 
04:43:41.830 --> 04:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:43.910 --> 04:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
yeah it was it was the last bill of the
 
04:43:45.990 --> 04:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
day oh the last bill from yesterday we
 
04:43:48.708 --> 04:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
did today so that's that's our only uh
 
04:43:51.990 --> 04:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:55.430 --> 04:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
in that situation okay
 
04:43:56.948 --> 04:43:56.958 align:start position:0%
i know it seems weird but that's the way
 
04:43:58.070 --> 04:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
it is yes
 
04:43:59.750 --> 04:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
i know this is gonna sound convoluted
 
04:44:01.750 --> 04:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
but could we not vote on it and then
 
04:44:03.590 --> 04:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
reconsider it tomorrow as you did with
 
04:44:03.600 --> 04:44:05.030 align:start position:0%
reconsider it tomorrow as you did with
1070.

04:44:05.030 --> 04:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
1070.
 
04:44:13.990 --> 04:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:16.470 --> 04:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
may ask a question mr chair
 
04:44:16.480 --> 04:44:17.670 align:start position:0%
may ask a question mr chair
yes

04:44:17.670 --> 04:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:44:19.750 --> 04:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:44:21.430 --> 04:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
if we do that
 
04:44:25.350 --> 04:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:27.910 --> 04:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
into what you might want it to be to
 
04:44:31.830 --> 04:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:31.840 --> 04:44:32.628 align:start position:0%
 
or

04:44:32.628 --> 04:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:44:35.110 --> 04:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
just counties where this is redundant
 
04:44:36.550 --> 04:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
that it already has
 
04:44:36.560 --> 04:44:37.670 align:start position:0%
that it already has
cities

04:44:37.670 --> 04:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
cities
 
04:44:37.680 --> 04:44:38.788 align:start position:0%
cities
villages

04:44:38.788 --> 04:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
villages
 
04:44:38.798 --> 04:44:40.070 align:start position:0%
villages
towns

04:44:40.070 --> 04:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
towns
 
04:44:42.070 --> 04:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
so if the goal is to include the
 
04:44:42.080 --> 04:44:43.830 align:start position:0%
so if the goal is to include the
counties

04:44:43.830 --> 04:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
counties
 
04:44:48.390 --> 04:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:48.400 --> 04:44:49.350 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:44:49.350 --> 04:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:44:52.868 --> 04:44:52.878 align:start position:0%
if you either interim study or itl today
 
04:44:54.310 --> 04:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know how you can get over less
 
04:44:56.470 --> 04:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
to act on an amendment
 
04:44:59.190 --> 04:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh and so it'd be possible to bring it
 
04:45:00.390 --> 04:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
back so the only thing you could do
 
04:45:02.470 --> 04:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
today is ought to pass
 
04:45:02.480 --> 04:45:03.670 align:start position:0%
today is ought to pass
uh

04:45:03.670 --> 04:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:45:05.830 --> 04:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
and then reconsider that but you could i
 
04:45:07.830 --> 04:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
don't know i i'm just procedurally how
 
04:45:10.628 --> 04:45:10.638 align:start position:0%
you get a wellness to act if it's not
 
04:45:13.430 --> 04:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
if it's got any vote on it mr chairman
 
04:45:17.030 --> 04:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
what happens if we take no action
 
04:45:18.550 --> 04:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
04:45:20.390 --> 04:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
take no action
 
04:45:21.670 --> 04:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
does that mean
 
04:45:23.910 --> 04:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
that it's just we still own the bill and
 
04:45:25.510 --> 04:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
we can take it up at any time what
 
04:45:30.470 --> 04:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:34.150 --> 04:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:34.160 --> 04:45:35.110 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:45:35.110 --> 04:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:45:35.120 --> 04:45:36.150 align:start position:0%
yes
the

04:45:36.150 --> 04:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:45:38.550 --> 04:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
report said to me before friday
 
04:45:41.030 --> 04:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
so that shoots that off
 
04:45:42.310 --> 04:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
the actions you want to then want to
 
04:45:47.270 --> 04:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:50.550 --> 04:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
well i'm i am tiptoeing around
 
04:45:52.390 --> 04:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
around the edge of the rule so please
 
04:45:57.990 --> 04:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:02.070 --> 04:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
one suggestion i just heard that
 
04:46:03.830 --> 04:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
i think i can swallow is
 
04:46:06.150 --> 04:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
is to otp
 
04:46:08.470 --> 04:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
and then reconsider that
 
04:46:11.110 --> 04:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
but even then if you otp how do you go
 
04:46:13.990 --> 04:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
to ols for any kind of amendment when
 
04:46:16.230 --> 04:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
you passed a bill yeah we think we'd
 
04:46:17.750 --> 04:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
have to do we'd have to have an
 
04:46:19.990 --> 04:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
understanding and i think representative
 
04:46:22.550 --> 04:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
wrong has some ideas that of what
 
04:46:22.560 --> 04:46:24.150 align:start position:0%
wrong has some ideas that of what
strikeouts

04:46:24.150 --> 04:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
strikeouts
 
04:46:25.830 --> 04:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
have to be made
 
04:46:28.230 --> 04:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
yeah it really it's just keeping section
 
04:46:28.240 --> 04:46:29.350 align:start position:0%
yeah it really it's just keeping section
one

04:46:29.350 --> 04:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:46:31.990 --> 04:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
because the section two which revolves
 
04:46:35.190 --> 04:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
cities in section three which involves
 
04:46:37.590 --> 04:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
village districts are redundant we don't
 
04:46:40.230 --> 04:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
need those we just need section one
 
04:46:42.948 --> 04:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
we just would be adding counties
 
04:46:42.958 --> 04:46:43.750 align:start position:0%
we just would be adding counties
um

04:46:43.750 --> 04:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:46.230 --> 04:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
you know enabling them to have because
 
04:46:48.708 --> 04:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
it's enabling it's a county may by vote
 
04:46:50.628 --> 04:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
of the county delegation establish a
 
04:46:54.390 --> 04:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:57.430 --> 04:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i think we can just ask ols to
 
04:46:58.868 --> 04:46:58.878 align:start position:0%
do that they don't check to see what
 
04:47:01.190 --> 04:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
we've done with the bill
 
04:47:06.868 --> 04:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:09.030 --> 04:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
anything anybody else have an input on
 
04:47:12.150 --> 04:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:15.190 --> 04:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
mr chair should we should we um
 
04:47:18.230 --> 04:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
contact um the honorable uh clerk uh
 
04:47:20.390 --> 04:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
paul smith to see if it's something that
 
04:47:22.788 --> 04:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
or should we just i see that uh
 
04:47:24.150 --> 04:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
representative majority came running in
 
04:47:25.670 --> 04:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
here with his hand up so he may have
 
04:47:27.510 --> 04:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
some news for us well i just wanted to
 
04:47:32.150 --> 04:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
say that that um heather needs to post
 
04:47:34.310 --> 04:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
the meeting pope needs to post the
 
04:47:37.350 --> 04:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
hearing on this i'm not sure that we can
 
04:47:39.270 --> 04:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
reconsider a vote on a bill without
 
04:47:41.670 --> 04:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
posting that bill so i don't i have no
 
04:47:43.510 --> 04:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
idea how that happens and she's going to
 
04:47:45.670 --> 04:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
be looking for us to post something the
 
04:47:49.510 --> 04:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
calendar limitation is today by thursday
 
04:47:51.750 --> 04:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
all postings have to be input to the to
 
04:47:53.190 --> 04:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
the clerk
 
04:47:55.430 --> 04:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
and that's close of business thursday
 
04:47:59.430 --> 04:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah i i hate to put a
 
04:48:01.430 --> 04:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
a little crimp in this but the la the
 
04:48:02.948 --> 04:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
next two
 
04:48:02.958 --> 04:48:04.230 align:start position:0%
next two
calendars

04:48:04.230 --> 04:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
calendars
 
04:48:06.310 --> 04:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
um for this have already been revised
 
04:48:08.708 --> 04:48:08.718 align:start position:0%
and i know you can't revise
 
04:48:12.390 --> 04:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh you can't revise a revised agenda
 
04:48:15.750 --> 04:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
so i don't we can't purposely do it but
 
04:48:15.760 --> 04:48:16.788 align:start position:0%
so i don't we can't purposely do it but
if

04:48:16.788 --> 04:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:48:20.070 --> 04:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
we voted on it and then just like today
 
04:48:22.628 --> 04:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
suddenly something became reconsidered
 
04:48:24.070 --> 04:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
that could be done as long as it wasn't
 
04:48:26.390 --> 04:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
handed into the clerk beforehand
 
04:48:28.310 --> 04:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's all i'm saying
 
04:48:30.868 --> 04:48:30.878 align:start position:0%
any other input
 
04:48:33.110 --> 04:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative power
 
04:48:35.990 --> 04:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
04:48:38.310 --> 04:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
i would advocate to itl the bill and
 
04:48:40.868 --> 04:48:40.878 align:start position:0%
then to
 
04:48:43.750 --> 04:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
have the sponsors rework this and bring
 
04:48:45.350 --> 04:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
it back
 
04:48:47.750 --> 04:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
and then redo the whole process i i feel
 
04:48:49.590 --> 04:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
very uncomfortable
 
04:48:51.910 --> 04:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
trying to do something so quickly
 
04:48:51.920 --> 04:48:53.190 align:start position:0%
trying to do something so quickly
piecemeal

04:48:53.190 --> 04:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
piecemeal
 
04:48:55.110 --> 04:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
we've gone through a couple of different
 
04:48:55.120 --> 04:48:56.708 align:start position:0%
we've gone through a couple of different
um

04:48:56.708 --> 04:48:56.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:59.590 --> 04:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
i guess iterations or suggestions of
 
04:49:01.910 --> 04:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
what an amendment would look like and
 
04:49:04.310 --> 04:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
this is not careful work
 
04:49:07.270 --> 04:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
so i recommend itlling it
 
04:49:08.868 --> 04:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
do you uh
 
04:49:10.788 --> 04:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
have the uh connections right now to
 
04:49:14.788 --> 04:49:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:17.030 --> 04:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
no no i don't
 
04:49:18.788 --> 04:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
know but we're going to bring it back
 
04:49:21.990 --> 04:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
next year next year oh right we can kill
 
04:49:25.910 --> 04:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
it yeah i think we're looking for for uh
 
04:49:29.510 --> 04:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
ways not to kill it if if uh if we otp'd
 
04:49:31.350 --> 04:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
it i'm gonna move towards whether if we
 
04:49:33.030 --> 04:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
if we did it
 
04:49:35.590 --> 04:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
yes i think that we can
 
04:49:37.990 --> 04:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
have the sponsors
 
04:49:40.390 --> 04:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
come back to us during another executive
 
04:49:42.390 --> 04:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
session and
 
04:49:43.830 --> 04:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
and ask us to
 
04:49:46.390 --> 04:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
to uh change it but i think that we're
 
04:49:48.390 --> 04:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
gonna have to wait till the next session
 
04:49:52.788 --> 04:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:55.590 --> 04:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
i just have a question
 
04:49:58.150 --> 04:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um
 
04:50:00.230 --> 04:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
there was a bill that i was a prime
 
04:50:02.788 --> 04:50:02.798 align:start position:0%
sponsor of that went to resources
 
04:50:05.430 --> 04:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
and they weren't ready to execute so it
 
04:50:08.150 --> 04:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
went on their next agenda
 
04:50:09.990 --> 04:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
is that something we can do since we
 
04:50:11.910 --> 04:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
haven't taken any action on this can we
 
04:50:14.628 --> 04:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
just well our agenda for next week has
 
04:50:17.990 --> 04:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
been posted oh that okay
 
04:50:18.000 --> 04:50:19.510 align:start position:0%
been posted oh that okay
okay

04:50:19.510 --> 04:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:50:19.520 --> 04:50:22.628 align:start position:0%
okay
representative

04:50:22.628 --> 04:50:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:22.638 --> 04:50:24.150 align:start position:0%
 
is

04:50:24.150 --> 04:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:50:44.230 --> 04:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:48.868 --> 04:50:48.878 align:start position:0%
is the opportunity for a floor amendment
 
04:50:50.868 --> 04:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
at the next session
 
04:50:53.350 --> 04:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
is that an opportunity
 
04:50:53.360 --> 04:50:55.270 align:start position:0%
is that an opportunity
[Music]

04:50:55.270 --> 04:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:51:00.470 --> 04:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:04.470 --> 04:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:07.510 --> 04:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
i i don't like the connotation of
 
04:51:07.520 --> 04:51:08.788 align:start position:0%
i i don't like the connotation of
itl

04:51:08.788 --> 04:51:08.798 align:start position:0%
itl
 
04:51:11.190 --> 04:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
so if it's legislation that we can
 
04:51:13.110 --> 04:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
possibly live with
 
04:51:17.030 --> 04:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
if we otp it and then on the floor
 
04:51:21.190 --> 04:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
as part of the session have a bipartisan
 
04:51:22.788 --> 04:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
floor amendment
 
04:51:24.390 --> 04:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
that would
 
04:51:25.510 --> 04:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
well the
 
04:51:25.520 --> 04:51:26.628 align:start position:0%
well the
only

04:51:26.628 --> 04:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
only
 
04:51:29.030 --> 04:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
caveat is that there's going to be a lot
 
04:51:31.190 --> 04:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
more than 19 people voting on it on the
 
04:51:32.628 --> 04:51:32.638 align:start position:0%
floor so
 
04:51:34.708 --> 04:51:34.718 align:start position:0%
you have to go round up all
 
04:51:36.390 --> 04:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
your minions and they have to go up and
 
04:51:38.230 --> 04:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
round up all their minions and it won't
 
04:51:39.990 --> 04:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
be 11
 
04:51:44.470 --> 04:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:46.708 --> 04:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
i mean if if
 
04:51:49.190 --> 04:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
the house votes it down they vote it
 
04:51:49.200 --> 04:51:50.070 align:start position:0%
the house votes it down they vote it
down

04:51:50.070 --> 04:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
down
 
04:51:51.190 --> 04:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
it's done
 
04:51:54.390 --> 04:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
but at least i i feel that there is a
 
04:52:01.030 --> 04:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:03.670 --> 04:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
i i think the clerk was next but i'm
 
04:52:05.670 --> 04:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
sorry if the clerk is willing to let me
 
04:52:05.680 --> 04:52:07.830 align:start position:0%
sorry if the clerk is willing to let me
speak

04:52:07.830 --> 04:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
speak
 
04:52:11.590 --> 04:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr clerk
 
04:52:14.390 --> 04:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
um this bill this bill now belongs to
 
04:52:15.910 --> 04:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
our committee
 
04:52:18.948 --> 04:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
and in my view it's our responsibility
 
04:52:21.510 --> 04:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
to move it one way or the other
 
04:52:21.520 --> 04:52:23.670 align:start position:0%
to move it one way or the other
uh

04:52:23.670 --> 04:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:52:26.230 --> 04:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
to if if we think that it's worth
 
04:52:29.030 --> 04:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
preserving somebody should move otp if
 
04:52:31.270 --> 04:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
we don't somebody should move itl but i
 
04:52:34.150 --> 04:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
think that going back and forth
 
04:52:35.910 --> 04:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
with multiple
 
04:52:38.070 --> 04:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
amendments and nobody's really clear on
 
04:52:40.230 --> 04:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
what the amendments are it's not living
 
04:52:42.470 --> 04:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
up to our responsibility as a committee
 
04:52:44.628 --> 04:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
and that's just my view so thank you for
 
04:52:44.638 --> 04:52:45.750 align:start position:0%
and that's just my view so thank you for
listening

04:52:45.750 --> 04:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
listening
 
04:52:47.510 --> 04:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for that input
 
04:52:48.788 --> 04:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald and
 
04:52:51.670 --> 04:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:55.430 --> 04:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
i'd like to make a motion to itl
 
04:52:55.440 --> 04:52:56.948 align:start position:0%
i'd like to make a motion to itl
1184.

04:52:56.948 --> 04:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
1184.
 
04:52:58.868 --> 04:52:58.878 align:start position:0%
second second we all second i didn't
 
04:53:01.590 --> 04:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
hear what you said 12 seconds
 
04:53:06.230 --> 04:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me a motion to itl 1184.
 
04:53:07.670 --> 04:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
been made in second
 
04:53:10.628 --> 04:53:10.638 align:start position:0%
discussion representative tripp
 
04:53:12.310 --> 04:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
i think this is probably the wisest
 
04:53:14.628 --> 04:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
thing to do because
 
04:53:17.670 --> 04:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
if we was to otp it we would be relying
 
04:53:21.030 --> 04:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
on something happening at ols which
 
04:53:22.708 --> 04:53:22.718 align:start position:0%
apparently isn't uh
 
04:53:24.550 --> 04:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
something that uh
 
04:53:26.868 --> 04:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
it works all the time so i think i
 
04:53:29.110 --> 04:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
telling it uh
 
04:53:29.120 --> 04:53:30.070 align:start position:0%
telling it uh
makes

04:53:30.070 --> 04:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
makes
 
04:53:32.788 --> 04:53:32.798 align:start position:0%
makes it uh
 
04:53:34.788 --> 04:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
i think the bot the bill is flawed right
 
04:53:34.798 --> 04:53:35.670 align:start position:0%
i think the bot the bill is flawed right
now

04:53:35.670 --> 04:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:53:38.708 --> 04:53:38.718 align:start position:0%
and i think to otp it would be a mistake
 
04:53:42.948 --> 04:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
so if we itl it uh and we get a
 
04:53:45.910 --> 04:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
an amendment that's good if we itl it
 
04:53:48.150 --> 04:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
and we don't get an amendment that's
 
04:53:49.430 --> 04:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
good too
 
04:53:50.948 --> 04:53:50.958 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
04:53:52.550 --> 04:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
amendment is that what you mean either
 
04:53:52.560 --> 04:53:53.670 align:start position:0%
amendment is that what you mean either
or

04:53:53.670 --> 04:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:53:55.670 --> 04:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know but uh but i don't think that
 
04:53:58.708 --> 04:53:58.718 align:start position:0%
we should move a flawed bill forward
 
04:53:58.718 --> 04:54:01.030 align:start position:0%
we should move a flawed bill forward
okay

04:54:01.030 --> 04:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:02.550 --> 04:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
okay i don't want to stack the deck but
 
04:54:03.830 --> 04:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
04:54:06.150 --> 04:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
we'd have to do this if we're going to
 
04:54:09.030 --> 04:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
itl it and wait for a new amendment to
 
04:54:11.670 --> 04:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
come through we have to have
 
04:54:13.190 --> 04:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
some little uh
 
04:54:15.030 --> 04:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
secret handshake that we're going to
 
04:54:15.040 --> 04:54:16.628 align:start position:0%
secret handshake that we're going to
support

04:54:16.628 --> 04:54:16.638 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:54:19.590 --> 04:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
an on the floor amendment
 
04:54:21.270 --> 04:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:54:23.190 --> 04:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
i agree with representative tripp i
 
04:54:24.948 --> 04:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
think we should dispose of this as
 
04:54:27.350 --> 04:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative stavis has said
 
04:54:30.868 --> 04:54:30.878 align:start position:0%
my preference is itl um and then if the
 
04:54:32.788 --> 04:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
sponsor at that time decides that they
 
04:54:34.868 --> 04:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
want to come forward with the amendment
 
04:54:37.190 --> 04:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
and work the floor to get it overturned
 
04:54:39.270 --> 04:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
to not to pass we should leave it to
 
04:54:41.350 --> 04:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
them but right now it is in our hand and
 
04:54:42.868 --> 04:54:42.878 align:start position:0%
we should put through
 
04:54:44.470 --> 04:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
the best bill we can
 
04:54:45.990 --> 04:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
at this point we can't change it so i
 
04:54:48.470 --> 04:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
think we should i tell you
 
04:54:50.390 --> 04:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
we have a uh
 
04:54:52.230 --> 04:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
a motion to itl
 
04:54:54.230 --> 04:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
and we have it uh
 
04:54:56.830 --> 04:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
also seconded yes i was just gonna
 
04:55:01.990 --> 04:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:05.430 --> 04:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
mr chair i'll i'll just uh give everyone
 
04:55:07.830 --> 04:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
a heads up that i i will i'm going to
