and welcome to Transportation
 
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
committee's I believe final meeting of
 
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
the banum um just to deal with our
 
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
interim study bills before we get
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
started uh representative Koker would
 
00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
allegiance to the flag of the United
 
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
States of America to the Republic for
 
00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
which it stand
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
one na God indivisible liy and justice
 
00:15:04.079 --> 00:15:11.790 align:start position:0%
one na God indivisible liy and justice
for

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
all all right just briefly what we're
 
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959 align:start position:0%
doing today uh for those of you that may
 
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
not have gone through this process uh
 
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
for any number of reasons we decided to
 
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
interim study these bills uh when they
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
were brought before us at least one of
 
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
them was actually a retain bill from the
 
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
first here and when we decided what to
 
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
do with that in January we still didn't
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
know what to do so we interum studied
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
that one as well the only two motions
 
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at today are whether
 
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
or not to recommend future legislation
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
or not and so we I we'll go through them
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
one at a time um we'll open them up for
 
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
discussion but at the end of the day uh
 
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
those are the only two motions we're
 
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
we're we're looking for and it's in
 
00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
hopes that it'll save time next year uh
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
when anybody's filing a bill whether or
 
00:16:00.749 --> 00:16:00.759 align:start position:0%
not where the transportation committee
 
00:16:06.309 --> 00:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
already stands so that being said
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh the first bill will take up thank you
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative St Clair um House Bill 55
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
relative to driver
 
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
education uh is there a
 
00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:23.870 align:start position:0%
education uh is there a
motion

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
actually I see representative
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
Koker thank you Mr chairman I would make
 
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
a motion to uh recommend for further
 
00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
legislation I just think that uh the
 
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
direction we've been going is hold on
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
hold on so the motion is to recommend
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
future legislation can I have a second
 
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
second by representative Hill would you
 
00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
care to speak to your motion I know
 
00:16:45.069 --> 00:16:45.079 align:start position:0%
we're all a little bit Rusty here it
 
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't take long I'm not that smart um
 
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
anyways so um I think that uh it
 
00:16:52.829 --> 00:16:52.839 align:start position:0%
integrating the parents into children's
 
00:16:54.509 --> 00:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
uh driver's education is important I
 
00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:55.959 align:start position:0%
think it's something that we should look
 
00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
into um obviously we ran into some
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
issues this year with how to like how
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
big of a role and you know how basically
 
00:17:05.309 --> 00:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
how to check that the parents are
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
actually doing what they need to do but
 
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
I think that um I think that further um
 
00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:14.919 align:start position:0%
legislation and um some further talks
 
00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:17.959 align:start position:0%
about how we can integrate parents into
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
driver's education and keep it um safe
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
for the DMV is something that we should
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh look into so that's that's what I
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
believe thank you sir anybody else from
 
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
representative pondon thank you Mr chair
 
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
um I can support the further legislation
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
but I want to bring out another concern
 
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
that I have is just assuming that the
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
parents are good drivers and know the
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
laws of the road I think if you if we go
 
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:51.640 align:start position:0%
out and we test say a 100 drivers that
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
have been on a road for 10
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
years I would be willing to bet that 80%
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
of them don't know the basic like
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
parking 25 ft to corner or 15 ft from
 
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
hydrant all those basic things that a
 
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
new driver really really needs to know
 
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
so I would support further legislation
 
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:11.480 align:start position:0%
but just ahead of time I want to see
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
something of more of an onus on the
 
00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:16.919 align:start position:0%
parent and also uh
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
documentation that would be provided to
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh the DMV maybe a certified document
 
00:18:24.909 --> 00:18:24.919 align:start position:0%
saying stating that the parent did in
 
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
fact drive with the student the 18y old
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
so many hours just something
 
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
U holding them accountable but I would
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
support it but I think we need
 
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
definitely need more time and study on
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
this thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
SES thank you Mr chairman um I'm
 
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat in agreement with my colleague
 
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
at uh representative
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
panden um the way I would look at at it
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
when on the current system we have
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
professionals who are teaching people
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
how to
 
00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
drive and that's an important component
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
of their their abilities to drive well
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
and be safe uh and that's something
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
every parent and every citizen I hope is
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
always trying to keep people safe um the
 
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
problem that I see in having just the
 
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.230 align:start position:0%
problem that I see in having just the
parents

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
as part of the system uh with a track
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
that allows them to do that is that they
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
may not be in fact professionals and
 
00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
so maybe as if if this bill is
 
00:19:45.149 --> 00:19:45.159 align:start position:0%
recommended for future consideration
 
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
that one of the cons important
 
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
considerations should be that parents
 
00:19:55.149 --> 00:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
have what I would might uh finally call
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
continuing education to make sure that
 
00:19:59.310 --> 00:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
they're up to dat with the with the
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
types of vehicles that are now being
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
sold with the rules of the road that are
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
now under as we all know under a state
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
of conflict
 
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
U uh change all the time and so you know
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
that that is my concern um I I think the
 
00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
bill as written um I can't support the
 
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
are representative Horan aren't you a
 
00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.149 align:start position:0%
are representative Horan aren't you a
subtit

00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
subtit
 
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
Hill thank you Mr chair so
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
um I know uh what um what George is
 
00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:42.200 align:start position:0%
talking about is true that we do want
 
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
safe roads but we are talking only about
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
ages 16 to 18 because at 18 um all bets
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
are off there's no requirement for
 
00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
driver red so it is um it is really
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
talking about those two years and if um
 
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
if we were truly interested in the
 
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
safety of the roads we would be
 
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
requiring the driver red regardless of
 
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
the age so um I'm not really sure uh
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
well um there's another bill George um
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
you know but uh but for right now as it
 
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:19.240 align:start position:0%
stands um I I will uh agree with
 
00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:21.799 align:start position:0%
representative Coker and um and follow
 
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
the recommendation for future
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
legislation and future
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Morgan
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
sure I'm just sub here I'm just a guest
 
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
just a very quick word smithing in the
 
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
event that someone uh someone around the
 
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
table wants to bring the bill back uh
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
you know in the next filing period the
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh wording they use the pH father mother
 
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:47.240 align:start position:0%
or Guardian twice or and then parent or
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
Guardian I think twice so it should be
 
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh first of all I think parent or
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
Guardian is a more inclusive phrase it's
 
00:21:54.669 --> 00:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
probably better but in any event you
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
probably don't want to use two two
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
different phrases when you ask oh L to
 
00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
write up a new version of this and
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
probably you know parents better that's
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
just not really a substan of comment
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
it's just a stylistic thing so yeah so
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
that anybody else no shut up
 
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
thank represent I saw representative
 
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.549 align:start position:0%
thank represent I saw representative
sellers

00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
sellers
 
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
first thank you Mr chair so my only
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
thought and coming from a different
 
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
angle on this
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
is the less fortunate that don't have
 
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
the money to pay for driver's ed in
 
00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
which this case they'll at least have
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
another option to be able to get their
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
license before they're 18 so that's why
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at this as
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
recommended represent represent rbo
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you uh the one thing that held me
 
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:43.480 align:start position:0%
back class or one of the things that
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
held me back when we discussed this
 
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:46.360 align:start position:0%
earlier was the other another
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
responsible adult uh language included
 
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
in addition to parents and Guardians so
 
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
just mentioning that to the extent this
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
does get brought forward next time um I
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
feel like that's pretty Broad and we
 
00:22:58.029 --> 00:22:58.039 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about it could just
 
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
be 18-year-old friend and whether we
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
would feel comfortable with that as
 
00:23:02.669 --> 00:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
somebody who could take on this
 
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility um I would like to see
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
that perhaps not included in the future
 
00:23:11.269 --> 00:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559 align:start position:0%
forward representative St Clair thank
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
you um I'd be I would Echo all these
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
concerns except there's a test that's
 
00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
administered by the state and if we
 
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
don't think the test is strong enough to
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
catch anybody that doesn't know all the
 
00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
rules and what they need to know then
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
maybe it's a test we should be looking
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
you okay I we're we're on the on the the
 
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
course of rewriting the bill here but
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
um anybody
 
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
else I'll chime in I think this is a
 
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
horrible idea I always have this is the
 
00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
second ter we've actually seen this bill
 
00:23:54.909 --> 00:23:54.919 align:start position:0%
uh we are talking about driver Zed for
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
our kids 16 and 17 years old and I think
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
the system we have works the only reason
 
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
I supported interim study on this versus
 
00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.510 align:start position:0%
I supported interim study on this versus
an

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
itl uh was that I also do recognize that
 
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
we do need to do something about the
 
00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
affordability and availability of driver
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
at it never used to be a problem when
 
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
the schools offered it uh why they don't
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
now is been brought up in discussion I
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
haven't got an answer uh but it makes no
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
sense to me if they still did offer it I
 
00:24:24.269 --> 00:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
don't think we'd be having the
 
00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
discussion on this bill at all right now
 
00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:29.919 align:start position:0%
uh but because we did recognize the fact
 
00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
that affordability and availability is
 
00:24:34.269 --> 00:24:34.279 align:start position:0%
an issue I figured we'd wait and see
 
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
before we decided on this uh what the
 
00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles has
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
actually been working on to alleviate
 
00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
those issues uh I don't know if you'd
 
00:24:45.149 --> 00:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
like to chime in on some of his recent
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
progress I'm not throwing you into the
 
00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:51.039 align:start position:0%
bus but um if you don't mind if what
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
have we been doing towards the goal of
 
00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh availability and
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
affordability um that you've been
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman members of the
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for the opportunity
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
to um to highlight some of the work we
 
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
have been doing and um really enjoy
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
listening to the conversation about
 
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
driver's ed and um how we can move the
 
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
ball forward uh on that front uh one of
 
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
the things that we've been working on is
 
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
uh the affordability part so we
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
understand that um driver's education
 
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
today can be anywhere from $800 to
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
$1,000 that's a lot of money for young
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
people um so in working with the uh New
 
00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Automobile Dealers Association
 
00:25:35.549 --> 00:25:35.559 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Commission on human
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
rights and um the New Hampshire drivers
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
education Teachers Association uh we
 
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
have uh stood up a scholarship program
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
um nhada runs the program all the
 
00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
finances go through nhada the
 
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
application lives on their website Dan
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
Bennett has been an amazing partner and
 
00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
um we just rolled that out within the
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
last couple of months the applications
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh are coming in fast and Furious We
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
were fortunate to receive a
 
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
$225,000 donation from the um exitor New
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
Car Dealers Association and uh that was
 
00:26:09.909 --> 00:26:09.919 align:start position:0%
about a month month and a half ago um
 
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
and that allows for about 50
 
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
scholarships but we're going to go
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
through that money pretty quickly um and
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh we've given out if I had to guess
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
we've probably given out at least um 18
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
or more than 20 scholarships so far so
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
if there was a way to continue funding
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
that we're doing it through private
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
donations uh we're trying to get the
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
word out but um certainly would love to
 
00:26:32.389 --> 00:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
work with this body on some strategies
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
to um maybe have a pool of money that
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
either that scholarship could draw from
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
or another alternative where you had a
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
private public partnership in trying to
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
fund uh driver's ed for uh for young
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
people but the need is there um the
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
other thing we did was we worked with um
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
Employment Security and uh Deputy
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Rich labors commissioner
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
kadus I I'd like to thank him uh there's
 
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
a program there where you uh if you're a
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
qualifying employer can reduce the cost
 
00:27:05.549 --> 00:27:05.559 align:start position:0%
um to go to school by 50% for certain
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities it fit with driver ed and
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
we just had Deputy Commissioner labers
 
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
at our monthly driver ed meeting uh last
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
month and he talked about the program
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
basically what that allows for if it's
 
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
$4,000 to go through the 12we program 12
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
to 15we program to get your driver's
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
education certificate from White
 
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:26.440 align:start position:0%
Mountain Community College uh you as an
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
employer hiring that instructor uh will
 
00:27:31.389 --> 00:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
be in reimburse for 50% of that so that
 
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799 align:start position:0%
opens up more opportunities for
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
instructors to come through which means
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
that that cuts down on the demand and we
 
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:38.200 align:start position:0%
have more uh opportunities
 
00:27:39.549 --> 00:27:39.559 align:start position:0%
geographically around the state for
 
00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
people to take drivers head um the way
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
it was explained uh Deputy lers has did
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
an awesome job uh basically what what
 
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
happens is you can do that once a year
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
apply for it up front it's like
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
Insurance you name the dollar amount and
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
the hiring you think you're going to do
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
and if you hire somebody you can use
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
that opportunity to offset the cost um
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
the other thing is I get a um uh a
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
monthly update on weight times around
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
the state um the state police uh who
 
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
currently uh well actually as of um
 
00:28:09.549 --> 00:28:09.559 align:start position:0%
about a week and a half ago it's
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
switched now the DMV we have a full-time
 
00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
position that oversees driver's ed
 
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
that's the first time in a long time the
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
DMV has overseen the program um that
 
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
gentleman uh Sam Bon started recently uh
 
00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
he comes from the driver ed Community he
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
owned his own school um he's running the
 
00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:27.799 align:start position:0%
program now but the state police have
 
00:28:30.029 --> 00:28:30.039 align:start position:0%
been giving updates on the wait times
 
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
and there really aren't any for the most
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
part you're able to get right in that's
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
what I'm getting and I asked for uh a
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
sampling from each County around the
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
state on that so I guess I would step
 
00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039 align:start position:0%
away saying or take any questions wait
 
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
times are way down people are able to
 
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
access driver ed we have something in
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
place to try to offset the financial
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
need and we're trying to bring more
 
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
instructors in thanks to Employment
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
Security and the other response I got on
 
00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
that was we're doing really well on
 
00:28:58.389 --> 00:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
instructors people are coming in in
 
00:29:00.509 --> 00:29:00.519 align:start position:0%
droves and uh schools are able to stand
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
up and operate their program so uh to
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
the chair's Point driver's education I
 
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
think in comparison to two years ago is
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
in a really good place um but there's
 
00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
always room to support the industry and
 
00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
for improvement so happy to take any
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
questions um just one quick one for me
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
has there been any further discussion
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Education on
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
possibly returning this to the schools
 
00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
we did do that sir um we did that
 
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
probably over over a year ago um with um
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
Mr applebe um I've spoken with Diana
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
Fenton uh we we've I've asked those
 
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
questions because I've also had um
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
presentations on areas around the state
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
where that model still exists it it
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
exists in nsha um I drove by I think it
 
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
was nasua North High School and um and I
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
saw driver ed Vehicles out and back at
 
00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
one point so I I inquired about that and
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
they the city of nashille runs a program
 
00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:55.240 align:start position:0%
where the school is part of it so there
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
there are I think five different
 
00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:58.039 align:start position:0%
districts around the state that still
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
still have that model that exists um
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
other states use that model my
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
understanding is when we had that model
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh we had no issues uh
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
it ran very smoothly I in speaking with
 
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:11.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed I know that their
 
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
curriculum is very tight uh there isn't
 
00:30:15.789 --> 00:30:15.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of flexibility or wiggle room
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
there to bring in other programs because
 
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
of some of the things that they have to
 
00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:22.039 align:start position:0%
offer um that being said that driver
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
training fund um that is still on the
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
books that's that's covered by an RSA
 
00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
that was where the funding came in to
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
allow for uh drivers had the cost to be
 
00:30:34.269 --> 00:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
offset if we could ever get back to that
 
00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:35.559 align:start position:0%
relationship I think that would be a
 
00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
good thing because it
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
work thank you sir U representative Phil
 
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
got a question quickly yeah um thank you
 
00:30:45.149 --> 00:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
for taking our questions um have you
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
ever talked with uh the um the insurance
 
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
department um specifically commissioner
 
00:30:54.909 --> 00:30:54.919 align:start position:0%
Von Court about uh the idea of whether
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
if a school department does have that or
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
if there was widespread driver red
 
00:31:02.509 --> 00:31:02.519 align:start position:0%
whether that would be um part of
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
lowering um Insurance costs for the
 
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
community um I didn't know if that would
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
be a selling point for a school
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
department for having it I think that's
 
00:31:14.629 --> 00:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
a great idea I have not done that and um
 
00:31:16.269 --> 00:31:16.279 align:start position:0%

Mr chairman um
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
with this particular bill um I am a I
 
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
have no problem and we worked as a
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
committee to make some small adjustments
 
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
to the inspection program that could
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
help the citizens of New Hampshire I
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
have no problem with tweaks but this is
 
00:38:13.599 --> 00:38:14.349 align:start position:0%
have no problem with tweaks but this is
to

00:38:14.349 --> 00:38:14.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
eliminate and you know I think that's a
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
little bridge too far for me I think um
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
the inspection program does serve its
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
purpose and to eliminate it um I think
 
00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
is not a wise decision that's why on
 
00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:30.680 align:start position:0%

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%

collect findes and do
 
00:41:34.829 --> 00:41:34.839 align:start position:0%
other uh issues with other in different
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
cases of the law and also the DMV has
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
explained that this is the very last
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
step that there are other things that
 
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
are done when they are notified that
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
license thank you sir anybody else in
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
the committee representative
 
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
SE yeah so we've we have been trying as
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
a committee in the past to try and um
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
remove uh fines that uh are not tied
 
00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
that that are imposed where there's no
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
connection to driving privileges and
 
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
while this bill as it's currently
 
00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
written may have um some issues that
 
00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
could be corrected I think that the the
 
00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:31.640 align:start position:0%
process or the the hope to make sure
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
that we are
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
um not adding fines that would and the
 
00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:41.720 align:start position:0%
you know to non-driver related causes
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
that cause a person to lose their
 
00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:45.640 align:start position:0%
driving privileges and their ability to
 
00:42:47.549 --> 00:42:47.559 align:start position:0%
work and their ability to
 
00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
take uh kids to school and their ability
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
to get to the doctors Etc I think is um
 
00:42:58.349 --> 00:42:58.359 align:start position:0%
a laudable goal and I look at this as
 
00:42:59.790 --> 00:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
this is a goal that we should be
 
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
striving for as opposed to
 
00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:07.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily um not by giving up on the
 
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
idea that was a that was a good one that
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
that should uh be followed through in my
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
opinion anybody else from the
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
committee wow we get all the time we
 
00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:23.319 align:start position:0%
spent on 55 and look at this uh I'll
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
chime in myself I B 650 since day one
 
00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
and I think this is the second term
 
00:43:29.549 --> 00:43:29.559 align:start position:0%
we've seen this as well I was on the
 
00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:31.720 align:start position:0%
fence I can see the merits of it on both
 
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
sides um but after the last hearing on
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
this knowing that it's the absolute last
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
thing that the Department of Motor
 
00:43:41.549 --> 00:43:41.559 align:start position:0%
Vehicle does I look at it a little bit
 
00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:43.240 align:start position:0%
different I'm also a little concerned
 
00:43:45.549 --> 00:43:45.559 align:start position:0%
that it seems every time we try to
 
00:43:47.549 --> 00:43:47.559 align:start position:0%
reduce the ways people are responsible
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
for breaking the laws the worst things
 
00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
get U bail reform comes to mind uh
 
00:43:55.349 --> 00:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
because of it's the last resort and
 
00:43:57.390 --> 00:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
because we need teeth in law some where
 
00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
to get people to comply with their
 
00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
decisions or the decisions made I don't
 
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
think this is a good idea to pursue at
 
00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
this time uh so I will be voting to not
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
recommend that being said um I'll ask
 
00:44:12.549 --> 00:44:12.559 align:start position:0%

protection of personal information and
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses chair recognizes
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative Gorski for a motion thank
 
00:47:45.309 --> 00:47:45.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh my motion is uh to
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
recommend future legislation on
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
1273 uh motions to recommend any do I
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
have a second representative sers
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
seconds care to speak to your motion sir
 
00:47:59.910 --> 00:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
I do thank you um when we heard this
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
bill one of the things that um struck me
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
is I I I reflected on the establishments
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
that I go to and um them asking to take
 
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
my license and to scan it and for no
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
apparent reason valid but I don't know
 
00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
what they're doing with my information
 
00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
and I think more and more establishments
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
are doing that I'm more concerned with
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
what they're doing with our personal
 
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
information and I think this is a bill
 
00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:29.839 align:start position:0%
worth looking into in the future to
 
00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
maybe tighten it a little bit um so that
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
you know there's some privacy issues
 
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
that can be taken a look
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
at thank you sir anybody else from the
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
committee no seeing I will repres sorry
 
00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
a little slow on the uptake this morning
 
00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:52.030 align:start position:0%
a little slow on the uptake this morning
um

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
so I I I'm just I have problems with the
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
bill as it is written
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
um uh again though we have uh and so I
 
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
can't you know support the motion to
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
move it forward um I think there are
 
00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
some real issues that we have that have
 
00:49:12.309 --> 00:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
to be dealt with but I think it has to
 
00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
be I think a fresh look would be better
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
than working on an old piece of
 
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
legislation that
 
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
has so many in my mind inherent flaw
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
and so for that reason I can't support
 
00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:31.230 align:start position:0%
and so for that reason I can't support
the

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:31.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
motion yeah and our motion doesn't
 
00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
reflect that we're going to necessarily
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
take this one and move it forward it's
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
the concept that I'm looking at I do
 
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
agree um that we should be taking a look
 
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
and preserving our we're protecting our
 
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
information uh I do agree there were a
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
lot of challenges with the bill that we
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
had before us but in concept I think we
 
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
should uh we should look at it again uh
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
I know that one section in particular um
 
00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
just so you know in the work I did with
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
this I've never I've never had more
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
lobbyists in this building approach me
 
00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
than on this bill it was actually
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
terrifying um and one of the biggest
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
things was uh the fines for example that
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
are proposed to be um issued if people
 
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
don't destroy the information so yes I I
 
00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:19.240 align:start position:0%
agree that the particular bill has its
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
problems but I also think it's something
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
we should look at and that's why I'm
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
going to recommend future a piece of
 
00:50:27.789 --> 00:50:27.799 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh represent of
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
London thank you Mr chair I I uh just
 
00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
have to concur I I have a lot of uh
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
concerns with the way this legislation
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
is written I personally think we need
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
new legislation drafted specifically to
 
00:50:46.829 --> 00:50:46.839 align:start position:0%
the usage of data after it's it's its
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
input we heard testimony regarding uh
 
00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
weal from State one one of our
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
colleagues State Rep how there was an
 
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
insurance agent how it affects chiral
 
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh airplane tickets hotels all types of
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
insurance uh the need for titles and
 
00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
lending um as you stated Mr chair there
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
was a lot of testimony uh we had it from
 
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
the uh New England connectivity and
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
telecomunications business the New
 
00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire business and industry New
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Grocers and many others that
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
were opposed to this I think a fresh
 
00:51:22.829 --> 00:51:22.839 align:start position:0%
start is what we need to go at so at
 
00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
this time although I understand the
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
intent I think we need something new and
 
00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:29.240 align:start position:0%
fresh coming in specific to what we're
 
00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:32.599 align:start position:0%
looking for thank you Mr
 
00:51:35.109 --> 00:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
chair fair enough anybody else from the
 
00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
committee and again I'm just voting for
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
the concept I would suspect any new
 
00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation legislation will
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
start with a blank sheet of RSA
 
00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
2614 uh and away we go so uh with nobody
 
00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:50.599 align:start position:0%

I'll representative fo seconds care to
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yeah just briefly
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
um I I really I recall there being just
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
some philosophical differences on on the
 
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
need for this bill or not I in my
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
opinion and based on some of the
 
00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard um it it just
 
00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
actually makes it cleaner the state
 
00:54:55.829 --> 00:54:55.839 align:start position:0%
police testify that you know a move over
 
00:54:55.839 --> 00:54:57.030 align:start position:0%
police testify that you know a move over
l

00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
l
 
00:54:58.750 --> 00:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
any vehicles on the side of the road uh
 
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
not distinguishing between emergency
 
00:55:02.589 --> 00:55:02.599 align:start position:0%
vehicle versus disabled vehicle um I
 
00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
think it makes it easier and clearer for
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
drivers um and and would put into statue
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
what it's best
 
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
practice anybody else from the committee
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
thank you by the
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
way representative Koger thank you Mr
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
chairman I just uh the same opinion I
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
had on this you can't legislate Common
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
Sense than you
 
00:55:29.309 --> 00:55:29.319 align:start position:0%
anybody else represents
 
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
sees so um it's my opinion that um
 
00:55:38.109 --> 00:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes people can accept a little
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
guidance about how things might be
 
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
better done and um the list of uh
 
00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:49.960 align:start position:0%
agencies and um private and public that
 
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
are in support of this bill was pretty
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
overwhelming and I I think that they've
 
00:55:57.789 --> 00:55:57.799 align:start position:0%
studied this issue to realize that uh
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
that it will make a difference and it'll
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
help protect people on the highways more
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
so than
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
not representative Hill thank you um
 
00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.549 align:start position:0%
not representative Hill thank you um
just

00:56:09.549 --> 00:56:09.559 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh there was a there was a a
 
00:56:15.069 --> 00:56:15.079 align:start position:0%
car on the side of the road and someone
 
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
decided that they needed to move over um
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
without looking whether I was there or
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
not um so I this some of this scares the
 
00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
Dickens out of me when it uh when it
 
00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
says move over and I understand when it
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
is uh um flashing yellow green or or red
 
00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
lights but this was pushing uh for
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
anyone off to the side of the road and
 
00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
that um made it difficult for me I mean
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
you oftentimes you don't know if you're
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
driving if you're in the passing Lane
 
00:56:56.029 --> 00:56:56.039 align:start position:0%
you cannot see that car and not be able
 
00:56:59.069 --> 00:56:59.079 align:start position:0%
to to anticipate that person in the in
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
the traveling Lane coming over um for
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
whatever reason and that was the part
 
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:07.640 align:start position:0%
that worried me um so I'm not sure
 
00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
I again whether this is recommended or
 
00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
not recommended I don't think it's going
 
00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
to stop anybody from putting in a bill
 
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
or not putting in a bill so I'm
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
perfectly happy to go either way on this
 
00:57:23.309 --> 00:57:23.319 align:start position:0%
but it uh it for me um it's a hard thing
 
00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:27.400 align:start position:0%
to make it a um a mandatory thing across
 
00:57:29.069 --> 00:57:29.079 align:start position:0%
the board
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
thanks anybody
 
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
else George thinks he's getting the last
 
00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:36.029 align:start position:0%
else George thinks he's getting the last
work

00:57:36.029 --> 00:57:36.039 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
represent I I might be I don't know um
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
so I I think some one of the testimonies
 
00:57:46.589 --> 00:57:46.599 align:start position:0%
that I was uh most mindful of was from
 
00:57:49.109 --> 00:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
the triaa um and they they were pretty
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
elaborate about their support for this
 
00:57:54.829 --> 00:57:54.839 align:start position:0%
um I would also make note that while we
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
can we shouldn't make legislation based
 
00:57:58.559 --> 00:57:59.630 align:start position:0%
can we shouldn't make legislation based
on

00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
anecdotal uh points but rather we should
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
be looking at the data and then the
 
00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
final point that I would make that
 
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
hasn't been brought up today but I would
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
mention and and maybe wasn't brought up
 
00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
in committee um was that um more and
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
more cars of a newer age are putting
 
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
Lane protection and they're warning
 
00:58:28.789 --> 00:58:28.799 align:start position:0%
people about the size now is it perfect
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
no no system is perfect but I think when
 
00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
you balance improving Tech remember we
 
00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
when we when we're looking at safety
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get to education
 
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:42.799 align:start position:0%
technology and um
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement and I think that those on
 
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
those fronts we are making enough
 
00:58:49.549 --> 00:58:49.559 align:start position:0%
progress to justify the uh
 
00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:56.589 --> 00:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
forward representative Rumble at risk of
 
00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
trying to sound like I'm trying to have
 
00:58:59.870 --> 00:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
the last word here I just I did want to
 
00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:01.240 align:start position:0%
mention terms of recommending or not
 
00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
there is language in there about if
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
practical I recognizing that people are
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
not necessar going to be able to get
 
00:59:09.029 --> 00:59:09.039 align:start position:0%
over in all instances this that's all
 
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
I'll argue about for
 
00:59:13.789 --> 00:59:13.799 align:start position:0%
now representative St
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
Clair thanks and uh if practical is a
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
pretty big hole because now you become
 
00:59:22.589 --> 00:59:22.599 align:start position:0%
you become the Observer of the person to
 
00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
see if what they did was practical or
 
00:59:29.069 --> 00:59:29.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
paraphrase representative Hill I'm not
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
I'm terrified now when I see cars pulled
 
00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
over to they may be relieving themselves
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
switching drivers taking a break because
 
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
now if this goes into effect I got to
 
00:59:43.549 --> 00:59:43.559 align:start position:0%
watch out for a kneejerk reaction from
 
00:59:45.069 --> 00:59:45.079 align:start position:0%
somebody that all of a sudden oh my God
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
and then because there were no warning
 
00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
lights to give them notice as they
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
approach um it it's it's a real throw of
 
00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
the dice um I just want people to think
 
00:59:59.470 --> 00:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
about that thank you anybody
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
else represent sellers thank you Mr
 
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
chair my only thought is that you know
 
01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
trying to keep a standard throughout the
 
01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:07.559 align:start position:0%
United States I know we're only New
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but Most states have uh the uh
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
red blue and yellow lights and if you
 
01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
start doing everybody especially we're a
 
01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:19.799 align:start position:0%
vacation state from people coming from
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
how to state they're going to be very
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
all right representative
 
01:00:33.549 --> 01:00:33.559 align:start position:0%
Smith um so the the language in this a
 
01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:37.160 align:start position:0%
disabled vehicle meaning a vehicle that
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
is in a traffic lane or on the side of a
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
traffic lane that a reasonable person
 
01:00:44.829 --> 01:00:44.839 align:start position:0%
would conclude is
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
disabled how am I supposed to know if
 
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
it's disabled or they pulled over to
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
answer their phone do do I have to try
 
01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
to look through the back window to
 
01:00:56.430 --> 01:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
decide if I should move over or not I
 
01:00:59.470 --> 01:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
mean the idea might be okay but if I can
 
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
get a ticket for this I don't think the
 
01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.470 align:start position:0%
get a ticket for this I don't think the
language

01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
Works anybody
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
else I have to agree with a lot of the
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
points that were mentioned this in my
 
01:01:13.029 --> 01:01:13.039 align:start position:0%
opinion while I agree with the Move Over
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
Law is just another piece of legislation
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
trying to legislate common sense um when
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
you double that with the enforceability
 
01:01:24.589 --> 01:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
of it I don't see how or why this is
 
01:01:27.069 --> 01:01:27.079 align:start position:0%
necessary I would prefer to see a topic
 
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
like this reinforced in driver education
 
01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.230 align:start position:0%
like this reinforced in driver education
for

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
example with nothing else
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
said I'll ask the clerk to call the rule

motion representative SES
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
are you disappointed I don't have one in
 
01:07:27.839 --> 01:07:30.829 align:start position:0%
are you disappointed I don't have one in
the

01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.589 --> 01:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
gate um my motion would be to recommend
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh future
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
legislation motion is to recommend
 
01:07:40.269 --> 01:07:40.279 align:start position:0%
future legislation is there a second
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
second second by representative V you
 
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
um I think that this this was this was a
 
01:07:57.870 --> 01:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
good faith B part effort in the Senate
 
01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:01.799 align:start position:0%
to um fix a a unnown
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
problem um
 
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
both Republican and Democratic senators
 
01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
voted in favor of this bill it uh as I
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
recall the Department of Motor Vehicles
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
also testified in favor of this bill I I
 
01:08:20.349 --> 01:08:20.359 align:start position:0%
think that it um we should move forward
 
01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
with the with the with fixing a problem
 
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
that our constituents are fac
 
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
and for that reason I would urge my
 
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
colleagues to recommend future
 
01:08:33.390 --> 01:08:33.400 align:start position:0%
legislation for
 
01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
this anybody else from the committee
 
01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:37.870 align:start position:0%
this anybody else from the committee
representative

01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
V thank you Mr chairman um this this
 
01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
bill just fixes a a kind of a flaw in
 
01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
the the uh license renewal process we
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
can renew online but um you can't print
 
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
your your receipt showing that you that
 
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
you did renew and have that as a valid
 
01:08:59.910 --> 01:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
um evidence of of renewal right now you
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
can print it and you can present it to
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
an officer but there's no legal oppos
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
obligation for that officer to accept it
 
01:09:09.070 --> 01:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
so um you you would run the risk of
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
having to prove that you're that you've
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh renewed your license in other ways or
 
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
or be fined for operating the expired
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
license um I think where we got caught
 
01:09:23.669 --> 01:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
up as a committee was uh on the the part
 
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
that says that it's not valid for voting
 
01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:31.719 align:start position:0%
and um I think uh if you look at RSA
 
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
65913 it allows for an expired license
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
to be used as uh proof of ID for voting
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
so um and the the language that's in the
 
01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
the bill is also already in the law so
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
um if we need to change that then I
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
think something we need to recommend
 
01:09:53.070 --> 01:09:53.080 align:start position:0%
down the road but I would support fixing
 
01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
that flaw or that that administrative of
 
01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
legislation represent Gori thank you Mr
 
01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:05.950 align:start position:0%
legislation represent Gori thank you Mr
chairman

01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
um when I reread this bill and I
 
01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
testimony about half of it I have no
 
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
problem with the one I have a problem
 
01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
with is literally in the beginning where
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
there's a line in here that states the
 
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
right of a non-resident to drive a
 
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle in this State while holding a
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
valid driver's
 
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
license issued by another
 
01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
state and to me the way I read this is
 
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
that we're going to provide someone a
 
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
license that's been given by another
 
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
state but we don't know what the other
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
state has done in terms of vetting that
 
01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
person so I have a problem with that
 
01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
particular section and that's kind of
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why I cannot
 
01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
recommend moving this for future
 
01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:57.070 align:start position:0%
recommend moving this for future
legislation

01:10:57.070 --> 01:10:57.080 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:58.470 align:start position:0%
legislation
anybody

01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
01:11:02.189 --> 01:11:02.199 align:start position:0%
else I'll just add this um I'm also not
 
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
in favor of this moving forward and I
 
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
will be supporting to not recommend and
 
01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
it's not just because of the problems
 
01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
with the bill it's the problems with the
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
whole Theory uh to begin with I think
 
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
the problem is deeper than that years
 
01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
ago you never needed to wait for your
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
new driver's license you got it before
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
you walked out of the building so now I
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
look at this te Technologies increasing
 
01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
and the security and and the protections
 
01:11:30.669 --> 01:11:30.679 align:start position:0%
of our information and our new fancy
 
01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
real IDs and stuff is for our own
 
01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
benefit but we're just going to give you
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
a piece of paper for now I mean none of
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
it makes any sense I think the problem
 
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
we have are are much greater no offense
 
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
um so why would I want to fix something
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
I think is broken inherently uh that's
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
why I'm going to be voting to not
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
recommend and have the conversation
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
about uh the rest of what I just
 
01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the
 
01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
future with nobody else I'll ask the
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role when she's ready
 
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
motion is to actually where am I at
 
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
motion's to recommend motions to
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
that rep Gorski no rep Smith no clerk
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
yes RIP plumon yes rep parshall yes
 
01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:51.550 --> 01:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
no 8
 
01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
n okay so the motion to recommend fails
 
01:12:56.430 --> 01:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
8 to9
 
01:12:58.189 --> 01:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
um we need a motion to complete our
 
01:12:59.790 --> 01:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
business for the
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
bium what represent Koger I recommend to
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
not uh recommend for further legislation
 
01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
all right motion to not recommend we
 
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
have a second for
 
01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
it represent sellers yeah did you care
 
01:13:14.629 --> 01:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
to speak to it or have we had enough
 
01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
discussion on it I like what you said
 
01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
discussiones so one of the things that I
 
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
see happening uh that is of concern to
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
me is that
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh technology is changing and the way
 
01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
that the general public deals with the
 
01:13:39.149 --> 01:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
government agencies is changing and if
 
01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
we if we want one of the things I've
 
01:13:43.629 --> 01:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
heard over and over and over and over
 
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
again from my colleagues is that if we
 
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
have a law it should represent what the
 
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
people are willing to support and here
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
we are trying to make it A A system that
 
01:13:57.199 --> 01:13:58.350 align:start position:0%
we are trying to make it A A system that
the

01:13:58.350 --> 01:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
public I believe would support and would
 
01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
be willing to would be happy to see and
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
yet we are tossing it away again and I I
 
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
just I I hope that um in the upcoming
 
01:14:14.669 --> 01:14:14.679 align:start position:0%
two-year session will'll be um have
 
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:19.280 align:start position:0%

01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
changing Technologies and the way our
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
