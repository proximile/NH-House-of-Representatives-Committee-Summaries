move or relocate those track ropes so

we do have a a plan and a desire to
 
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
either do an overhaul on the aerial
 
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
tramway or a replacement that would be
 
00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
off in the future 2023-24
 
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
and so the manufacturer and the state
 
00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
tramway board have recommended that we
 
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
complete this project again as we are in

the reason for this request is
 
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
that the projects at health and human
 
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
services have been completed and we're
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
now looking to do
 
00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 align:start position:0%
an installation of central air
 
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
conditioning on the lower level of the
 
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
state house as a security measure
 
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
there was an incident several years ago
 
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
where a window air conditioner was
 
00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
removed and someone was able to enter
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
the building through a window
 
00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 align:start position:0%
and we believe that installing the
 
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
central ac will render the building more
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
secure my basic question is who
 
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.310 align:start position:0%
secure my basic question is who
authorized

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 align:start position:0%

but
 
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
my basic question is is there a formal

approval of
 
00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 align:start position:0%

at this point
 
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what the committee wants to
 
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.189 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what the committee wants to
do

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
i personally have a problem with
 
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
authorizing projects that have not been
 
00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 align:start position:0%
vetted through the
 
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
legislative process in some fashion
 
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
whether it be a statutory
 
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
committee or
 
00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
the capital budget at least the
 
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
facilities committee should have been
 
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
involved with this
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what the committee wants to
 
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
do with this bill i know what i would
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
want to do with this item i know what i
 
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
senator hennessey
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so i do recognize
 
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
that there is a safety issue with this
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
because once you put the air
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
conditioning units in the windows are
 
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
not locked
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
and so somebody can easily get in from
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
the outside would you prefer that this
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
goes to another committee before coming
 
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
to this committee for approval
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
i would prefer that at least go to the
 
00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 align:start position:0%
facilities committee
 
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
for them to look at what it is what the
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
cost is
 
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
and where the money comes from rather
 
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
than just us going oh well the
 
00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner has
 
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
decided that we're going to start with
 
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
the 690 and then try to find the rest of
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
i think for that second question about
 
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
whether this is sufficient for the
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
project we could ask
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.430 align:start position:0%
about that
i

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879 align:start position:0%
personally think this is a good project
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
and i would support it
 
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
if it goes to
 
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.589 align:start position:0%
if it goes to
facilities

00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
fine but i hope that that is an
 
00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:15.110 align:start position:0%
fine but i hope that that is an
expeditious

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
expeditious
 
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.550 align:start position:0%
expeditious
project

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
this committee has often
 
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.830 align:start position:0%
this committee has often
transferred

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
transferred
 
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.110 align:start position:0%
transferred
funds

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
it's the committee that does it
 
00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
rather than waiting for the capital
 
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
budget to come around
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh in another year or so and in light of
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
the other upgrades have been done to the
 
00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039 align:start position:0%
state house i think this is in line with
 
00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
what we're trying
 
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
to do i can think of a couple of first
 
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.469 align:start position:0%
to do i can think of a couple of first
four

00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
offices where there's security issues
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
and also in terms of the visitor center
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
there's some issues with some valuable
 
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
property there as well so anyways i i
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
hear what you're saying i understand the
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
importance of process here but i do
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
think we're a committee that's
 
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
constituted to be able to approve such a
 
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.470 align:start position:0%
constituted to be able to approve such a
request

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
and that's just my feeling about it
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
and my response would be that
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
in my experience on this committee for
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
the last decade plus
 
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
those transfers have been made to
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
complete existing projects not establish
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
new projects just because there was
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
but what is the will of the committee
 
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.949 align:start position:0%
but what is the will of the committee
okay

00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
sorry okay
 
00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:31.519 align:start position:0%
so should we maybe table this item
 
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
and refer it to facilities is that you
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
know it would you maybe that would be an
 
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.190 align:start position:0%
know it would you maybe that would be an
appropriate

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
you know in your opinion if you can
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
state it
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
my preference is that at least have the
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
legislative facility general court
 
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
facilities committee look at this and
 
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
bring it back to us with
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
what they intend to do
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
how they intend to fund it because
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
i know that facilities
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
within the legislative system has some
 
00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
funds which may be enough to complete it
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to hear a lot more
 
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
information about it
 
00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:13.839 align:start position:0%
but again i'm only one member of the
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
committee so
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.430 align:start position:0%
 
senate

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
senator daniel savannah i'll get back to
 
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.829 align:start position:0%
senator daniel savannah i'll get back to
you

00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman is there a time
 
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
to you mr chairman do you know how long
 
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
it would take if we sent it to
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
facilities before we'd come back
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
no i'm not even sure at this point who
 
00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
the chair of the it's probably the
 
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
speaker and the senate president but
 
00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:03.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative phuko
 
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.519 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman mr chairman
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
apparently there's a million dollar
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
surplus from other security projects
 
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.430 align:start position:0%
surplus from other security projects
that's

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
what would be happened to that money if
 
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
we hold this up
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
that money stays
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
um there
 
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
because it was in the capital budget
 
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.829 align:start position:0%
because it was in the capital budget
and

00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
and it stays there until
 
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
the next capital budget is approved
 
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
so that they could come back any time
 
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
over the next year or so
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
to say that they want to use it for
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
security upgrades or other purposes
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
or even this same purpose
 
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't just automatically disappear
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
but now that it's been highlighted
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
everybody knows that it's there for
 
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.949 align:start position:0%
everybody knows that it's there for
um

00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:01.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i move to table and refer
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%

projects at least the administrative
 
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%

now

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
in addition to the capital projects
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
that were approved for the current
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
biennium we have projects that weren't
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
able to be completed during covid which
 
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
are also capital projects and then we
 
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
have arp funding that's come in um
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
allowing us to do additional projects so
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
it's really just a matter of workload
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
right now we're trying to spread it out
 
00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:55.839 align:start position:0%
so we don't burn out the employees that
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
we still do have because we are also
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
dealing with some staffing shortages as
 
00:16:00.079 --> 00:16:00.870 align:start position:0%
dealing with some staffing shortages as
well

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
any further
 
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
questions or comments seeing none i
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
would like to propose
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
that our next meeting be march 28th
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
which is a monday
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
it is after
 
00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
at least on the house side after our
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
last reporting
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
requirement for the before crossover
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
crossover is that com the thursday after
 
00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
that march 31st
 
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully the senate would be finished
 
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
with their hearings and reporting by
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
that monday
 
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
we get it out of the way before we start
 
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
getting inundated with the bills from
 
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
the other body
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%

purposes

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%

00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%

00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
relatively short meeting but
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
if we wait and let things stack up
 
00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:13.039 align:start position:0%
things do not get done thank you all for
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
