for the record my name is uh Chuck
 
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
grassy I'm state representative from W
 
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
for and Rochester New Hampshire um one
 
00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why I introduced this
 
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
bill uh hb12
 
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
21 was throughout the last year I've
 
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
been working with a number of
 
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
environmental groups um on different
 
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
environmental issues and one of the
 
00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
issues that always comes to the top is
 
00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 align:start position:0%
new landfills in the state of New
 
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and what their impact is on
 
00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
the communities that surround and
 
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
communities that are Downstream um
 
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
there's a concern about the public and
 
00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
one of the the big things that they said
 
00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 align:start position:0%
is that there's not enough opportunity
 
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
for input from the general public um and
 
00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
I know there is a process which has
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
hearings uh which they have he but a lot
 
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
of people feel left out of the process
 
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
so I said one of the ways we can solve
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
this problem is make the make this a uh
 
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
make any new newly created landfill a
 
00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
project of regional
 
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
impact and if those of you that have may
 
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
have served on planning boards in the
 
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
past know what a project of regional
 
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
impact happens in a community um the
 
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
application if it's declared a pro
 
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
Regional impact by the local planning
 
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
board it goes to the regional Planning
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
Commission they notify everybody uh
 
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
that's an abutter to that project every
 
00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
town that's an abutter to that project
 
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
and they hold a hearing the information
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
provided at that hearing the testimony
 
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
taken is then sent back to the planning
 
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
board what we're looking at doing this
 
00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 align:start position:0%
is a in a similar way that what would
 
00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:42.759 align:start position:0%
happen is is that a a a new landfill
 
00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
that was to be located in a County uh
 
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
whatever County they would in that
 
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
county would then have to notify what we
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
would consider a Butters and one of the
 
00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:52.039 align:start position:0%
things we looked at is because the
 
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
science is
 
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
still the science is still not really
 
00:06:58.869 --> 00:06:58.879 align:start position:0%
solid as far as groundwater is concerned
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
and the impact active landfills on
 
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
groundwater and all depends I mean we
 
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
have a and I will have to admit we have
 
00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
a very good landfill in in the city of
 
00:07:07.869 --> 00:07:07.879 align:start position:0%
Rochester and I know he's going to be
 
00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:10.759 align:start position:0%
here testifying against this bill uh but
 
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
the thing is is that um how can you look
 
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
at communities are going to be impacted
 
00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:18.039 align:start position:0%
and I looked at the maps and I said you
 
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
know if we took a look at it as far as
 
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
watersheds are
 
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
concerned that by identifying that any
 
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
Community within that Watershed and that
 
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
could be quite a few communities uh but
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
any community in that Watershed New
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has 18 different Weds by the
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
way um needs to be notified now they may
 
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
be Upstream they may be Downstream uh
 
00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
they may be anywhere to the sides of
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
that if a landfill is located on the
 
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:45.560 align:start position:0%
edge of the Watershed I also put in a 20
 
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
mile buffer uh those communities know
 
00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:51.639 align:start position:0%
more about their groundwater than
 
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
probably anybody else does because they
 
00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
live in those communities and they work
 
00:07:55.629 --> 00:07:55.639 align:start position:0%
in those communities they develop in
 
00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
those communities if they are concerned
 
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
they will get involved
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
but a lot of times they aren't even
 
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
given the opportunity to in have input
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
um and this would require another just
 
00:08:09.149 --> 00:08:09.159 align:start position:0%
another level of input the cost is quite
 
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
minimal um you know if a developer or an
 
00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:14.759 align:start position:0%
applicant had to pay a couple thousand
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
dollars to notify a Butters um that's
 
00:08:18.749 --> 00:08:18.759 align:start position:0%
not a lot of money when you're taking a
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
look at the projects that they're doing
 
00:08:21.629 --> 00:08:21.639 align:start position:0%
when you're taking a look at the time
 
00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:23.479 align:start position:0%
constraints yes that could be something
 
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:25.400 align:start position:0%
that could hold them up for 45 to 60
 
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
days uh while notifications are sting
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
out and and uh hearing is held and the
 
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
data is sent up to to the state um or to
 
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:36.200 align:start position:0%
the community and uh this is you know
 
00:08:37.949 --> 00:08:37.959 align:start position:0%
this is just something that gives more
 
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
transparency into the process and I
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
think that it's something we really need
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
to uh to consider is the transparency
 
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
into the process uh this is something we
 
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
see most people are against now there
 
00:08:54.509 --> 00:08:54.519 align:start position:0%
there is one error in the bill I checked
 
00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:57.320 align:start position:0%
my notes and it wasn't my fault uh but
 
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
online six yeah uh it says RSA 33 colon
 
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
56 and it's supposed to be 36 I checked
 
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
my original notes what I sent over to
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
legislative services and I did have 36
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
there so it uh we didn't pick it up
 
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
until just this weekend okay uh but um
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
it it's something that needs to be
 
00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:17.079 align:start position:0%
changed and I would also one of the
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
things that I know uh Waste Management
 
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
in Rochester will be here to testify on
 
00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
is they think that this should apply to
 
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
newly to new applica applications for
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
new uh landfills and I would suggest a
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
wording that since we're going to change
 
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
30 six if you decide to support this
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
bill is it we should say all newly
 
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
proposed uh Solid Waste landfills uh
 
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
sell be projects of regional impact and
 
00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:40.959 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm willing to accept that um I
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
think that it's something that uh we
 
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
could we could certainly uh we could
 
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
certainly live with and I would be happy
 
00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions sure I have a
 
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:52.519 align:start position:0%
couple of questions right off the bat
 
00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:55.959 align:start position:0%
um with your uh your suggestion for an
 
00:09:59.389 --> 00:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
amendment for newly proposed landfills
 
00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:01.959 align:start position:0%
um you would include you would not
 
00:10:01.959 --> 00:10:03.470 align:start position:0%
um you would include you would not
include

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
expansions well I think that would be up
 
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
to the committee to take a look at I'm
 
00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:08.959 align:start position:0%
not I I I don't necessarily think that
 
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
that needs to be in there because one of
 
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
the things that we have when there is a
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
landfill that's pre-existing we pretty
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
much know what's going on as far as the
 
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
groundwater's concerned um an expansion
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
would be on that same site and their
 
00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:22.519 align:start position:0%
impact on the groundwater may not be
 
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
significantly different than what is
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
currently there so we should have an
 
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
indication of what's being impacted uh
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
whereas a new landfill you don't know
 
00:10:31.069 --> 00:10:31.079 align:start position:0%
what's happening under the ground with
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
the aquifers and the groundwater um and
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's something when I in talking with
 
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
the regional planning commissions and
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
the Lakes Association um the concern was
 
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
is that pretty much anything Downstream
 
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
and in a watershed that's what you're
 
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
looking at things that are Downstream
 
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:50.200 align:start position:0%
but you never know because water
 
00:10:52.829 --> 00:10:52.839 align:start position:0%
hydrology tends sometimes to do weird
 
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
things and we don't know that so that's
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
why included within 20 miles and also
 
00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
anyone with in the Watershed now just
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
because you send a notification to a
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
community doesn't mean if they're well
 
00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
away from the Watershed and they
 
00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
personally feel they have no they're not
 
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
going to be impacted they just don't
 
00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:11.839 align:start position:0%
respond um but it will give them the
 
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to respond if they say Hey
 
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
you know we've got a large aquifer here
 
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
that's being impacted we have one in
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
Rochester an aquifer that's that's in
 
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
that's impacted from all the way up into
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
Farmington and into n Durham um and you
 
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
know we have to be concerned about that
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
that and it's a one that we now are
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
currently using for our wells and we're
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
finding that past is in it well where is
 
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
it coming from old Davidson rubber plant
 
00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:36.519 align:start position:0%
was in the northern part of that area up
 
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
in the northern pot of Farmington and we
 
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
feel there may be some impact from a
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
dump site that they had 30 years ago 40
 
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
years ago okay um some my my second
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
question is um in lines three through
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
five of your bill
 
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to figure out is that just
 
00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
a clarification of what the above line
 
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
on number two because it already says
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste Disposal
 
00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
facilities so why would that not include
 
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
any Solid Waste landfill requiring a
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
permit I mean aren't they all well this
 
00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:15.079 align:start position:0%
here is putting it putting it into the
 
00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:16.279 align:start position:0%
regional planning section of the
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
ordinances so basically they take
 
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
something out of another section of the
 
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
RSA stick it in here so that it
 
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
referenced a um we we wanted to Define
 
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
what would be con cons what would be
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
considered uh under uh Regional planning
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
because it puts it into the regional
 
00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:31.959 align:start position:0%
planning statutes that's not currently
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
there I see and why did you choose on
 
00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:40.519 align:start position:0%
line 11 20 miles that seems like a very
 
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number it it may be I mean we
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
have to have to pick out a number
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
somewhere and we what we wanted to do is
 
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
take a look at projects that may be
 
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
outside of a watershed but could be
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
impacted I mean one of the things you
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
have to consider that there also the
 
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
transportation of waste in and out of a
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
site uh and uh or and so 20 miles was a
 
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
number that was arbitrarily picked out U
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
the committee we're going to have to do
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
an amendment on this anyway so the
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
committee could arbitrarily change
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
it thank you very much represent Bixby
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so just a a question about the
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism of notification so the uh the
 
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
communities uh in within the scope
 
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
that's laid out in uh section three
 
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
Roman three would uh would the
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
notification go to the
 
00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
municipal government in each of those
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
communities and it would be up to the
 
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
municipal government to provide any
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
notice to the town's people or City's
 
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
people yes that would be accur I mean
 
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
there would be notifications in in
 
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
papers of public interest and but also
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh the municipalities with the notice
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
would to be up to them to to basically
 
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
do anything more that they that they
 
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to but I would hope that as
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
Selectmen or U City Council Members that
 
00:13:55.389 --> 00:13:55.399 align:start position:0%
they would that they would take it upon
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
themselves to get that out that they
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
reive this notification uh if anybody
 
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
has any information and they would like
 
00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
to participate in the public hearing
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
they're welcome to go to the public
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
hearing and Testify the testifies would
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
held be held somewhere within that
 
00:14:09.629 --> 00:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
county of the the regional planning
 
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
agency that was responsible but it could
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
cross over into other counties because
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
it's dealt with by Watershed and it
 
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
could also cross over into other states
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
because our watersheds are not confined
 
00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:21.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative Howard thank
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um are you not concerned
 
00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
about surface water why only groundw and
 
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
aers well I I am concerned about surface
 
00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959 align:start position:0%
water and when you deal with a watershed
 
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.240 align:start position:0%
you're concerned mostly with with
 
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
surface water but surface water gets
 
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
into the ground and one of the concerns
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
that I said use the entire Watershed
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
instead of just what's Downstream is
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
because subsurface water does strange
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
things and the hydrology may not act in
 
00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
the same way that the surface water is
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
acting so when you say if you've got a
 
00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:55.240 align:start position:0%
water shed and the land fill is in the
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
middle of that
 
00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
Watershed and you can see that the water
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
is heading in a certain direction in a
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
southernly direction uh that is it or
 
00:15:05.629 --> 00:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
following along a river such as the
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
marac river are those communities north
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
of it do they have any concern well you
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
don't know that's the thing we know
 
00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
where the groundwaters the surface
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
water's going we know where that's going
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of research that
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
allows us to do that we can figure that
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
out quite easily we don't know where the
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
where the subsurface water is going
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's why I included the whole
 
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.110 align:start position:0%
that's why I included the whole
watershed

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
watershed
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
area follow up um so you know what water
 
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
is going but do you know what's in it
 
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
that I mean that's that's sort of our
 
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
concern is is when these surface waters
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
are are poisoned where where they go is
 
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
is secondary to that I think right yeah
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
well it it when the surface water is
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
poisoned you know that you have to be
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
concerned about the subsurface water and
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
I and and that's why I set the areas as
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
large as they were or within an within a
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
watershed because that surface water
 
00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:55.839 align:start position:0%
will go will pretty much stay within
 
00:15:55.839 --> 00:15:56.670 align:start position:0%
will go will pretty much stay within
that

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:59.309 --> 00:15:59.319 align:start position:0%
Watershed um and so so you have to be
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
concerned about what's happening to the
 
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
well any other questions from the
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question representative
 
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering now how people are
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
notified um of an existing
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
landfill um and why people in
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
surrounding commun ities are not aware
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
and can't already come and testify they
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
do I mean communities that surround the
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
project are are notified and Dees and
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they'll be here to testify to
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
tell you what their notification process
 
00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
is uh but they are notified but the
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
thing is this creates more people can
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
get involved it provides a l a larger
 
00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
scope of involvement as far as people
 
00:16:53.309 --> 00:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
who are notified and I think that's one
 
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
of the concerns it's just one more
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
public hearing that we will have uh you
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
know it's I don't look at this being an
 
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
onerous bill that's going to pile all
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
kinds of requirements on them it's a
 
00:17:05.549 --> 00:17:05.559 align:start position:0%
relatively simple process and very
 
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
affordable process actually followup um
 
00:17:12.189 --> 00:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
you also mentioned uh that we might be
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
noting uh some of these uh areas would
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
take into consideration other states
 
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
would then we also be notifying the
 
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
folks in other states according to this
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
Bill yes I would if it's within the
 
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
Watershed they should be notified and so
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
I see nothing wrong with it because they
 
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
could be impacted and they may want to
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
have input into into the bill um you
 
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
know if there was a bill put on the
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state it would
 
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
significantly impact Massachusetts
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
communities and or if it's put on the uh
 
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
you know around the Connecticut River it
 
00:17:46.029 --> 00:17:46.039 align:start position:0%
could impact some Vermont Community
 
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
Water Supplies just having them giving
 
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
them the ability to come in and testify
 
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
um is pro you know is really no harm
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
what it does is it provides us with more
 
00:17:57.149 --> 00:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
information because we have to look at
 
00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
that our groundwater and our surface
 
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
surface waters are not confined to the
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um we are
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
impacted by other states and I think
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's just curious of us to provide them
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
with the opportunity to have input when
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
we impact possibly impact their
 
00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
groundwaters and their surface waters
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
one other followup thank you madam chair
 
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
um so are these other states uh
 
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
notifying us of anything that may impact
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
our state when it comes to watersheds
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
and surf ground subsurface I I I do not
 
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:28.919 align:start position:0%
know that ma'am and but I don't think
 
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
that makes really any
 
00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.070 align:start position:0%
that makes really any
difference

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
okay that's a question probably for when
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
we hear from representatives from Dees
 
00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you uh to the sponsor
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um my question
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
was along this the the lines of whether
 
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
or not Watershed organizations
 
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
themselves might be notified if you're
 
00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:55.559 align:start position:0%
if they are the entity that oftentimes
 
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
deals with the department they often
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
times deal with the public they're kind
 
00:18:59.710 --> 00:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
intermediary is there any intention to
 
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
actually notify those organizations I I
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
didn't put that in here that they would
 
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:07.640 align:start position:0%
have to be notified but going through
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
the regional planning commissions I
 
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
would assume that they would be U be
 
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
made aware of these hearings when
 
00:19:16.149 --> 00:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
they're held um it's it's something that
 
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
um uh they uh I I dealt with this as a
 
00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
regional planning issue rather than as a
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
you know any other way I figured this
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
was the the simplest way and we have
 
00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
Regional planning agencies throughout
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
State and it was the simplest way to get
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
this out to the general public okay
 
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
representa B I just wanted to to clarify
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
something about something about the
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
scope in number three um so it's located
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
within any wed where there such a
 
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
landfill may be proposed uh and so that
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
if you're talking about say Lancaster
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
then that's a kinetic River Watershed so
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
if you just looked at that you'd say
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
well well are we going to have to like
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
notify people in Walpole and you know
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
Southern cheser County uh and then
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
Brattleboro uh but uh it looks like the
 
00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
there's an and there so that it has to
 
00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
be ALS it also has to be within 20 miles
 
00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:18.039 align:start position:0%
is that correct uh no and the thing is
 
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
that one located within the Watershed
 
00:20:22.029 --> 00:20:22.039 align:start position:0%
and located within 20 miles of the pro
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
it probably shouldn't have the end in
 
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
there because they're two different
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
things okay so in fact you would want
 
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
notification all the way to all of all
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
of the counties in Massachusetts and
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
Connecticut that are in the Connecticut
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
Valley Watershed that would
 
00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:44.039 align:start position:0%
be uh because for for a project in
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
Lancaster well there it the watersheds
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
along the Connecticut River are divided
 
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
up into I see one two three four
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
different watersheds that um one of them
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
does go below the state of New Hampshire
 
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
the fifth one is pretty much out of it
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
so they wouldn't it wouldn't be
 
00:21:03.149 --> 00:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily be the whole thing you'd
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
have to take a look at the Watershed map
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
that that Dees has and as I said there
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
are 18 different watersheds and the
 
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
connectica river is divided up into into
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
a number of different uh water sheds
 
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
okay so is that uh is there something in
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
statute that uh establishes those
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
watersheds as being um the entities that
 
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
are being looked at um
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
Dees has that information and that's
 
00:21:32.669 --> 00:21:32.679 align:start position:0%
another thing that probably should be
 
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
done we should state that as watersheds
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
as defined by Dees okay and reference
 
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
their rules thank
 
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
committee represent comto thank you
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair um you just held up a nice
 
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
little Nifty U map uh is it possible to
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
get a copy for the file I will be happy
 
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
to give this to you thank
 
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
much representative grassy thank you um
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
query from the New Hampshire Sierra Club
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
good morning and welcome to environment
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
agriculture good morning thank you so
 
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
much um my name is Katherine Corry I'm
 
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire Sierra Club and it's
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
great to be here in
 
00:22:28.269 --> 00:22:28.279 align:start position:0%
Ena uh my first real committee that I
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
have um been able to participate in um
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
20 years ago so it's
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
great um happy anniversary
 
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
right um uh so uh New Hampshire Seer
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
Club represents about 12,000 people in
 
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
the state members and supporters and we
 
00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
support the spirit of this bill um and I
 
00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
too um wanted to suggest a friendly
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh to help Define who gets the
 
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
notice um I my suggestion for
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh Roman three was to perhaps um include
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
AB budding political
 
00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
entities um so that we would get
 
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
Watershed District or um water and sewer
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
districts we could get downtown or
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
business districts school districts like
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
all of these different um components uh
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they got the notice about
 
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
these public
 
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.789 align:start position:0%
these public
meetings

00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:35.799 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
um I do that because I suggest that
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about Regional
 
00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
impacts um that I that would go beyond
 
00:23:50.909 --> 00:23:50.919 align:start position:0%
uh 20 miles you know some to some towns
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
um I was it it wasn't clear to me if
 
00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
this was a 20 mile radius or if this is
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
20 mil along the road
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
um what did that mean and so I think
 
00:24:09.789 --> 00:24:09.799 align:start position:0%
identifying um actual entities like a
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
sewage District Like a downtown district
 
00:24:15.549 --> 00:24:15.559 align:start position:0%
or a school district uh would really
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
help um with the participation in in
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
transparency uh this is this is about
 
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
transparency and Regional impact and
 
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
uh with that I do support the bill um
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
and uh we'll take any
 
00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
NAB thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question are you aware if um
 
00:24:44.389 --> 00:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
political entities are also notified for
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
any of the other Regional impacts um I
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
am aware uh that there are AB budding
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
towns um usually is how it's
 
00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
identified um
 
00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
and I have I I'm not going to know the
 
00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
statute number but I have seen um that
 
00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
definition before uh I can I can try to
 
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
I you know Wrangle that um ARA for
 
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
Murray um thank you madam chair and
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
thank you uh to that end I was I was
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
curious to know if something more along
 
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
the lines of I think uh Department of
 
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.230 align:start position:0%
the lines of I think uh Department of
Transportation

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
Transportation
 
00:25:30.269 --> 00:25:30.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes has political subdivisions
 
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
that that span across multiple entities
 
00:25:35.789 --> 00:25:35.799 align:start position:0%
to notify of changes to Highway
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
Transportation plans or anything of the
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
sort is that what you were maybe
 
00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
referring to I think that is I think
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
that is and and we there are Regional
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
sewage and water districts um that may
 
00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:50.919 align:start position:0%
not be
 
00:25:54.389 --> 00:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
captured exactly so I I and I think
 
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
that's really
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%

Waste Management um in New Hampshire and
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
um just a little background on the
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
company um where the largest provider of
 
00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:31.519 align:start position:0%
solid waste U Services in the country
 
00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
and in New Hampshire we manage uh over
 
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
30% of the solid waste for the State of
 
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we operate the turnkey
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
facility in uh Rochester and we have
 
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
four transfer stations and over uh 200
 
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
collection vehicles uh more than half of
 
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
those are currently running on natural
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
gas uh servicing our customers across
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
the state um so this experience and our
 
00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
involvement and what's been going on in
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
the state mine personally over the last
 
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
30 plus years gives us a unique
 
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:08.200 align:start position:0%
perspective on this bill and um you know
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
the impacts that it would have have on
 
00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
us and have on others uh we oppose the
 
00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:16.039 align:start position:0%
bill is currently written um
 
00:29:16.039 --> 00:29:18.230 align:start position:0%
bill is currently written um
HB

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
HB
 
00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:21.519 align:start position:0%
1221 uh we don't feel this is uh
 
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
necessary the permitting of a solid
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
waste facility such as the one in turn
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
key uh has an extensive lengthy process
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh in the permitting uh that's required
 
00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
not only locally but at the state level
 
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
and uh at the federal
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
EPA um there's a technical review
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
process there's a public benefit
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
analysis that needs to be done uh
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
there's public notice there's public
 
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
comment uh and there's public hearings
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
that currently take place and that
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
notification goes out uh Statewide it's
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
published in the local paper it's
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
published in the Manchester Union leader
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
and the agency uh Dees does a good job
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
you know getting that word out so
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
letting folks know those public hearings
 
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
are taking
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
place um in the most recent um expansion
 
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
that we did at the turnkey facility it
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
took us over six years to get the permit
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
under the current uh regulations and
 
00:30:19.549 --> 00:30:19.559 align:start position:0%
this bill I think would extend that
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
further and really make it difficult to
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
continue operating be beyond what we
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:34.269 --> 00:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
the first provision in the bill uh talks
 
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:37.480 align:start position:0%
about that uh all communities within the
 
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
Watershed uh need to be notified the
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
current permitting process that is
 
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
already in place is that the applicant
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
needs to uh notify the New Hampshire
 
00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
Rivers coordinator for the dees and they
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
in turn reach out to the affected River
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
advisory committees they're given notice
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
of the project and where it is what the
 
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
extent of that is and you know
 
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
that they need to sign off if you will
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
that they have a concern or they don't
 
00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:11.720 align:start position:0%
have a concern if they do they weigh in
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
from a public comment standpoint or you
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
know our present at the public
 
00:31:18.669 --> 00:31:18.679 align:start position:0%
meetings um and as a result of that we
 
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
feel this is not you know an additional
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
necessary step that needs to take place
 
00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:25.480 align:start position:0%
relative to uh the river potential
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
impacts uh the second Vision regarding
 
00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:31.720 align:start position:0%
notifications within a 20m radius uh we
 
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
feel this is excessive uh We've looked
 
00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
at it at our
 
00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:37.799 align:start position:0%
facility and it
 
00:31:41.629 --> 00:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
reaches uh up to Lake wiip
 
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
Northampton uh Candia shapley main Kenny
 
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
bunkport and it's a it's a pretty
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
significant area I'm just a quick Google
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
Maps you can't see this I know but um I
 
00:31:56.629 --> 00:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
can leave this with you it shows a
 
00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
pretty EX extensive uh review and
 
00:32:03.629 --> 00:32:03.639 align:start position:0%
concern that we have is um you if we
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
need to weigh everyone's concerns within
 
00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
a 20 milei radius or anyone else getting
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
uh a permit to develop you know a new or
 
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
an existing facility continue to be
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
expanded is going to be extremely
 
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
difficult um we currently notice right
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
now um not only the uh folks that are
 
00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:28.039 align:start position:0%
Butters to the parcel on which the
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
development is going to take place but
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
we go out to the limits of our property
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
uh we own about 1500 Acres at that
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
location in Rochester and notification
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
goes out to town of barington and the
 
00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:44.039 align:start position:0%
City of so they're notified as well AB
 
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
budding municipalities and they have
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to weigh in um you know at
 
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
the public hearing or provide comments
 
00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:54.200 align:start position:0%
to the the New Hampshire uh Dees as part
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
process um
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know we we take our relationship
 
00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
with the host Community very seriously
 
00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
um and we feel that this bill would
 
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
expand considerably those folks that may
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
or may not have impacts as a result of
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
the you know existing operation um if
 
00:33:21.149 --> 00:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
there's issues at the site we will take
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
you know whatever steps are necessary to
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
address those and again concerning uh
 
00:33:29.669 --> 00:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
neighboring municipalities we do the
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
same there as well we don't reach out to
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
folks that are 20 miles away from the
 
00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
facility uh if there's a concern
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
obviously um we'd be happy to address
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
any issues that they may have uh at any
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
level or any you know steps along the
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
way so um those are my comments if um
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
folks have any questions be happy to
 
00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:49.629 align:start position:0%
folks have any questions be happy to
answer

00:33:49.629 --> 00:33:49.639 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
them thank you Mr POI um so I'm
 
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
interested to know how do you notify
 
00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
folks current L okay so we have to look
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
at our property if we have a
 
00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
parcel uh that's in the middle or just
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know we go to the limits of our
 
00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
property ownership so we currently go to
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
all the ab Butters that touch our
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
property and we notify them uh in our
 
00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
case we are close to the do and
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
barington Town Line so we reach into
 
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
those communities as well uh we know
 
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
notify uh the city and Public Notices go
 
00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
out um you know through the the papers
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh as well so there's a number of
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
different notification processes that
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
take place are they done in the
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
newspaper VIA mail via email via what
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
are what are the ways Billboards I mean
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know no they're done certified
 
00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
mail uh return receipt requested so we
 
00:34:55.629 --> 00:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that we get all those
 
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
back the state checks to make sure that
 
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
those notices are received um and if not
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
we have to chase people down sometimes
 
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
folks own property and they live in
 
00:35:08.589 --> 00:35:08.599 align:start position:0%
California we've had a couple of those
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
over the years um so they need to get
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
that returned to us and then uh from a
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
public hearing standpoint um the state
 
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
well we put it out but the state
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
administers it notifications in the
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
local paper and Statewide distribution
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
um so it's done a number of different
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
ways and so in your testimony you
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned that by
 
00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
expanding um the area by which you would
 
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
have to do
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
notification that it would cause
 
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
difficulty what kind of difficulty would
 
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
that ensue we've had we've had
 
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
discussions uh with municipalities that
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
have indicated they've got trucks
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
driving through their Community it's all
 
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
on state highways in our case but
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
nonethe less driving through their
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
communities and they feel they should
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
participate in the host Community uh
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
agreement that we have with the city of
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
Rochester we pay
 
00:36:10.589 --> 00:36:10.599 align:start position:0%
Rochester over $4 million a year in a
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
variety of different host fees we
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
provide uh free disposal csite
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
collection a host per you know feet per
 
00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
ton and if we've got a variety of
 
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
different communities weighing in and
 
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
wanting a piece of that it's going to
 
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
make it more difficult for us to
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
negotiate 15 20 different host Community
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
agreements because they feel they're
 
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
being impacted in some way okay
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah so just to
 
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
follow up on that does this bill
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
establish those notice other notice
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
communities as host communities or does
 
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
it just require notice for they for them
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to attend a a public hearing
 
00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
we interpreted just requiring notice
 
00:37:02.589 --> 00:37:02.599 align:start position:0%
okay so so in fact there wouldn't be any
 
00:37:05.069 --> 00:37:05.079 align:start position:0%
any sort of basis in law if this bill
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
went through for them to request to have
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
any sort of host Community
 
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
status that that's our interpretation I
 
00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
I do know that we've had experiences
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
over years not at this facility in
 
00:37:21.309 --> 00:37:21.319 align:start position:0%
particular but at another
 
00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:23.720 align:start position:0%
location um that their objections would
 
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
be removed if there was a host community
 
00:37:28.349 --> 00:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
agreement for our
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
municipality different site different
 
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
state but uh that's a concern that we
 
00:37:38.349 --> 00:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
kraton thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
you for your
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
testimony so the the way the bill reads
 
00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
and the way your your map U was
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
diagrammed was that you have TurnKey for
 
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
example and then you have a 20 mile
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
radius or diameter all the way around in
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
a circle that's including upstream and
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
downstream that's correct would that uh
 
00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
would it would your analysis be
 
00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:06.200 align:start position:0%
different if it was only
 
00:38:08.109 --> 00:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
Downstream with the assumption that
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
water primarily is going to flow
 
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
downhill yeah the the bill currently
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
States quote located within 20 miles of
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
such a proposed landfill location and
 
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
our interpretation is a 20 mile
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
radius for a followup followup so if if
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
the bill for for example said down
 
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
stream as opposed to radius would how
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
much do you think that would change your
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
analysis well it would reduce the 20
 
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
mile notification um requirement
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
obviously um but Downstream I think
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative bck spe brought up a good
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
point uh if you've got a site and you're
 
00:38:48.599 --> 00:38:49.550 align:start position:0%
point uh if you've got a site and you're
you

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
know Watershed flows down the
 
00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River for example it goes
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
through adjoining States you'd be
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
notifying folks all the way down to
 
00:38:59.790 --> 00:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Massachusetts I don't think
 
00:39:02.349 --> 00:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
that's really intent of Representative
 
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
Bry but you know that could be
 
00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
interpreted that
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
way okay represent Murray thank you
 
00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
question I just wanted to clarify when
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
you're talking about those who are
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
notified via certified mail those are
 
00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
only direct abutters is that correct uh
 
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
that's correct um I believe we notify
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins and then NAB
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question so we're talking
 
00:39:39.309 --> 00:39:39.319 align:start position:0%
about Regional impact here right and
 
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:41.720 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony that the water
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
goes where the water wants to go so if
 
00:39:50.309 --> 00:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
outlying communities are going to be
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
impacted but they're not a
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
Butters shouldn't we be concerned about
 
00:40:00.309 --> 00:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
those communities having agency and
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
that's my first
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
question and the second question is
 
00:40:10.589 --> 00:40:10.599 align:start position:0%
Dees has a lot on their plate so
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
notifying the rivers
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
Association may not get the kind of um
 
00:40:22.349 --> 00:40:22.359 align:start position:0%
response or the kind of scope that we're
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
thinking about in terms of regional
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
impact so what are your thoughts about
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
that okay couple couple things uh
 
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
relative to the
 
00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.870 align:start position:0%
relative to the
de's

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
de's
 
00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
um responsibilities or what they've got
 
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:41.240 align:start position:0%
on their plate um this would I believe
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
expand that considerably um you will
 
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
have a lot more folks weighing in um and
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
the state will have to State the dees
 
00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
will will be expanding the review
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
process um to include towns 20 m miles
 
00:40:59.710 --> 00:40:59.720 align:start position:0%
away that will add additional workload I
 
00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
believe on the agency to address those
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
questions to your first question
 
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
relative to uh impacts uh there are
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
requirements uh in the permitting uh and
 
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh operation uh requirements for the
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
site for any site to have groundwater
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
monitoring Wells within close proximity
 
00:41:22.349 --> 00:41:22.359 align:start position:0%
to the footprint uh surface water
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
sampling uh that information is uh
 
00:41:27.309 --> 00:41:27.319 align:start position:0%
collected uh Prov Prov to the state's
 
00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
public information uh so before it gets
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
to a river um folks are going to know
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
about it ahead of time and be able to
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
put actions in place quick followup if I
 
00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
may sure thank you um I don't think it's
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
the Bill's intent to put on to
 
00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:51.160 align:start position:0%
Dees any more of this work we're talking
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
about the permite having the
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility of getting this
 
00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
information to outling communities that
 
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
are going to be impacted that don't seem
 
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
to currently fall under the RSA for
 
00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
abutters and so forth Just understood
 
00:42:12.109 --> 00:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative NAB and
 
00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
then Bixby thank you madam chair thank
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
you for being here um so I think it's
 
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
great that there's notification to the
 
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
local River advisory committees but it's
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding that those are
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
volunteer committees made up with from
 
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
representatives from each town along the
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
River so do you see a benefit in having
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
a response come from actual Town
 
00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:35.720 align:start position:0%
staff that are impacted by the River or
 
00:42:38.549 --> 00:42:38.559 align:start position:0%
abing the river I I think that's fine
 
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
they want to notify Downstream
 
00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
communities okay thank you just before
 
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby I know that
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative kraton um is a volunteer
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
on one of those committees right uh I
 
00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
think everything we do is volunteer
 
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
except for the $100 a year we get paid
 
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
um no I am on the Kentuck North Branch
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
River Community and it includes towns
 
00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:04.630 align:start position:0%
River Community and it includes towns
that

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
start uh Ren Jaffrey almost all the way
 
00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
to conquer and uh we meet once a month
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
we are we are appointed by the town
 
00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
there are normally two members per town
 
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
and anything that
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
impacts the KCK North Branch Rivers
 
00:43:27.069 --> 00:43:27.079 align:start position:0%
which is what we're responsible for for
 
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
and that includes building permits that
 
00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
includes for example town of antram just
 
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
upgraded their water system uh and so we
 
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
go to the site we get with Dees we talk
 
00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:43.720 align:start position:0%
to local Representatives as in like
 
00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
Selectmen but also people are budding
 
00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
those those activities and then we are
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
uh required to sign off on those
 
00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
projects and we look at probably
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
two to three projects a month um that
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
impact those rivers and it's all the to
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
all the towns have to tap to chop off on
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
it so a major landfill going in would be
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
a significant uh event the president of
 
00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:16.630 align:start position:0%
a significant uh event the president of
our

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
committee uh is an engineer with
 
00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.030 align:start position:0%
committee uh is an engineer with
hydrological

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
hydrological
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
background represent vix you had a
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
question yes so um if uh if the bill
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
were amended to uh create a grandfather
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
clause for existing landfills that are
 
00:44:39.549 --> 00:44:39.559 align:start position:0%
uh see that are seeking expansions would
 
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
you be more comfortable with the bill we
 
00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:43.109 align:start position:0%
you be more comfortable with the bill we
would

00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:44:43.119 --> 00:44:44.990 align:start position:0%
would
yes

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair um I these
 
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
notifications that you send out now are
 
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
they all mandated by the state yes
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
um so so a less scrupulous company would
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
still have to fulfill those same
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
notification requirements that's correct
 
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate you answering all our
 
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
questions like to Now call Michael norc
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:33.109 align:start position:0%
 
Dees

00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you members
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh for the record
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
Michael Nor I'm here representing New
 
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees uh I'm in the solid waste
 
00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.349 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees uh I'm in the solid waste
management

00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
Bureau uh I think the sponsor did a
 
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
pretty good job of outlining what the
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
scope of this bill would be uh but I
 
00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:52.280 align:start position:0%
just want to reiterate that as we read
 
00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
it as as this bill is introduced um this
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
would govern the local planning use
 
00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
board uh notification and hearing
 
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
process as outlined in RSA
 
00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
36 uh there's been a lot of testimony
 
00:46:08.829 --> 00:46:08.839 align:start position:0%
and conversation around de's
 
00:46:10.349 --> 00:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
notification requirements for the
 
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
permitting the state permitting process
 
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
which is separate and distinct from the
 
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
local planning use board or planning
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
board um process for uh in notifying um
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
and so this this bill would only kick in
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
if a local planning board receives an
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
appliation for development of a
 
00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:31.720 align:start position:0%
landfill um so I just wanted to just
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
clarify that for the record that is our
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
understanding of what this bill's scope
 
00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:37.640 align:start position:0%
would be um and DS is not taking a
 
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
position on this bill however we do we
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
just wanted to be here to present some
 
00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
concerns relative to how we read this
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
bill uh what it's ex the extent of its
 
00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:49.880 align:start position:0%
uh notification requirements might be
 
00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
and how that might impact local planning
 
00:46:54.349 --> 00:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
use boards uh as was noted there would
 
00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
be uh a 20 M radius requirement so if
 
00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
the landfill is proposed in a given town
 
00:47:02.549 --> 00:47:02.559 align:start position:0%
uh there would need to be notice given
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
to surrounding communities within 20
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
miles on all sides uh and that would
 
00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
exist that requirement for not
 
00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
notification would exist over and above
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
a requirement for notifying communities
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
also within the same Watershed as the
 
00:47:18.079 --> 00:47:19.030 align:start position:0%
also within the same Watershed as the
proposed

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
landfill um one of the challenges with
 
00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%
the way the bill is written is it
 
00:47:22.839 --> 00:47:24.190 align:start position:0%
the way the bill is written is it
doesn't

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:24.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
Define what watered is I think the
 
00:47:28.589 --> 00:47:28.599 align:start position:0%
committee has already kind of clued into
 
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
that um and depending on how you define
 
00:47:34.109 --> 00:47:34.119 align:start position:0%
the extent of a watershed it could
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
Encompass hundreds of communities across
 
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
state borders I mean the Connecticut
 
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
River Watershed goes all the way down to
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
Long Island Sound um so you know you can
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
you can and I'm not an expert on um
 
00:47:50.349 --> 00:47:50.359 align:start position:0%
hydrogeology or how watersheds are are
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
delineated in the state I noted that uh
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Podi had a map that Dees has has
 
00:47:59.549 --> 00:47:59.559 align:start position:0%
developed that's a separate section of
 
00:48:01.549 --> 00:48:01.559 align:start position:0%
Dees so I can't really speak to that but
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
I do know that there are different uh
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
kind of subsets within uh watersheds so
 
00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:08.200 align:start position:0%
there's greater watersheds kind of at a
 
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
macro scale and then they're kind of
 
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
broken down into smaller pieces as well
 
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
and that's shown on that map um and uh
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
so so the bill doesn't really provide
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
Clarity on what the extent of the
 
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
Watershed would be um and we just think
 
00:48:24.589 --> 00:48:24.599 align:start position:0%
that they're again we don't take a
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%
position we don't necessarily OS this
 
00:48:28.589 --> 00:48:28.599 align:start position:0%
that we're all for transparency on all
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
levels um but we do have concerns on how
 
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
a local planning board might be able to
 
00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:35.720 align:start position:0%
determine compliance with the
 
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
requirements here and and make
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
notifications as required um so I just
 
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to to state that for the record
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions
 
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.750 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions
representative

00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
kraton uh thank you madam chair thank
 
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
you again so the way you read this then
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
does any one of these 100 towns I'm
 
00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
throwing that out there as you draw a
 
00:48:59.549 --> 00:48:59.559 align:start position:0%
circle that's 20 miles in
 
00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
radius does each one of those have a
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
veto power or what I mean so you notify
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
them then can they say okay well we
 
00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
don't want this you can't have it is
 
00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
that I mean what what is the power of
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
that town once notified that's a good
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative Katon
 
00:49:20.589 --> 00:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
I think as we read it um it's
 
00:49:22.829 --> 00:49:22.839 align:start position:0%
essentially a notification requirement
 
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
to notify surrounding communities that
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
may be impact Ed um to allow them to
 
00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:29.839 align:start position:0%
provide input at a hearing process you
 
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
know the local planning board's uh you
 
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
know hearing for the application that
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
they receive for the landfill okay so I
 
00:49:38.829 --> 00:49:38.839 align:start position:0%
don't think that they necessarily have a
 
00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
veto power but they have the opportunity
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
to provide input okay thank
 
00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
you representative H Haskins and then
 
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
NAB thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'd like to hear
 
00:49:51.789 --> 00:49:51.799 align:start position:0%
a little bit more about the planning use
 
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
board could you describe what that is De
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
it would only take effect if local
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
planning board gets a notice I'm trying
 
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
to follow that thank you for the
 
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
question this this is not necessarily
 
00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:06.710 align:start position:0%
question this this is not necessarily
within

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
within
 
00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:09.559 align:start position:0%
DS's area of expertise or or something
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
that we necessarily govern or regulate
 
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
this is the so when I referred to local
 
00:50:17.069 --> 00:50:17.079 align:start position:0%
planning use boards uh it's essentially
 
00:50:21.069 --> 00:50:21.079 align:start position:0%
a town or jurisdiction or a district
 
00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
that uh has
 
00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
planning uh kind of uh Authority or
 
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility for a given jurisdiction
 
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
they would have to provide local
 
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
approval for a development project in
 
00:50:37.349 --> 00:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
this case we're talking about Solid
 
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
Waste landfill um so I think what this
 
00:50:44.789 --> 00:50:44.799 align:start position:0%
bill would aim to do is to enable
 
00:50:47.549 --> 00:50:47.559 align:start position:0%
those it would it would essentially
 
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
Define landfills as a project that would
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
have Regional impact it would take away
 
00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
the the need for them to make that
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
determination mhm and it would then uh
 
00:50:59.829 --> 00:50:59.839 align:start position:0%
require them to notify communities as
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
defined within the 20 mile radius and
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
also within the Watershed so again it
 
00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
just governs the local approval process
 
00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
and the notification requirements
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
associated with that quick followup as I
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
may and and we're talking about
 
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
notification we're not talking about
 
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
agency we're not talking about voting
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
we're just talking about notification
 
00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
and transparency being the goal
 
00:51:23.069 --> 00:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
notification it would appear should be
 
00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:25.480 align:start position:0%
part of that no I believe you're correct
 
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
I think that that's in line with our
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
reading of the bill it's about
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
notification transparency which on its
 
00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
face sounds uh reasonable uh we just
 
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
have concerns about the extent to which
 
00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:38.839 align:start position:0%
municipalities may need to to the the
 
00:51:40.789 --> 00:51:40.799 align:start position:0%
essentially the reach of the
 
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
notifications understood thank you
 
00:51:44.109 --> 00:51:44.119 align:start position:0%
representative NAB and then
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby thank you madam
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
chair um I also have concerns about how
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
broad the 20 mile radius is and if it's
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
a little bit arbitrary I know you're not
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
a hydrologist but do you have any
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
thoughts about what more appropriate
 
00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
distance would be I um like you I can't
 
00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:01.960 align:start position:0%
really say what would be more
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate um I I think it's just a
 
00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
question of what is reasonable for the
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
given project and and I can't say for
 
00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
sure what that would
 
00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
be followup do you have any suggestions
 
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:23.480 align:start position:0%
number um nothing concrete at this at
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
this time I'm sorry okay pres viby uh
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
representative nav just asked my
 
00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.470 align:start position:0%
representative nav just asked my
question

00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
okay I've been wondering that as well
 
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
committee thank you I appreciate your uh
 
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
you're coming to speak with us is there
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh in the room I have no
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
more pink cards so anyone else wish to
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
this I'll need a pink card after you
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
speak please rep and introduce yourself
 
00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
again yeah my name is Wayne Morrison I'm
 
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
with North Country Alliance for balance
 
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
change I hadn't intended to speak today
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't have written
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
testimony or anything um I just want to
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
um encourage the
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
committee um these bills we often get
 
00:53:21.069 --> 00:53:21.079 align:start position:0%
wrapped up in the complexity of the bill
 
00:53:23.309 --> 00:53:23.319 align:start position:0%
and we we get into minutia and I I
 
00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
recognize that the committee
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to have a bill that
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
the language is clear and it's and it's
 
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
something that can be
 
00:53:33.789 --> 00:53:33.799 align:start position:0%
enacted but the purpose of the bill to
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
to as I read it was the recognition
 
00:53:42.109 --> 00:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
that um the physical spot where a
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
landfill is
 
00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
located the plot of land and that
 
00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
town um is a is a is a minor piece of
 
00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
the people that are impacted by a
 
00:53:54.319 --> 00:53:55.789 align:start position:0%
the people that are impacted by a
landfill

00:53:55.789 --> 00:53:55.799 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
and whether it's noise or smell or
 
00:54:02.789 --> 00:54:02.799 align:start position:0%
traffic the actual impact area of a
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
landfill is fairly large and I I applaud
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
the bill for recognizing
 
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
that people that are going to be
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
impacted should have a
 
00:54:17.309 --> 00:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
voice I would also want the committee as
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
somebody who has been actively involved
 
00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
in this for the last four or five
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
years without being a iepc I can tell
 
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
you that having a voice and taking the
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
time and energy to come and make your
 
00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
feelings and your concerns
 
00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
known often feels like you're you're
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
talking into the
 
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
wind there's no
 
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
feedback um it often feels like you know
 
00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:49.720 align:start position:0%
it's merely an exercise a box to be
 
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
checked off that you had a a public
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
hearing and I I would encourage the
 
00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
committee to to kind of push through
 
00:54:59.470 --> 00:54:59.480 align:start position:0%
some of these issues but the the bigger
 
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
issue to me is recognizing how impactful
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
landfills are and I I'll give you a
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
quick example my wife and I own property
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
on Forest Lake if you drew a line down
 
00:55:14.589 --> 00:55:14.599 align:start position:0%
the middle of forest lake half the lake
 
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
is in the town of Dalton and half the
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
lake is in the town of
 
00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
Whitefield I I am not one here uh
 
00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
looking to tap into the host agreement
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm happy to pay my
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
taxes but I am going to be far more
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
impacted in Whitefield than the people
 
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
in Dalton just because physically where
 
00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
that landfill would be
 
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
located and I don't feel as a citizen
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
that I'm really being given the type of
 
00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
voice that I should have to say my my my
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
property values my quality of life is
 
00:55:51.549 --> 00:55:51.559 align:start position:0%
going to be tremendously impacted and I
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
think that's true of Littleton and
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem and I don't know about a 20
 
00:55:59.870 --> 00:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
mile Zone I I I haven't done any I I
 
00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
understand there's some Logistics to
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
this and I don't this this is a
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
complicated process I I get that if I
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
were you I would eliminate the existing
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
landfills and I would I think we should
 
00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
focus on the go forward and apply it to
 
00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:13.960 align:start position:0%
New landfills but this is something
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
worth doing and it's a a real impact and
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
I think that the committee should not
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
disregard this or drop it because of
 
00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:23.960 align:start position:0%
complexity we should simplify it to the
 
00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
extent we can and I think the overriding
 
00:56:28.589 --> 00:56:28.599 align:start position:0%
principle is not how do we make this
 
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:30.799 align:start position:0%
easier for Dees or easier for the
 
00:56:33.789 --> 00:56:33.799 align:start position:0%
applicant how do we make this more effed
 
00:56:35.029 --> 00:56:35.039 align:start position:0%
effective for the people that are going
 
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
to be impacted by these these landfills
 
00:56:39.789 --> 00:56:39.799 align:start position:0%
and I would I would just I guess I would
 
00:56:41.789 --> 00:56:41.799 align:start position:0%
just ask you not to give up on this bill
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
I think it's there's some there's some
 
00:56:47.789 --> 00:56:47.799 align:start position:0%
Merit here and as a citizen um and I
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
think you know representative kryon as
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
you as you talked about this and you
 
00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
said you know you asked some you know
 
00:56:57.069 --> 00:56:57.079 align:start position:0%
questions um you know I I I do think
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
that it's you know there there's real
 
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
power in giving people a voice and um I
 
00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:05.640 align:start position:0%
don't think that's the case today I I I
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
there's this landfill that's keeps
 
00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
coming up in Dalton there's n 900 people
 
00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:14.029 align:start position:0%
coming up in Dalton there's n 900 people
in

00:57:14.029 --> 00:57:14.039 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
Dalton um I think of this as the impact
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
zone is much bigger than that um and if
 
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
we just focus on this little Community
 
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
yes that's more manageable
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
um and that that is physically where the
 
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
landfill is going to be but that is in
 
00:57:34.109 --> 00:57:34.119 align:start position:0%
no way the the impact um area that is
 
00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
going to affect many many more people
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
and uh livelihoods and businesses and I
 
00:57:41.549 --> 00:57:41.559 align:start position:0%
just I would encourage you to uh Wade
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
through this and and find a way to come
 
00:57:46.349 --> 00:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
up with it making this bill
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate so I have a question for you
 
00:57:51.029 --> 00:57:51.039 align:start position:0%
with regard
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
to I'm sure that with and then I don't
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
want I don't really want to get into
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
like specifics per se but there have
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
been hearings I'm imagining in the
 
00:58:04.079 --> 00:58:07.069 align:start position:0%
been hearings I'm imagining in the
Dalton

00:58:07.069 --> 00:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
area what community of people do you
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
feel did not have a voice and how did
 
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
they not have a voice in the current
 
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
process um I think the people who have a
 
00:58:22.589 --> 00:58:22.599 align:start position:0%
voice are people like myself who have
 
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:25.160 align:start position:0%
become very active in this but I think a
 
00:58:28.789 --> 00:58:28.799 align:start position:0%
lot of other people um I I think one of
 
00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
the problems is people think that if the
 
00:58:32.589 --> 00:58:32.599 align:start position:0%
landfill isn't in their backyard it
 
00:58:35.029 --> 00:58:35.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect them I don't know about
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
the notice process I mean I can tell you
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
that every public hearing that I have
 
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:42.799 align:start position:0%
gone to and and and one of them that
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
went on for I don't know six or seven
 
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
hours of people one after another
 
00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
getting up and describing why they don't
 
00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:49.960 align:start position:0%
want a
 
00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
landfill um I I'm not sure that that
 
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
process is all that effective and I
 
00:58:57.029 --> 00:58:57.039 align:start position:0%
don't I'm not sure anyone's
 
00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
listening um I don't know if that's the
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
best vehicle um that it has no meat I
 
00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
mean I I think the idea of allowing
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
people making it transparent and giving
 
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
people a voice is important but you
 
00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
didn't have any kind of situation where
 
00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
um you went to a meeting and they said
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
well you live in Whitefield so we we
 
00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:19.720 align:start position:0%
don't really want to listen to what you
 
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
have to say yeah no no uh we we we we
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
had a voice um but the the mechanisms
 
00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:27.270 align:start position:0%
had a voice um but the the mechanisms
and

00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
the um the the the way that the process
 
00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:35.240 align:start position:0%
works um planning boards select boards
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
um I think if you're not in the host
 
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
Community you are you're
 
00:59:44.029 --> 00:59:44.039 align:start position:0%
marginalized you don't have the same
 
00:59:46.109 --> 00:59:46.119 align:start position:0%
voice commensurate with the impact that
 
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
you are going to
 
00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
face and I don't know if I'm being clear
 
00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
about that but I yes there's
 
00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
notification I think I think the bigger
 
00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:58.109 align:start position:0%
notification I think I think the bigger
issue

00:59:58.109 --> 00:59:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
is make my voice meaningful give it
 
01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:05.480 align:start position:0%
weight don't just make it a formality
 
01:00:08.349 --> 01:00:08.359 align:start position:0%
don't make it yes we had the public
 
01:00:08.359 --> 01:00:10.190 align:start position:0%
don't make it yes we had the public
hearing

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
check I I don't even think and and I
 
01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
look I respect Dees they have a very
 
01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:17.950 align:start position:0%
look I respect Dees they have a very
difficult

01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:17.960 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
job but we don't even get feedback we
 
01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:24.200 align:start position:0%
don't get we disagree with your voice
 
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
with what you said we don't say that's a
 
01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
great idea we get nothing we get we get
 
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
silence and that's very
 
01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
demoralizing uh to people that take the
 
01:00:39.789 --> 01:00:39.799 align:start position:0%
time and energy and effort and put their
 
01:00:41.549 --> 01:00:41.559 align:start position:0%
heart and soul into trying to protect
 
01:00:41.559 --> 01:00:42.430 align:start position:0%
heart and soul into trying to protect
their

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:00:45.029 --> 01:00:45.039 align:start position:0%
Homestead and there's things there's
 
01:00:47.789 --> 01:00:47.799 align:start position:0%
just things that are wrong so I I only
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
step forward and again I I I I haven't
 
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
prepared comments for this but um you
 
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
know I I think I think the I think the
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
logical thing is to focus this on new
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
landfills and to think about the intent
 
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
of the bill which is to make sure people
 
01:01:07.549 --> 01:01:07.559 align:start position:0%
who are going to be impacted actually
 
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
have a say in what
 
01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:13.720 align:start position:0%
happens okay thank you representative H
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
Haskins and then representative M chair
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
and and thank you for taking my question
 
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
so I think what I understand from what
 
01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
you're saying is that if let's say the
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
applicant was asked to come to a
 
01:01:33.789 --> 01:01:33.799 align:start position:0%
planning board meeting that's not Dalton
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
for instance they can choose not to come
 
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
right so is that not a loophole in the
 
01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
system when you're trying to get your
 
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.589 align:start position:0%
system when you're trying to get your
voice

01:01:44.589 --> 01:01:44.599 align:start position:0%
voice
 
01:01:47.029 --> 01:01:47.039 align:start position:0%
heard yeah I mean I I think at the end
 
01:01:48.029 --> 01:01:48.039 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:01:48.039 --> 01:01:49.670 align:start position:0%
of the
day

01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
businesses do what they are told to do
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
so if the law says you have to meet with
 
01:01:57.789 --> 01:01:57.799 align:start position:0%
the Dalton select board then you meet
 
01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
with the do Dalton select board and to
 
01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
the extent that they are not forced to
 
01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:05.240 align:start position:0%
do that they will not do do that either
 
01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
um what I'm saying is these are these
 
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
are Big impactful
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
projects and it's not good what we're
 
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
doing today is lacking in terms of the
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
voice and the commensurate opportunity
 
01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
to um have a say in what's really going
 
01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:29.240 align:start position:0%
to be very impactful to your town to
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
your property to your quality of life
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what the bill is
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
intended to do I I you know I think
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
there's there's amendments or there's
 
01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
changes that need to be made I'm just
 
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
encouraging you to to don't give up on
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
it it's it's something that's worthwhile
 
01:02:44.589 --> 01:02:44.599 align:start position:0%
and meaningful to Citizens thank you
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskin uh Howard I'm
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you madam chair and I'm so
 
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
glad you came in today Mr Morrison
 
01:02:54.029 --> 01:02:54.039 align:start position:0%
because I think that um you have pointed
 
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
out the biggest weakness in this bill
 
01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
which is you get a hearing but do you
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
really have influence does it is there
 
01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
are they is this a promise of of results
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
from your hearing um I it seems to me
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
that there's a possibility that you know
 
01:03:09.549 --> 01:03:09.559 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people could come from all
 
01:03:12.029 --> 01:03:12.039 align:start position:0%
over the region from the whole Watershed
 
01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:13.960 align:start position:0%
and have their voices heard and not have
 
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
anything happen as a
 
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
result do you agree with me yeah I I I I
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
think I think I don't want to be I don't
 
01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
want to be negative I think a lot of
 
01:03:26.349 --> 01:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
these things are well intended but I
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
don't think I don't think we want please
 
01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
don't put any more bureaucracy in place
 
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:33.039 align:start position:0%
don't don't make it a formality don't
 
01:03:36.269 --> 01:03:36.279 align:start position:0%
ask waste companies to have a meeting if
 
01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:38.359 align:start position:0%
it's not really going to accomplish
 
01:03:41.309 --> 01:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
anything but I do think as a citizen and
 
01:03:43.829 --> 01:03:43.839 align:start position:0%
having been involved in in this thing
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
these are Big projects big impact long
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
range uh you know it doesn't go away in
 
01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
a week or a month or a year you're
 
01:03:53.549 --> 01:03:53.559 align:start position:0%
living with this for decades so giving
 
01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:55.240 align:start position:0%
people and surrounding towns that are
 
01:03:57.069 --> 01:03:57.079 align:start position:0%
going to be significantly impacted for
 
01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
this they should have a a strong voice
 
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
and somehow or other they they the
 
01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
impacts that they're feeling should be
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
part of the decision process about
 
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
whether the project goes forward or not
 
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
and I think it's far broader than that
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
plot of land that physical you know
 
01:04:19.269 --> 01:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
piece of a town where it's going to sit
 
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire is a small
 
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:26.200 align:start position:0%
State uh you know acre landfill doesn't
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
just affect this the one town it sits in
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
it it affects a far broader group of
 
01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:34.269 align:start position:0%
it it affects a far broader group of
people

01:04:34.269 --> 01:04:34.279 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:04:38.589 --> 01:04:38.599 align:start position:0%
so represent Bixby yeah so um you said
 
01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
that uh that as as a resident of
 
01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:45.640 align:start position:0%
Whitefield uh you received notices of
 
01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
the meetings and I would assume that
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
people in Bethlehem would also have
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
received notice I'm wondering about uh
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
where people who were two or three towns
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh Downstream or upstream and I I don't
 
01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
know the I don't know the the geography
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
of that particular area so I can't name
 
01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:05.079 align:start position:0%
particular towns but are were people who
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
were two or three towns away but uh
 
01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
still within the Watershed uh or within
 
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
say a 10 15 mile radius getting notices
 
01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:15.640 align:start position:0%
or were those towns getting notices or
 
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
was it just the immediately abing towns
 
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I I'm going to plead ignorance I I
 
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:24.200 align:start position:0%
I can't in truth answer that completely
 
01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
I know that the surrounding towns uh
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
were aware of the meeting and and showed
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
up in droves but how far that periphery
 
01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
went I I couldn't tell you and I also
 
01:05:36.269 --> 01:05:36.279 align:start position:0%
the the complexity of this too
 
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
is um Dees doesn't deal in traffic
 
01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
issues for example that's the Department
 
01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:42.829 align:start position:0%
issues for example that's the Department
of

01:05:42.829 --> 01:05:42.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:05:42.839 --> 01:05:44.829 align:start position:0%
of
Transportation

01:05:44.829 --> 01:05:44.839 align:start position:0%
Transportation
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
so just I don't mean to take up a lot of
 
01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
your time when you when we think about
 
01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
the proposal in in Dalton that's 100
 
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
trash Halls 100 trucks in and out of
 
01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
little New Hampshire towns that you know
 
01:05:59.230 --> 01:05:59.240 align:start position:0%
that are not built for those kind of
 
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
vehicles going through little you know
 
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
uh intersections and so even though
 
01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
you're you're not uh you know the the
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
dees control of the I don't know the the
 
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
the science and the and the toxins and
 
01:06:16.349 --> 01:06:16.359 align:start position:0%
the leade and all the rest of it there
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
are other extenuating circumstances that
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
impact towns Whitefield is a I don't
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
know 2500 people um it's a rural town
 
01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:31.480 align:start position:0%
and you know as people think about big
 
01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
trash hallers making sharp turns and
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
going into and out of the
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
landfill that's going to have a really
 
01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:38.750 align:start position:0%
landfill that's going to have a really
big

01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
big
 
01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
impact and um you know I'm not
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
sure that in the way in the in the
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
decision process of yes or no from Dees
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
how does that get weighed in I don't
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
think it
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
does representative H
 
01:06:58.589 --> 01:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
Haskins Mr Morrison thank you madam
 
01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
chair why did you form the North Country
 
01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
Alliance for balanced
 
01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
change um the truth is the the the
 
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
organization that I'm now president of
 
01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
was started about uh almost 15 years ago
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
and it started with a different land use
 
01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:19.799 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how much detail we
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
should get into but um somebody wanted
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
to do something with a big track of land
 
01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:26.839 align:start position:0%
actually the same land now that's being
 
01:07:28.349 --> 01:07:28.359 align:start position:0%
considered for a landfill was going to
 
01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:32.359 align:start position:0%
be a drag strip and if you group of
 
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
homeowners got together and said wow TR
 
01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
sound travels far and fast um what does
 
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
that really mean so the group kind of
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
started with the idea and by the way
 
01:07:45.069 --> 01:07:45.079 align:start position:0%
we're not just about trying to kill
 
01:07:47.269 --> 01:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
projects we're trying to promote
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
positive things for you know we recently
 
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
were actively supporting um a solar
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
project for homeowners in the North
 
01:07:57.630 --> 01:07:57.640 align:start position:0%
Country to be able to kind of band
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
together and you know so we're we're
 
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
trying to balance the economic interests
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
and and the Environmental Protections
 
01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
that we think are critical to in the
 
01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
North Country it's all about tourism
 
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
that drives most of our industry most of
 
01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:11.710 align:start position:0%
that drives most of our industry most of
our

01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:08:14.269 --> 01:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
livelihoods so we started to protect
 
01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:17.480 align:start position:0%
that and U so as we've gotten more
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
involved we've gotten a you know this is
 
01:08:22.510 --> 01:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
the last place I ever thought I'd be
 
01:08:25.349 --> 01:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
sitting you and as I retired from work
 
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
to be sitting in front of the
 
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture committee
 
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
talking about solid waste because I knew
 
01:08:34.030 --> 01:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
nothing about it and um you know five
 
01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
years in it's all different well we
 
01:08:37.829 --> 01:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming um hope you uh do
 
01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:39.640 align:start position:0%

01:09:06.749 --> 01:09:06.759 align:start position:0%
it thank
 
01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
you um thank you Madame chair members of
 
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is John tutill I'm
 
01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
from aworth um just very very briefly uh
 
01:09:17.149 --> 01:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
listening to this discussion I think one
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
important piece here is to consider the
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
role of planning boards zoning boards of
 
01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
adjustment and just the general planning
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
process in small
 
01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
communities um I think that once you get
 
01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
a designation of uh development of
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
regional impact at that point you've got
 
01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
the support of regional planning
 
01:09:35.149 --> 01:09:35.159 align:start position:0%
commissions or I think in the north it
 
01:09:37.229 --> 01:09:37.239 align:start position:0%
would be the North Country Council they
 
01:09:40.149 --> 01:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
have resources they have some expertise
 
01:09:43.149 --> 01:09:43.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of the transportation issues um
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
so I would strongly urge passage of this
 
01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
bill and I think it is a good idea
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps to simplify it but just provide
 
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
this extra opportunity for ab budding
 
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
communities to participate in a formal
 
01:09:56.910 --> 01:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
process through the planning boards
 
01:09:59.669 --> 01:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any
 
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none anyone else who
 
01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:03.880 align:start position:0%

as their letter in support of the bill
 
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:29.440 align:start position:0%

01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:28.709 align:start position:0%
 
McKenna

01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:30.280 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair members of the
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
council for the record my name is Leah
 
01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
McKenna and I am the administrator of
 
01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
the solid waste management Bureau at the
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
today um on
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
1490 as representative eel stated this
 
01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
was a bill that was uh proposed by the
 
01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
department and it is indeed to intended
 
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
to clarify a number of well for uh items
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
that are currently in the solid was
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
statute 149
 
01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:01.480 align:start position:0%
M so I'm going to take a couple of
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
minutes now to explain each of those
 
01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:04.910 align:start position:0%
minutes now to explain each of those
four

01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
items first the bill seeks to amend the
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
existing statutory definition of a
 
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
butter currently that definition is any
 
01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
person who owns property adjacent to or
 
01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
across a road railroad or stream from
 
01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:21.400 align:start position:0%
the property on which a solid waste
 
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
facility may be permitted
 
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
so in a butter used in the context of
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
the statute and the administrative rules
 
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh is afforded a number of notifications
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
for a number of steps that are involved
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
in the permitting process landfills
 
01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
transfer stations um recycling
 
01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:38.189 align:start position:0%
transfer stations um recycling
facilities

01:13:38.189 --> 01:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:13:42.189 --> 01:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
compost um so for example one of those
 
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
notifications might be an applicant
 
01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
wishing to propose a new solid waste
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
facility they're required by rule to
 
01:13:49.709 --> 01:13:49.719 align:start position:0%
notify a Butters of certain information
 
01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
about that facility um another example
 
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
is the requirement to not notify a
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
Butters of any public hearing that's
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
required by Statute or rule so we
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
believe that amending the existing
 
01:14:03.149 --> 01:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
definition to include Property Owners
 
01:14:05.709 --> 01:14:05.719 align:start position:0%
located across a utility Corridor or a
 
01:14:07.229 --> 01:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
water course would allow for more
 
01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
inclusivity for the universe of parties
 
01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
who receive these notifications and can
 
01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:12.520 align:start position:0%
then decide whether or not they want to
 
01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
participate in the process of public
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
hearings next the bill would clarify the
 
01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
existing definition of endof Life motor
 
01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
vehicle and that would be by stating
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
that the term motor vehicle is as
 
01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA
 
01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
25960 which is the state's motor vehicle
 
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
statute third the bill provides explicit
 
01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
Authority currently for or I apologize
 
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
the proposed Bill provides explicit
 
01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:42.280 align:start position:0%
Authority for Dees to terminate permits
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
when a facility closes the facility and
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
no longer intends to conduct the
 
01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:48.510 align:start position:0%
no longer intends to conduct the
permitted

01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
permitted
 
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
activity right now the statute provides
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
that permits are continuous in duration
 
01:14:55.149 --> 01:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
and that presents a challenge to us when
 
01:14:57.629 --> 01:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
a facility physically closes they cease
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
all activity but yet the permit by
 
01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
Statute is considered continuous in in
 
01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
duration what we're hoping is this will
 
01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
this will provide us an ability to to
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
formally terminate a permit without
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
having to go through a suspension or
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
revocation process which is really not
 
01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
needed in in these
 
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
cases and then lastly the bill corrects
 
01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
a drafting error dating back to the 2019
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
legislative session which was part of uh
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 163
 
01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
that bill amended timelines for review
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
of solid waste permit applications in
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
RSA 149 M9 Roman 8 but the bill failed
 
01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
to amend the corresponding language in
 
01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:39.400 align:start position:0%
RSA 149 M12 Roman 3 to reflect this
 
01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
change so this amendment just corrects
 
01:15:41.159 --> 01:15:42.990 align:start position:0%
change so this amendment just corrects
that

01:15:42.990 --> 01:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
Omission that's what I have for you at
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
the T at this moment uh thank you very
 
01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
much for allowing us to provide
 
01:15:49.709 --> 01:15:49.719 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'm happy to answer any
 
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative Bixby yeah so
 
01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
under the current Cent uh uh wording of
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
stream uh I'm going to just use an examp
 
01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
um Waste Management in TurnKey as an
 
01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
example so uh their Pro their property
 
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
goes up to the ice and glass river right
 
01:16:12.030 --> 01:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
would someone under current under the
 
01:16:14.629 --> 01:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
current uh phrasing would someone who
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
was across the ice and glass River be
 
01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
not considered in a butter correct
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
because that would be because right now
 
01:16:24.189 --> 01:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
what it has in our unnecessarily
 
01:16:26.590 --> 01:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
narrowed to stream only and so an
 
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
applicant can say the Isen glass river
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
is not a stream therefore um we know we
 
01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't consider them in a butter so
 
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
this is this is meant meant to increase
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
um that from from a stream to a river a
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
canal uh another another form of a
 
01:16:43.149 --> 01:16:43.159 align:start position:0%
channel thank you
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
sure any other questions from the
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
committee represent Duty just um the
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
word water course is one word and and
 
01:16:57.550 --> 01:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with that word it's not
 
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
supposed to be two words I've seen it
 
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
I've seen it both way okay and a water
 
01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:05.960 align:start position:0%
course just means any type of water
 
01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
water water running through a channel
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
okay yeah thank you it's not not not the
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
not Lake Waki okay water running through
 
01:17:15.310 --> 01:17:15.320 align:start position:0%
a channel okay thank you
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
sure any other questions from the
 
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very

much thank
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
you and I wonder from the committee
 
01:17:28.350 --> 01:17:28.360 align:start position:0%
seeing as this is pretty straightforward
 
01:17:31.709 --> 01:17:31.719 align:start position:0%
um cleanup language of the
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
statutes I wonder if there is any
 
01:17:37.390 --> 01:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
objection for us to even uh consider
 
01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
executing this bill at this time
 
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby I would be in favor
 
01:17:45.550 --> 01:17:45.560 align:start position:0%
of executing it s
 
01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
OTP we need to close out this yeah right
 
01:17:50.189 --> 01:17:50.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not moving that I'm just
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
saying that I would be willing to
 
01:17:54.189 --> 01:17:54.199 align:start position:0%
execute so that just clarify that so let
 
01:17:58.270 --> 01:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
me get the blue sheet uh for this bill
 
01:18:00.189 --> 01:18:00.199 align:start position:0%
since there any other folks that would
 
01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
like to speak on this represent um sorry
 
01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:07.510 align:start position:0%
like to speak on this represent um sorry
Mr

01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:09.310 align:start position:0%
 
POI

01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
POI
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
St Steve py with Waste Management y I'm
 
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
uh we don't hold a position on this bill
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify something that
 
01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
was exchanged earlier um we do notify
 
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
folks that are cross the river we've
 
01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
done that for over 20 years that is our
 
01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
interpretation of an a butter I think
 
01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
the rule clarification makes that
 
01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
clearer um I can see where someone may
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
argue that someone's an aob butter in
 
01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
that case but we've been doing that for
 
01:18:40.110 --> 01:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
for many years so that's all I have
 
01:18:41.629 --> 01:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for your additional comment

1490 and I
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%

explained pretty clearly why these uh
 
01:20:02.189 --> 01:20:02.199 align:start position:0%
small changes to law are sensible and
 
01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
necessary and I think we should just do
 
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%

03:03:44.229 --> 03:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
13
 
03:03:48.910 --> 03:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
uh representing portions of Dover uh and
 
03:03:48.920 --> 03:03:50.990 align:start position:0%
uh representing portions of Dover uh and
uh

03:03:50.990 --> 03:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:03:55.309 --> 03:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
so uh this bill uh I I put this bill in
 
03:03:57.630 --> 03:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
initially because I thought that
 
03:03:59.429 --> 03:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
something like this needed to go in and
 
03:04:01.990 --> 03:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
I was hoping that a more extensive bill
 
03:04:06.469 --> 03:04:06.479 align:start position:0%
would come out of the um the uh study
 
03:04:08.790 --> 03:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
committee on unlimited service areas and
 
03:04:11.710 --> 03:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
out of state waste uh the main purpose
 
03:04:13.990 --> 03:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
my main motivation for bringing this
 
03:04:17.030 --> 03:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
bill is uh because New Hampshire
 
03:04:19.910 --> 03:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
landfills get an awful lot of
 
03:04:25.550 --> 03:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
uh of waste from out of state and uh for
 
03:04:29.269 --> 03:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
the landfills that are privately owned
 
03:04:31.710 --> 03:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
uh there is
 
03:04:36.710 --> 03:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
um the uh current a fairly standard
 
03:04:39.269 --> 03:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the law is that the
 
03:04:43.590 --> 03:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
state cannot limit uh the how much of of
 
03:04:46.590 --> 03:04:46.600 align:start position:0%
that out ofate waste they choose to uh
 
03:04:50.030 --> 03:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
take uh as long as the if the
 
03:04:52.550 --> 03:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
limitations are not exactly the same
 
03:04:55.750 --> 03:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
between instate and out of state waste
 
03:04:58.790 --> 03:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh and it occurred to me that the key
 
03:05:03.070 --> 03:05:03.080 align:start position:0%
problem was that we have uh um private
 
03:05:05.870 --> 03:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
landfills that we just can't control how
 
03:05:08.030 --> 03:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
much of that of the outstate waste is
 
03:05:11.269 --> 03:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
coming in if we moved our our landfills
 
03:05:13.870 --> 03:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
to being public then we would have
 
03:05:15.590 --> 03:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
complete control over that so for
 
03:05:19.630 --> 03:05:19.640 align:start position:0%
instance nashaa and Lebanon uh do not
 
03:05:22.750 --> 03:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
have to take any uh waste from out of
 
03:05:24.870 --> 03:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
state because they are entirely
 
03:05:27.110 --> 03:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
controlled by those
 
03:05:29.630 --> 03:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh they can choose to I
 
03:05:31.349 --> 03:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
believe that Lebanon takes some waste
 
03:05:34.389 --> 03:05:34.399 align:start position:0%
from uh communities just across the the
 
03:05:38.790 --> 03:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
Vermont border uh so the basic idea is
 
03:05:42.950 --> 03:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
that uh Land by making landfills in the
 
03:05:45.550 --> 03:05:45.560 align:start position:0%
state public we would be able to control
 
03:05:49.030 --> 03:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
the out of state waste and
 
03:05:54.030 --> 03:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
uh so um the study committee came back
 
03:05:56.110 --> 03:05:56.120 align:start position:0%
and said we really like your bill we
 
03:05:58.389 --> 03:05:58.399 align:start position:0%
think it makes a lot of sense so let's
 
03:06:00.469 --> 03:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
just go let it go in like that but we we
 
03:06:04.030 --> 03:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
have a couple of suggestions uh and uh
 
03:06:05.190 --> 03:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
actually one of these suggestions was
 
03:06:07.469 --> 03:06:07.479 align:start position:0%
something I I'd also thought of which is
 
03:06:09.710 --> 03:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to make sure that we
 
03:06:12.190 --> 03:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
grandfathered existing private landfills
 
03:06:17.110 --> 03:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
because um we we don't want to uh put um
 
03:06:21.429 --> 03:06:21.439 align:start position:0%
TurnKey out of business for instance um
 
03:06:25.510 --> 03:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
so uh there is a uh fairly there there
 
03:06:27.790 --> 03:06:27.800 align:start position:0%
the grandfathering Clause is basically
 
03:06:30.070 --> 03:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
what we have prepared for some other
 
03:06:35.030 --> 03:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
bills and we discussed that with uh uh
 
03:06:39.030 --> 03:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
with uh a representative from TurnKey so
 
03:06:40.830 --> 03:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
we know that that is something that
 
03:06:42.590 --> 03:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
would cover private landfills fairly
 
03:06:42.600 --> 03:06:43.830 align:start position:0%
would cover private landfills fairly
effectively

03:06:43.830 --> 03:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
03:06:44.750 --> 03:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
03:06:47.790 --> 03:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
other um the other thing that was
 
03:06:51.510 --> 03:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
suggested was that for uh landfills that
 
03:06:54.229 --> 03:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
are owned by the state it would make
 
03:06:56.550 --> 03:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
sense to require that those be managed
 
03:07:00.349 --> 03:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
and operated by a private business uh so
 
03:07:01.870 --> 03:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
that the state would not be in the
 
03:07:03.630 --> 03:07:03.640 align:start position:0%
business of figuring out how to run a
 
03:07:05.830 --> 03:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
landfill they would be uh they would
 
03:07:08.429 --> 03:07:08.439 align:start position:0%
have the ownership but not the
 
03:07:12.190 --> 03:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
operational require um uh
 
03:07:14.070 --> 03:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and they would simply
 
03:07:16.110 --> 03:07:16.120 align:start position:0%
oversee those they would oversee the
 
03:07:18.550 --> 03:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
operation but they would not uh be in
 
03:07:19.910 --> 03:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
charge of the
 
03:07:22.110 --> 03:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
operation uh
 
03:07:24.870 --> 03:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
so uh so that's basically what the bill
 
03:07:28.750 --> 03:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
does uh it oh and for the municipal and
 
03:07:32.950 --> 03:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
county level uh the the subdivisions can
 
03:07:36.030 --> 03:07:36.040 align:start position:0%
choose whether they want to uh have a
 
03:07:39.269 --> 03:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
private contractor run the operation or
 
03:07:40.990 --> 03:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
whether they want to run it themselves I
 
03:07:44.269 --> 03:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
believe that most of our uh our
 
03:07:47.070 --> 03:07:47.080 align:start position:0%
Municipal uh landfills are currently run
 
03:07:48.750 --> 03:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
by those
 
03:07:52.070 --> 03:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
subdivisions uh so that's basically what
 
03:07:55.830 --> 03:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
the bill does and uh a couple of
 
03:07:59.070 --> 03:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
comments have come up in terms of uh
 
03:08:01.469 --> 03:08:01.479 align:start position:0%
What uh would this in some way be anti-b
 
03:08:05.670 --> 03:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
business uh and I don't think so because
 
03:08:08.349 --> 03:08:08.359 align:start position:0%
uh by requiring a landfill at the state
 
03:08:11.309 --> 03:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
level to be uh operated by a private
 
03:08:13.070 --> 03:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
business that is actually creating a
 
03:08:15.630 --> 03:08:15.640 align:start position:0%
great opportunity and it takes a certain
 
03:08:17.389 --> 03:08:17.399 align:start position:0%
number of the difficulties off that
 
03:08:19.990 --> 03:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
business off that management business's
 
03:08:22.190 --> 03:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
plate they don't need to find the site
 
03:08:24.269 --> 03:08:24.279 align:start position:0%
they don't need to buy the site they
 
03:08:29.030 --> 03:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
don't need to they don't need to um be
 
03:08:31.269 --> 03:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
they don't need to decide whether the
 
03:08:34.229 --> 03:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
site is appropriate uh th those are
 
03:08:37.150 --> 03:08:37.160 align:start position:0%
things that the state would take on and
 
03:08:40.389 --> 03:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
uh the but the private so those things
 
03:08:42.150 --> 03:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
would would so it would be actually an
 
03:08:43.830 --> 03:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
advantage to a private business to take
 
03:08:46.229 --> 03:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
on the running of such a u public
 
03:08:51.070 --> 03:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
landfill um the other thing is the costs
 
03:08:52.469 --> 03:08:52.479 align:start position:0%
whether there would whether this would
 
03:08:58.269 --> 03:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease costs for uh for uh
 
03:09:02.110 --> 03:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
uh communities who uh have to ship their
 
03:09:05.429 --> 03:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
uh trash to you know some landfill
 
03:09:08.070 --> 03:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
somewhere and uh there was some
 
03:09:10.110 --> 03:09:10.120 align:start position:0%
suggestion that it might increase costs
 
03:09:11.309 --> 03:09:11.319 align:start position:0%
however one of the things that was
 
03:09:13.670 --> 03:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
brought up was the transportation issue
 
03:09:17.870 --> 03:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
and at the moment the current landfills
 
03:09:20.030 --> 03:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
in the state that are privately run are
 
03:09:22.070 --> 03:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
located in places that are actually not
 
03:09:24.910 --> 03:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
that convenient to much of the State uh
 
03:09:28.070 --> 03:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
the state could decide that uh they
 
03:09:30.269 --> 03:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
would choose a landfill site that was
 
03:09:34.750 --> 03:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
more conveniently located to more of the
 
03:09:38.070 --> 03:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
population and uh therefore reduce the
 
03:09:40.870 --> 03:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
trans the transportation costs the
 
03:09:44.550 --> 03:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal note does mention that that uh
 
03:09:47.030 --> 03:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
currently the Tipping fees at private
 
03:09:49.110 --> 03:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
landfills are higher than the current
 
03:09:50.870 --> 03:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
than the Tipping fees at Municipal
 
03:09:53.309 --> 03:09:53.319 align:start position:0%
landfills so uh that's also an
 
03:09:55.269 --> 03:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
indication of where the costs might run
 
03:09:57.710 --> 03:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
there um so that's about as much as I
 
03:09:59.070 --> 03:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
have I'd be willing to take some
 
03:10:01.550 --> 03:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
questions but uh we do have someone who
 
03:10:04.750 --> 03:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
was on that Solid Waste uh uh out of
 
03:10:07.670 --> 03:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
state solid out of state and Lim
 
03:10:11.670 --> 03:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
unlimited um uh service area study
 
03:10:13.349 --> 03:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
committee who is going to be
 
03:10:16.830 --> 03:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
testifying uh and I would probably defer
 
03:10:19.389 --> 03:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
most of the questions to him because uh
 
03:10:21.070 --> 03:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
he has studied this much more carefully
 
03:10:25.349 --> 03:10:25.359 align:start position:0%
than I have I do have a question do we
 
03:10:28.070 --> 03:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
know if any other states do this uh
 
03:10:31.910 --> 03:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
Maine does this I uh I I know that Maine
 
03:10:33.910 --> 03:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
does it I'm pretty sure that Vermont
 
03:10:38.229 --> 03:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
does it uh and I'm I'm fairly sure that
 
03:10:40.429 --> 03:10:40.439 align:start position:0%
there are others out there uh I don't I
 
03:10:42.309 --> 03:10:42.319 align:start position:0%
don't have a complete list I think that
 
03:10:43.550 --> 03:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
might be some something that
 
03:10:46.349 --> 03:10:46.359 align:start position:0%
representative ger could answer more um
 
03:10:50.750 --> 03:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
more fully so and also by doing
 
03:10:54.309 --> 03:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
this would then the legislature be the
 
03:10:58.349 --> 03:10:58.359 align:start position:0%
one that determines some sort of level
 
03:10:58.359 --> 03:10:59.389 align:start position:0%
one that determines some sort of level
of

03:10:59.389 --> 03:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:11:02.429 --> 03:11:02.439 align:start position:0%
percentage of uh how much solid waste
 
03:11:04.550 --> 03:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
comes in from out of state the
 
03:11:07.670 --> 03:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
legislature would be uh would be able to
 
03:11:10.030 --> 03:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
do that uh it is something that we could
 
03:11:13.710 --> 03:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
either do uh on a legislative basis or
 
03:11:16.389 --> 03:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
we could do it as part as or we could
 
03:11:18.349 --> 03:11:18.359 align:start position:0%
put it in as part of the rules making
 
03:11:21.910 --> 03:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
process but we would it would be um the
 
03:11:23.630 --> 03:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
the state would have control of that
 
03:11:26.229 --> 03:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
whether whether it would be the through
 
03:11:28.070 --> 03:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
the legislative branch or through the
 
03:11:30.710 --> 03:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
executive branch so would you imagine
 
03:11:33.670 --> 03:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner of uh Department
 
03:11:35.110 --> 03:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
of Environmental
 
03:11:37.670 --> 03:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
Services be the one that determine some
 
03:11:41.429 --> 03:11:41.439 align:start position:0%
sort of out of state percentage level uh
 
03:11:44.150 --> 03:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know exactly how that would work
 
03:11:45.710 --> 03:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
03:11:48.030 --> 03:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
03:11:49.389 --> 03:11:49.399 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:11:52.309 --> 03:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
question I have uh at least one question
 
03:11:55.670 --> 03:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
around whether or not you see this piece
 
03:11:57.550 --> 03:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
of legislation potentially being
 
03:11:59.190 --> 03:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
something that could be considered a
 
03:12:02.910 --> 03:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:07.309 --> 03:12:07.319 align:start position:0%
sorts I don't think this falls under the
 
03:12:09.590 --> 03:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
scope of what is considered public
 
03:12:11.309 --> 03:12:11.319 align:start position:0%
utility because a public public
 
03:12:13.070 --> 03:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
utilities are generally think things
 
03:12:18.070 --> 03:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
that are functioning as um as structural
 
03:12:22.389 --> 03:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
monopolies uh and so that um so for
 
03:12:24.309 --> 03:12:24.319 align:start position:0%
instance uh
 
03:12:26.990 --> 03:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
electricity that's a public utility
 
03:12:30.469 --> 03:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
because it's you can't have multiple
 
03:12:33.190 --> 03:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
competing uh it it's just structurally
 
03:12:35.710 --> 03:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
not possible to do that however if
 
03:12:37.550 --> 03:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
someone knows more about utility law
 
03:12:39.990 --> 03:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
than I do I would not I I'd be willing
 
03:12:43.229 --> 03:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
to see that argument so um that's just a
 
03:12:44.830 --> 03:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
guess I don't know for certain and
 
03:12:48.389 --> 03:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
followup y followup and then with regard
 
03:12:50.590 --> 03:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
to I would imagine rfps and bids for
 
03:12:54.110 --> 03:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
proposals would Dees rules be the person
 
03:12:56.510 --> 03:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
do you think developing or negotiating
 
03:12:58.790 --> 03:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
third party management
 
03:13:01.790 --> 03:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
structure yes it might require further
 
03:13:05.590 --> 03:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
legislation to um to to to put that into
 
03:13:09.070 --> 03:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
operation but uh but in term
 
03:13:12.070 --> 03:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
but Dees would be the appropriate
 
03:13:12.080 --> 03:13:13.190 align:start position:0%
but Dees would be the appropriate
location

03:13:13.190 --> 03:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
location
 
03:13:17.830 --> 03:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
to uh put out an RFP for the management
 
03:13:19.389 --> 03:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
of a of a
 
03:13:21.710 --> 03:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
landfill okay representative
 
03:13:24.269 --> 03:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
Howard if the bill is enacted thank you
 
03:13:26.630 --> 03:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
madam chairman if the bill is enacted
 
03:13:30.190 --> 03:13:30.200 align:start position:0%
would it uh preclude um a passage of any
 
03:13:31.990 --> 03:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
permits that are in the
 
03:13:36.269 --> 03:13:36.279 align:start position:0%
works I do not know I believe that the
 
03:13:38.750 --> 03:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice is still figuring
 
03:13:42.510 --> 03:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
out uh what the status of of current
 
03:13:45.990 --> 03:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
Curr ly proposed U permits are is
 
03:13:48.070 --> 03:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
relative to all of this all all the
 
03:13:49.790 --> 03:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
various bills we're dealing
 
03:13:52.429 --> 03:13:52.439 align:start position:0%
with representative
 
03:13:54.750 --> 03:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
com thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:13:57.830 --> 03:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question my
 
03:14:01.830 --> 03:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
question becomes if at some point uh the
 
03:14:04.710 --> 03:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
existing landfills run out of capacity
 
03:14:07.150 --> 03:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
and I've heard some interesting
 
03:14:07.160 --> 03:14:08.510 align:start position:0%
and I've heard some interesting
conversation

03:14:08.510 --> 03:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
03:14:12.790 --> 03:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
today um would the state be able to take
 
03:14:16.190 --> 03:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:22.429 --> 03:14:22.439 align:start position:0%
this uh I I don't know what the
 
03:14:26.269 --> 03:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know what the I don't know
 
03:14:28.590 --> 03:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
enough about em eminent domain law in
 
03:14:31.309 --> 03:14:31.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to give you a definitive
 
03:14:36.870 --> 03:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
answer my I I have a big recollection of
 
03:14:39.910 --> 03:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
having passed a bill seever a number of
 
03:14:42.830 --> 03:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
years ago that severely restricted the
 
03:14:45.229 --> 03:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
state's capacity to use evident do
 
03:14:48.190 --> 03:14:48.200 align:start position:0%
domain but I I don't know enough of that
 
03:14:50.190 --> 03:14:50.200 align:start position:0%
about that portion of law to to say
 
03:14:53.070 --> 03:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
repres come to our followup yes and
 
03:14:54.469 --> 03:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
thank you and I understand you don't
 
03:14:56.510 --> 03:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
know enough about um the eminent domain
 
03:14:59.030 --> 03:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
law but I do believe that it states that
 
03:15:00.910 --> 03:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
if it's for the welfare of the entire
 
03:15:03.349 --> 03:15:03.359 align:start position:0%
State then they can do the taking and I
 
03:15:05.830 --> 03:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
would be concerned uh that some language
 
03:15:07.750 --> 03:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
would need to be drafted into something
 
03:15:09.950 --> 03:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
like this that say land cannot be taken
 
03:15:11.150 --> 03:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
by emminent
 
03:15:15.269 --> 03:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
domain if if if there's a um desire to
 
03:15:17.710 --> 03:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
have an amendment that would uh that
 
03:15:19.910 --> 03:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
would indicate that I'd be happy to add
 
03:15:21.429 --> 03:15:21.439 align:start position:0%
that because I'm not crazy about the
 
03:15:23.950 --> 03:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
idea of an eminent do domain okay
 
03:15:23.960 --> 03:15:25.590 align:start position:0%
idea of an eminent do domain okay
representative

03:15:25.590 --> 03:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:15:29.349 --> 03:15:29.359 align:start position:0%
kraton thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:15:31.630 --> 03:15:31.640 align:start position:0%
you representative Bixby a followup to
 
03:15:34.790 --> 03:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
that question then is let's say we need
 
03:15:38.150 --> 03:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
a new land site they the gentleman this
 
03:15:41.269 --> 03:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
morning said his site was 1500 Acres
 
03:15:43.469 --> 03:15:43.479 align:start position:0%
we've heard 100 acres so somewhere
 
03:15:48.630 --> 03:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
between 115 acres 100 and 1500 Acres the
 
03:15:51.189 --> 03:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
state then has to buy that and so I
 
03:15:54.750 --> 03:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
don't see that in the financial note
 
03:15:58.070 --> 03:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
saying okay this is a a lot of land that
 
03:16:00.389 --> 03:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
the state is
 
03:16:03.790 --> 03:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
buying so the the question I I I believe
 
03:16:05.990 --> 03:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
that the question of the actual purchase
 
03:16:07.790 --> 03:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
of the land would have to be something
 
03:16:10.189 --> 03:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
that would be subject to further
 
03:16:12.870 --> 03:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
legislation uh and um
 
03:16:14.590 --> 03:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
and in terms of the details of how that
 
03:16:17.790 --> 03:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
would be worked out it would have um and
 
03:16:21.389 --> 03:16:21.399 align:start position:0%
it may come through as um as a budget
 
03:16:24.349 --> 03:16:24.359 align:start position:0%
request from Dees if they recognize the
 
03:16:27.670 --> 03:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
need to purchase land uh it was it's
 
03:16:29.670 --> 03:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
something that the legislature would
 
03:16:32.830 --> 03:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
certainly have the capacity to weigh in
 
03:16:35.910 --> 03:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
on before uh before new land was
 
03:16:38.150 --> 03:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
purchased it is also possible that are
 
03:16:40.750 --> 03:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
there are lands owned by the state
 
03:16:43.229 --> 03:16:43.239 align:start position:0%
currently that would be appropriate for
 
03:16:45.790 --> 03:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
the purpose and
 
03:16:49.550 --> 03:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh and that is you know that is you know
 
03:16:51.469 --> 03:16:51.479 align:start position:0%
that's a guess I don't I I I couldn't
 
03:16:53.229 --> 03:16:53.239 align:start position:0%
say well there's this lot there's this
 
03:16:55.670 --> 03:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
lot in you know such and such a town
 
03:16:59.389 --> 03:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
that would work um but uh there may be
 
03:17:01.150 --> 03:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate land that's already owned by
 
03:17:02.429 --> 03:17:02.439 align:start position:0%
the state in which case it would not
 
03:17:03.830 --> 03:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
require a new
 
03:17:06.750 --> 03:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
purchase represent H Haskins thank you
 
03:17:08.510 --> 03:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you representative
 
03:17:12.469 --> 03:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
for taking my um question I I've heard
 
03:17:14.510 --> 03:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
some different numbers being thrown
 
03:17:16.750 --> 03:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
around for acreage but is it not true
 
03:17:20.110 --> 03:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:24.349 --> 03:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
Acres I do not know I I I don't I I have
 
03:17:26.309 --> 03:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
not made a study of the acreage of all
 
03:17:27.830 --> 03:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
the landfills in the state even though
 
03:17:31.830 --> 03:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
the number is relatively small uh but uh
 
03:17:35.150 --> 03:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
I think that uh
 
03:17:35.160 --> 03:17:37.030 align:start position:0%
I think that uh
the

03:17:37.030 --> 03:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:17:39.870 --> 03:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
uh that that's that's a question that is
 
03:17:42.389 --> 03:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
further down the road in terms of um
 
03:17:44.550 --> 03:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
whether you know that that would be
 
03:17:45.950 --> 03:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
something that would fall in into that
 
03:17:48.710 --> 03:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
further legislation issue as opposed to
 
03:17:50.710 --> 03:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh this bill which is essentially
 
03:17:52.830 --> 03:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
establishing a baseline policy I believe
 
03:17:55.429 --> 03:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
that number is accurate however so I
 
03:17:58.269 --> 03:17:58.279 align:start position:0%
have a question too
 
03:18:00.950 --> 03:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
about possible conflict of interest I
 
03:18:02.870 --> 03:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
mean I would imagine the state would
 
03:18:06.950 --> 03:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
still have to permit this land for use
 
03:18:07.950 --> 03:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
as a
 
03:18:12.469 --> 03:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
landfill so if it's a state-owned land
 
03:18:13.550 --> 03:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
and they're going through with the
 
03:18:16.510 --> 03:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
permitting process themselves isn't that
 
03:18:17.870 --> 03:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
a conflict of
 
03:18:21.309 --> 03:18:21.319 align:start position:0%
interest I I don't think so I think I I
 
03:18:23.550 --> 03:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
I I can't come up with spe specific
 
03:18:25.990 --> 03:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
examples right now but I I believe that
 
03:18:29.469 --> 03:18:29.479 align:start position:0%
there are a number of things that are
 
03:18:31.990 --> 03:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
regulated by state law that the state
 
03:18:36.590 --> 03:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
does and issues permits for so that uh
 
03:18:38.830 --> 03:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
in other words uh I don't think this is
 
03:18:41.710 --> 03:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
a new problem I think that there uh I I
 
03:18:44.950 --> 03:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
know that there are uh a number of
 
03:18:49.150 --> 03:18:49.160 align:start position:0%
existing conflict of interest um uh
 
03:18:51.229 --> 03:18:51.239 align:start position:0%
statutes or actually there there there
 
03:18:54.030 --> 03:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
are conflict of interest statutes in
 
03:18:57.910 --> 03:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
existing law and uh they may already be
 
03:19:00.950 --> 03:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
applicable uh to this particular
 
03:19:03.830 --> 03:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
situation uh
 
03:19:05.910 --> 03:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
any any
 
03:19:08.389 --> 03:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
Arrangement certain further legislation
 
03:19:13.389 --> 03:19:13.399 align:start position:0%
will certainly be needed to uh establish
 
03:19:17.070 --> 03:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
what the how the RFP process would work
 
03:19:19.389 --> 03:19:19.399 align:start position:0%
and how and that could also include
 
03:19:22.189 --> 03:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
further legislation in terms of uh how
 
03:19:24.510 --> 03:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
the permitting would
 
03:19:27.750 --> 03:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
work okay uh representative nav thank
 
03:19:29.309 --> 03:19:29.319 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you for taking my
 
03:19:32.070 --> 03:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
question um so it sounds like one of the
 
03:19:33.750 --> 03:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
main goals of this is to give us more
 
03:19:36.389 --> 03:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
control on whether we take or how much
 
03:19:38.550 --> 03:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
out of state waste we take do you see
 
03:19:40.429 --> 03:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
other benefits to the state owning the
 
03:19:42.750 --> 03:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
landfill or is that the primary
 
03:19:45.269 --> 03:19:45.279 align:start position:0%
driving force behind this legislation
 
03:19:49.229 --> 03:19:49.239 align:start position:0%
the primary driving force is uh that it
 
03:19:51.590 --> 03:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
gives us control over the out ofate
 
03:19:55.590 --> 03:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
waste uh a I think a secondary benefit
 
03:19:58.150 --> 03:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
is that when it comes to actually
 
03:20:00.550 --> 03:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
sighting another landfill when it's
 
03:20:03.349 --> 03:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
needed uh it could be sighted in a place
 
03:20:07.070 --> 03:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
that is more convenient to uh the larger
 
03:20:09.030 --> 03:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
portion of the population that needs to
 
03:20:11.429 --> 03:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
be shipping waste than our current
 
03:20:11.439 --> 03:20:14.229 align:start position:0%
be shipping waste than our current
landfill

03:20:14.229 --> 03:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:14.239 --> 03:20:16.550 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:20:16.550 --> 03:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:20:19.710 --> 03:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
Katon okay thank you madam chair I'm
 
03:20:20.910 --> 03:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand what you're
 
03:20:24.429 --> 03:20:24.439 align:start position:0%
saying so if the state is responsible
 
03:20:26.510 --> 03:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
for citing it then the state rules that
 
03:20:28.590 --> 03:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
we're developing don't
 
03:20:32.309 --> 03:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
apply uh no in fact the state rules the
 
03:20:35.510 --> 03:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
existing state rules would apply so so
 
03:20:38.030 --> 03:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
how is that different than I mean I
 
03:20:40.309 --> 03:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
don't understand why why the criteria
 
03:20:43.349 --> 03:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
would be you could get a place closer if
 
03:20:44.990 --> 03:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
a state is doing it versus a private
 
03:20:49.950 --> 03:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
entity oh well the so um currently there
 
03:20:53.670 --> 03:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
is a u permit in there's a permit that
 
03:20:56.349 --> 03:20:56.359 align:start position:0%
has been submitted to the state for uh
 
03:20:58.950 --> 03:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
developing a landfill and that landfill
 
03:21:02.150 --> 03:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
is uh in a location that is actually a
 
03:21:04.229 --> 03:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
fair distance away from a lot of our
 
03:21:08.910 --> 03:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
population centers and uh one of the
 
03:21:11.189 --> 03:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
thing one of the driving factors behind
 
03:21:12.429 --> 03:21:12.439 align:start position:0%
that so
 
03:21:15.790 --> 03:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
um that location choice is that someone
 
03:21:17.429 --> 03:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
happened to have that piece of land
 
03:21:18.710 --> 03:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
available for
 
03:21:23.790 --> 03:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
sale and uh which is not really the best
 
03:21:25.750 --> 03:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
way to to decide where you're going to
 
03:21:28.269 --> 03:21:28.279 align:start position:0%
put a landfill uh
 
03:21:28.279 --> 03:21:30.070 align:start position:0%
put a landfill uh
so

03:21:30.070 --> 03:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:35.429 --> 03:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
um certainly if there is a uh location
 
03:21:37.790 --> 03:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
that the state happens to own that has
 
03:21:39.309 --> 03:21:39.319 align:start position:0%
highly porous
 
03:21:41.870 --> 03:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
soils that's not a place that the
 
03:21:44.030 --> 03:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
Department should be saying well maybe
 
03:21:47.590 --> 03:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
we'll put a landfill here so the the all
 
03:21:50.269 --> 03:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
of the restrictions in terms of what
 
03:21:51.990 --> 03:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
kinds of soils are necessary what kinds
 
03:21:55.590 --> 03:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
of setbacks are necessary under current
 
03:21:58.550 --> 03:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
and the now developing rules would be
 
03:22:00.790 --> 03:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
applicable to any site that the state
 
03:22:03.590 --> 03:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
would choose as a as a land landfill
 
03:22:07.150 --> 03:22:07.160 align:start position:0%
site so uh just because the state owns
 
03:22:09.389 --> 03:22:09.399 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that they can be sloppy
 
03:22:13.870 --> 03:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
about uh you know what the environmental
 
03:22:18.309 --> 03:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh precautions should be okay thank you
 
03:22:20.510 --> 03:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions re uh representative
 
03:22:22.830 --> 03:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
comto thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:22:24.950 --> 03:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
03:22:29.670 --> 03:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
question I understand the purpose of the
 
03:22:33.790 --> 03:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
bill however I see a lot of lot more
 
03:22:37.150 --> 03:22:37.160 align:start position:0%
questions and one of the questions is is
 
03:22:39.790 --> 03:22:39.800 align:start position:0%
who is responsible for the liability
 
03:22:42.910 --> 03:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
insurance who is going to responsible if
 
03:22:45.790 --> 03:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
anything leaks is it going to be the
 
03:22:47.510 --> 03:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire is it going to
 
03:22:49.950 --> 03:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
be the management company I mean there
 
03:22:53.070 --> 03:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
are a lot of questions here and if the
 
03:22:55.150 --> 03:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
state already has a suitable place for a
 
03:22:57.229 --> 03:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
landsite why couldn't they offer that up
 
03:23:00.389 --> 03:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
for sale to an operator that's willing
 
03:23:03.469 --> 03:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
to put in a landfill I mean I understand
 
03:23:05.309 --> 03:23:05.319 align:start position:0%
the underlying intent but I'm just
 
03:23:09.710 --> 03:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
asking those questions okay so uh the to
 
03:23:13.469 --> 03:23:13.479 align:start position:0%
the last question uh if the if the site
 
03:23:15.349 --> 03:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
if the state had a suitable site at the
 
03:23:19.309 --> 03:23:19.319 align:start position:0%
moment there would be nothing
 
03:23:23.630 --> 03:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
that there it would not be um out of the
 
03:23:25.590 --> 03:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
question for the state to offer that for
 
03:23:28.870 --> 03:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
sale for a landfill to some company uh
 
03:23:32.030 --> 03:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
but that would require a a different Act
 
03:23:36.429 --> 03:23:36.439 align:start position:0%
of this legislature because it is uh a
 
03:23:39.309 --> 03:23:39.319 align:start position:0%
dis disposition of state property and
 
03:23:41.469 --> 03:23:41.479 align:start position:0%
similarly to the way that we need we
 
03:23:44.030 --> 03:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
need need to weigh in on things like uh
 
03:23:46.990 --> 03:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
the state school in lonia
 
03:23:50.670 --> 03:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
um but
 
03:23:54.790 --> 03:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh okay I forgot the first half of that
 
03:23:57.750 --> 03:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
question it's okay liability oh
 
03:24:01.870 --> 03:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
liability that is something that so the
 
03:24:06.389 --> 03:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
this build does not um purport to be the
 
03:24:08.910 --> 03:24:08.920 align:start position:0%
uh everything that is needed in order to
 
03:24:11.630 --> 03:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
to to make this operational this is a
 
03:24:14.790 --> 03:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
essentially establishing a a baseline
 
03:24:17.189 --> 03:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
policy and I know that further
 
03:24:19.630 --> 03:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
legislation will be needed in order to
 
03:24:23.710 --> 03:24:23.720 align:start position:0%
make this operational and a lot of the
 
03:24:26.269 --> 03:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
questions in terms of liability in terms
 
03:24:28.670 --> 03:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
of uh what would be the responsibility
 
03:24:30.590 --> 03:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
of an operator versus the responsibility
 
03:24:32.830 --> 03:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
of the state would have to be worked out
 
03:24:35.349 --> 03:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
in some combination of further
 
03:24:37.469 --> 03:24:37.479 align:start position:0%
legislation and rules that were directed
 
03:24:39.150 --> 03:24:39.160 align:start position:0%
by that
 
03:24:41.590 --> 03:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
legislation representative H Haskins
 
03:24:42.990 --> 03:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:24:44.790 --> 03:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
representative could you talk a little
 
03:24:46.790 --> 03:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
bit about the interstate commerce clause
 
03:24:50.309 --> 03:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
and how that kicks in okay so I am not
 
03:24:51.910 --> 03:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
going to say that I'm a constitutional
 
03:24:54.030 --> 03:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
lawyer I'm not even a
 
03:24:57.630 --> 03:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
lawyer but my understanding of the con
 
03:24:59.990 --> 03:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
of the interstate commerce clause and I
 
03:25:01.630 --> 03:25:01.640 align:start position:0%
I I believe that representative gerana
 
03:25:03.110 --> 03:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
may be able to speak to this a little
 
03:25:05.750 --> 03:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
bit more specifically because I think
 
03:25:07.870 --> 03:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
that there was that that was included in
 
03:25:11.550 --> 03:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
the report that his uh subcommittee uh
 
03:25:15.510 --> 03:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
worked on so uh but a rough version of
 
03:25:20.830 --> 03:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
that is that uh no that states
 
03:25:25.550 --> 03:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
cannot uh put limits on in on interstate
 
03:25:30.229 --> 03:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
commerce that will uh in some way
 
03:25:33.349 --> 03:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
Advantage uh the state over other states
 
03:25:38.269 --> 03:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
because it's crossing state lines and uh
 
03:25:42.229 --> 03:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
the way that that comes into play with
 
03:25:48.269 --> 03:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
the with trash is that the capacity to
 
03:25:50.990 --> 03:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh dispose of trash is considered
 
03:25:53.510 --> 03:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
Commerce and
 
03:25:57.870 --> 03:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
therefore uh putting a restriction on of
 
03:26:00.750 --> 03:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
on waste from out of state that is not
 
03:26:03.830 --> 03:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
also on waste from in the state is not
 
03:26:07.710 --> 03:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
something that the state can impose on a
 
03:26:07.720 --> 03:26:09.670 align:start position:0%
something that the state can impose on a
private

03:26:09.670 --> 03:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
private
 
03:26:12.349 --> 03:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
business uh however
 
03:26:15.790 --> 03:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
the state does have the capacity to say
 
03:26:18.910 --> 03:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
what the state as a governmental body is
 
03:26:21.870 --> 03:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
willing to accept or not so that and
 
03:26:24.429 --> 03:26:24.439 align:start position:0%
that's that's basically why I did the
 
03:26:28.510 --> 03:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
bill this way yes uh so uh
 
03:26:31.830 --> 03:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
so uh there there may be and we have
 
03:26:33.510 --> 03:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
another bill coming up that suggests
 
03:26:35.229 --> 03:26:35.239 align:start position:0%
well maybe we can just put a limit on it
 
03:26:37.110 --> 03:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that that's going to work
 
03:26:39.469 --> 03:26:39.479 align:start position:0%
uh I think that uh in terms of the
 
03:26:42.469 --> 03:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
Commerce Clause this bill is probably
 
03:26:46.710 --> 03:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
Sounder uh and uh which is one of the
 
03:26:49.630 --> 03:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
reasons I I put it forward thank
 
03:26:52.309 --> 03:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
03:26:55.189 --> 03:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you and I'll
 
03:26:57.429 --> 03:26:57.439 align:start position:0%
call Representative Nick
 
03:27:05.229 --> 03:27:05.239 align:start position:0%

03:27:16.630 --> 03:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
was on the study committee to look at
 
03:27:16.640 --> 03:27:17.309 align:start position:0%
was on the study committee to look at
the

03:27:17.309 --> 03:27:17.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:27:20.070 --> 03:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
unlimited uh service area permits
 
03:27:22.950 --> 03:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
landfills for to deal with out estate uh
 
03:27:25.030 --> 03:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
the question of out ofate uh waste
 
03:27:27.389 --> 03:27:27.399 align:start position:0%
coming into New Hampshire we met as you
 
03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
can see uh yesterday representative Ro
 
03:27:31.950 --> 03:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
Fort handed out the first several pages
 
03:27:34.150 --> 03:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
of our report I also emailed that report
 
03:27:35.830 --> 03:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
around I think it was on
 
03:27:38.510 --> 03:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
Sunday the uh meeting times you can see
 
03:27:40.469 --> 03:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
we met between the middle of August uh
 
03:27:42.389 --> 03:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
and the end of August October we
 
03:27:44.870 --> 03:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
completed our report we had unanimous
 
03:27:48.229 --> 03:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
agreement it was a bipartisan bamal
 
03:27:50.670 --> 03:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
committee uh it was myself two
 
03:27:52.389 --> 03:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
Republican colleagues from the house and
 
03:27:54.189 --> 03:27:54.199 align:start position:0%
a republican colleague in the Senate who
 
03:27:56.790 --> 03:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
was the chair of committee the committee
 
03:27:59.870 --> 03:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
we uh came to a unanimous agreement on
 
03:28:02.870 --> 03:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
the final report and the one specific
 
03:28:04.790 --> 03:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that this
 
03:28:08.389 --> 03:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
bipartison bamal study group endorsed
 
03:28:10.630 --> 03:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
was this piece of legislation it offered
 
03:28:12.750 --> 03:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
a number of other recommendations but
 
03:28:15.229 --> 03:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
this was the one piece of legislation uh
 
03:28:18.389 --> 03:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
that we agreed on uh endorsing I'm
 
03:28:21.590 --> 03:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
confident that uh there may be some
 
03:28:24.269 --> 03:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
amendments which we wish to discuss and
 
03:28:27.870 --> 03:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
are open to uh including in the bill I'm
 
03:28:31.670 --> 03:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
I am reasonably optimistic that that
 
03:28:33.189 --> 03:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that can make it through
 
03:28:35.309 --> 03:28:35.319 align:start position:0%
both the house and the Senate into the
 
03:28:38.269 --> 03:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
governor's desk um I will say I
 
03:28:39.670 --> 03:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
certainly don't want to make any claims
 
03:28:42.070 --> 03:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
to knowing things uh that I don't know
 
03:28:44.309 --> 03:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
or being privy to private conversations
 
03:28:46.269 --> 03:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
but senator avard who chaired our
 
03:28:48.510 --> 03:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
committee uh said that he would not
 
03:28:50.950 --> 03:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
endorse any recommendations that he was
 
03:28:53.469 --> 03:28:53.479 align:start position:0%
not confident could uh go to the
 
03:28:56.710 --> 03:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
governor and be signed uh and he fully
 
03:28:59.710 --> 03:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
endorsed this recommendation uh of the
 
03:29:02.550 --> 03:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
committee he signed off on the report as
 
03:29:04.870 --> 03:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
and he uh told the committee and at that
 
03:29:08.710 --> 03:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
final meeting uh he endorsed the uh and
 
03:29:10.790 --> 03:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
that was as you said after uh we had had
 
03:29:13.429 --> 03:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
these disc discussion so uh I am
 
03:29:15.630 --> 03:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
reasonably confident that we can get
 
03:29:17.510 --> 03:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
this through both houses and to the
 
03:29:20.790 --> 03:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
governor's desk the reason why this
 
03:29:22.510 --> 03:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
particular bill was chosen for the
 
03:29:24.950 --> 03:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee to endorse is really you're
 
03:29:28.150 --> 03:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
facing three possible solutions to the
 
03:29:30.670 --> 03:29:30.680 align:start position:0%
to dealing with the issue of outof State
 
03:29:34.550 --> 03:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
waste number one we could limit some
 
03:29:37.070 --> 03:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
things certain materials for example
 
03:29:40.429 --> 03:29:40.439 align:start position:0%
mattresses both for New Hampshire
 
03:29:43.670 --> 03:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
residents and for out ofate residents
 
03:29:44.910 --> 03:29:44.920 align:start position:0%
right so there's certain things that we
 
03:29:46.349 --> 03:29:46.359 align:start position:0%
don't want to landfill because of
 
03:29:49.870 --> 03:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
concern for uh pasas and other toxins we
 
03:29:51.750 --> 03:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
could limit them both in state and out
 
03:29:53.429 --> 03:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
of state that raises questions about
 
03:29:54.710 --> 03:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
what we would do with our instate
 
03:29:57.550 --> 03:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
sources of those waste uh that waste
 
03:29:59.469 --> 03:29:59.479 align:start position:0%
because the interstate commerce clause
 
03:30:01.150 --> 03:30:01.160 align:start position:0%
says that uh they would have to be
 
03:30:03.269 --> 03:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
treated equally so that's one
 
03:30:05.469 --> 03:30:05.479 align:start position:0%
solution another solution which we'll be
 
03:30:07.110 --> 03:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
discussing this afternoon is the
 
03:30:07.120 --> 03:30:08.830 align:start position:0%
discussing this afternoon is the
possibility

03:30:08.830 --> 03:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
03:30:11.670 --> 03:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
of going through the State Commerce
 
03:30:14.229 --> 03:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
Clause in the sense of in a way
 
03:30:17.030 --> 03:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
challenging it saying that the
 
03:30:20.349 --> 03:30:20.359 align:start position:0%
legislature uh mandates a 15%
 
03:30:22.790 --> 03:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
cap that would have to be litigated
 
03:30:24.790 --> 03:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
almost certainly we certainly could
 
03:30:26.349 --> 03:30:26.359 align:start position:0%
Prevail on that I think there's a very
 
03:30:28.429 --> 03:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
strong argument to be made that we're
 
03:30:30.110 --> 03:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
talking about resources that belong to
 
03:30:31.710 --> 03:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
the people of the State of New Hampshire
 
03:30:35.349 --> 03:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
that landfills affect uh air quality
 
03:30:35.359 --> 03:30:36.469 align:start position:0%
that landfills affect uh air quality
water

03:30:36.469 --> 03:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
water
 
03:30:40.429 --> 03:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
quality uh uh and so for those reasons
 
03:30:42.590 --> 03:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
it is within our rights to be able to
 
03:30:45.110 --> 03:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
put a cap on out ofate trash uh but it
 
03:30:47.269 --> 03:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
is I think a riskier move because we
 
03:30:49.590 --> 03:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
don't know how that would uh how that
 
03:30:52.189 --> 03:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
would play out in courts the third
 
03:30:55.590 --> 03:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
possibility is to have publicly owned
 
03:30:57.429 --> 03:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
landfills and that could either be
 
03:31:01.830 --> 03:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:04.429 --> 03:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
subdivision as we do currently have some
 
03:31:06.710 --> 03:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
like in Lebanon for example uh one that
 
03:31:08.710 --> 03:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
is owned by a municipality a group of
 
03:31:11.429 --> 03:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities could go in together uh
 
03:31:13.750 --> 03:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
on this uh one of the things that we put
 
03:31:15.790 --> 03:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
in the bill as an agreement among all of
 
03:31:17.790 --> 03:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
us on the study committee was that if it
 
03:31:20.349 --> 03:31:20.359 align:start position:0%
was publicly owned by the state it would
 
03:31:22.189 --> 03:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
be privately operated the state is not
 
03:31:25.750 --> 03:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
getting in on this business uh it is not
 
03:31:27.990 --> 03:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
an attempt to take business away from
 
03:31:30.429 --> 03:31:30.439 align:start position:0%
operators in the field the purpose of
 
03:31:34.030 --> 03:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
having it publicly owned is that we can
 
03:31:35.550 --> 03:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
get around the restrictions on the
 
03:31:37.110 --> 03:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce clause this is done
 
03:31:38.950 --> 03:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
in Maine this is done in Rhode Island I
 
03:31:40.590 --> 03:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
know those are two states in in New
 
03:31:43.510 --> 03:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
England where they have some uh publicly
 
03:31:46.030 --> 03:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
owned landfills Vermont has one landfill
 
03:31:48.510 --> 03:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
it is privately owned but it is subject
 
03:31:51.990 --> 03:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
to a host of restrictions that we do not
 
03:31:53.710 --> 03:31:53.720 align:start position:0%
put on our landfills which is why we
 
03:31:55.790 --> 03:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
have become the place where people send
 
03:31:58.590 --> 03:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
their trash uh in New
 
03:32:01.429 --> 03:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
England if we have a publicly owned
 
03:32:05.150 --> 03:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
landfill not only can we put a cap on
 
03:32:06.750 --> 03:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
the amount of out ofate trash and I
 
03:32:08.269 --> 03:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
think we would want to have for reasons
 
03:32:10.590 --> 03:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to talk about there we would
 
03:32:10.600 --> 03:32:11.389 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to talk about there we would
want

03:32:11.389 --> 03:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
want
 
03:32:13.670 --> 03:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
that number to not be zero we would want
 
03:32:15.950 --> 03:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
that number to be I know 10 15% there
 
03:32:18.429 --> 03:32:18.439 align:start position:0%
were reasons why we actually do aside
 
03:32:20.670 --> 03:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
from Strictly economic reasons there are
 
03:32:22.750 --> 03:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
reasons in terms of how landfills
 
03:32:25.590 --> 03:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
operate um we would want to be able to
 
03:32:27.510 --> 03:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
take a certain amount of out ofate waste
 
03:32:29.510 --> 03:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
but it would give us that flexibility
 
03:32:31.070 --> 03:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
the other thing that it would do it was
 
03:32:33.910 --> 03:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
it would allow us to distinguish between
 
03:32:37.349 --> 03:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
say mattresses or rugs that are produced
 
03:32:39.950 --> 03:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
as waste within New Hampshire and those
 
03:32:42.070 --> 03:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
same materials that are problematic to
 
03:32:44.950 --> 03:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
landfill coming in from out of state
 
03:32:47.309 --> 03:32:47.319 align:start position:0%
right as in my first example I I said we
 
03:32:48.790 --> 03:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
would have to treat under the interstate
 
03:32:51.750 --> 03:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
commerce clause those materials on on
 
03:32:54.349 --> 03:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
even footing with public ownership we
 
03:32:56.110 --> 03:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
could say there are certain materials
 
03:32:57.790 --> 03:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
because we know New Hampshire residents
 
03:32:59.830 --> 03:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
have to dispose of them that we would
 
03:33:01.790 --> 03:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
accept in uh these publicly owned
 
03:33:03.150 --> 03:33:03.160 align:start position:0%
landfills but we could say we're not
 
03:33:04.630 --> 03:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
going to accept those from out ofate
 
03:33:07.550 --> 03:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
landfill out of state sources another
 
03:33:09.630 --> 03:33:09.640 align:start position:0%
benefit of having a publicly owned
 
03:33:11.349 --> 03:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
landfill is that you can charge
 
03:33:13.269 --> 03:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
different rates in state and out of
 
03:33:15.870 --> 03:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
state right now we cannot do that we
 
03:33:18.429 --> 03:33:18.439 align:start position:0%
have to charge the same rates because
 
03:33:21.750 --> 03:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
these are private companies um we cannot
 
03:33:25.389 --> 03:33:25.399 align:start position:0%
require uh outof State haulers to pay a
 
03:33:28.469 --> 03:33:28.479 align:start position:0%
different tipping fee than instate
 
03:33:32.429 --> 03:33:32.439 align:start position:0%
haulers having publicly owned land is a
 
03:33:34.349 --> 03:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
solution to that as well we could under
 
03:33:37.229 --> 03:33:37.239 align:start position:0%
those circumstances choose to charge a
 
03:33:39.110 --> 03:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
higher tipping fee for haulers from out
 
03:33:41.750 --> 03:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
of state which could actually benefit
 
03:33:44.150 --> 03:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire operations and and
 
03:33:46.070 --> 03:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps help to help to offset some of
 
03:33:50.030 --> 03:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
the costs uh for New Hampshire
 
03:33:52.550 --> 03:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
residents uh Peter uh representative
 
03:33:56.830 --> 03:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
Bixby pardon me referred to um he he
 
03:33:59.670 --> 03:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
spoke to concerns that have been
 
03:34:01.550 --> 03:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
expressed about how this would affect
 
03:34:04.550 --> 03:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
business is this an anti-business Bill
 
03:34:07.870 --> 03:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
uh it is not it is uh a bill in facted
 
03:34:11.349 --> 03:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
in in some important ways benefits these
 
03:34:13.269 --> 03:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
operations as representative Bixby
 
03:34:15.910 --> 03:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
pointed out uh the initial outlay of
 
03:34:18.870 --> 03:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
funds to purchase the property uh would
 
03:34:22.710 --> 03:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
be State uh a state decision uh and a
 
03:34:24.910 --> 03:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
state investment uh and also the
 
03:34:26.710 --> 03:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
question of liability is a good question
 
03:34:28.229 --> 03:34:28.239 align:start position:0%
and we had a representative from the
 
03:34:29.750 --> 03:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office we talked
 
03:34:32.670 --> 03:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
about this uh yes absolutely the state
 
03:34:34.429 --> 03:34:34.439 align:start position:0%
would be assuming some liability as the
 
03:34:36.070 --> 03:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
landholder and quite frankly that's how
 
03:34:38.070 --> 03:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
it should be because we should be only
 
03:34:41.189 --> 03:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
citing these landfills in place is that
 
03:34:43.750 --> 03:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
we have the absolute and utmost
 
03:34:46.670 --> 03:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
confidence that they're going to be safe
 
03:34:48.630 --> 03:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
and if it takes saying that the state
 
03:34:51.229 --> 03:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
has to assume liability for us to make
 
03:34:52.830 --> 03:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
sure we have the strictest possible
 
03:34:55.269 --> 03:34:55.279 align:start position:0%
standards and that's what we should do
 
03:34:57.150 --> 03:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
the other piece of that however is it
 
03:34:59.229 --> 03:34:59.239 align:start position:0%
does depend on the terms of the lease
 
03:35:03.070 --> 03:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
right so in the lease you could say if
 
03:35:05.910 --> 03:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
it is determined that a leak is the
 
03:35:07.990 --> 03:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the operator because
 
03:35:10.910 --> 03:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
of operator malfunction liability sh in
 
03:35:12.550 --> 03:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
certain ways so certainly that that
 
03:35:14.469 --> 03:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
would be embedded in the lease as
 
03:35:17.189 --> 03:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
liability issues often are but as said I
 
03:35:18.710 --> 03:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
don't see having the state assume
 
03:35:20.990 --> 03:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
liability is a negative thing uh on the
 
03:35:23.309 --> 03:35:23.319 align:start position:0%
contrary I think uh it it means
 
03:35:25.630 --> 03:35:25.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully that we will be as serious as
 
03:35:28.070 --> 03:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
we really should be about where we put
 
03:35:31.229 --> 03:35:31.239 align:start position:0%
uh these sites so uh I'm happy to answer
 
03:35:33.349 --> 03:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
other questions about the committee
 
03:35:35.990 --> 03:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
about our conclusions about the Bill
 
03:35:38.590 --> 03:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair okay thank you I
 
03:35:42.150 --> 03:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate your um your explanations too
 
03:35:45.070 --> 03:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
and um my question is is there anything
 
03:35:47.750 --> 03:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
in law now that disallows the state from
 
03:35:50.269 --> 03:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
owning a landfill
 
03:35:53.710 --> 03:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
facility not that I'm aware of do you
 
03:35:56.070 --> 03:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
know of any reason why they
 
03:35:56.080 --> 03:35:57.710 align:start position:0%
know of any reason why they
don't

03:35:57.710 --> 03:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
don't
 
03:36:00.269 --> 03:36:00.279 align:start position:0%
currently why would we I mean that's my
 
03:36:02.309 --> 03:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
response to your question is under the
 
03:36:04.870 --> 03:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
current kind of regime as it were the
 
03:36:06.590 --> 03:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
way we do landfilling in the state I
 
03:36:09.030 --> 03:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
don't see any incentive for the state to
 
03:36:11.510 --> 03:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
do it absent the legislator instructing
 
03:36:12.950 --> 03:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh that to be the
 
03:36:16.790 --> 03:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
case Okay representative K thank you
 
03:36:21.830 --> 03:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair did the committee uh find uh
 
03:36:24.309 --> 03:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
with state owned land any sites that are
 
03:36:26.910 --> 03:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely suitable for this it was not
 
03:36:29.910 --> 03:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
the charge of the committee to do
 
03:36:32.950 --> 03:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
03:36:35.710 --> 03:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
kraton thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:36:35.720 --> 03:36:37.110 align:start position:0%
kraton thank you madam chair and thank
you

03:36:37.110 --> 03:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:36:39.309 --> 03:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
representative so
 
03:36:43.189 --> 03:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
I I I don't understand the the the
 
03:36:46.550 --> 03:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
dollars and cents so today according to
 
03:36:48.630 --> 03:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
testimony yesterday
 
03:36:51.830 --> 03:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
47% of the trash comes from out of
 
03:36:54.710 --> 03:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
state and so if you reduce that down to
 
03:36:57.630 --> 03:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
10 then you're taking that
 
03:37:03.189 --> 03:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
37% of uh income from that company away
 
03:37:03.199 --> 03:37:04.269 align:start position:0%
37% of uh income from that company away
it's

03:37:04.269 --> 03:37:04.279 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:37:09.070 --> 03:37:09.080 align:start position:0%
gone I don't understand how that can be
 
03:37:11.750 --> 03:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
financially the same I mean if you take
 
03:37:14.510 --> 03:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
37% of the business that's 37% of the
 
03:37:17.070 --> 03:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
business where is that how is that made
 
03:37:19.630 --> 03:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
up thank you for the question uh two
 
03:37:23.189 --> 03:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
things one is that uh you can charge
 
03:37:25.630 --> 03:37:25.640 align:start position:0%
more for out of state trash I'm not
 
03:37:27.469 --> 03:37:27.479 align:start position:0%
going to speculate as to how much of
 
03:37:29.750 --> 03:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
that margin that would make up for but
 
03:37:31.150 --> 03:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
that is part of the answer the other
 
03:37:33.030 --> 03:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
part of the answer as I referred to
 
03:37:34.950 --> 03:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
before is the the operator would be
 
03:37:36.790 --> 03:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
spared the outlay of funds in the first
 
03:37:40.710 --> 03:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
place which is an enormous savings uh on
 
03:37:43.150 --> 03:37:43.160 align:start position:0%
the on the part of the operator so I
 
03:37:46.309 --> 03:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
mean I can't give you a a breakdown for
 
03:37:47.870 --> 03:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
that because we're really working in in
 
03:37:49.429 --> 03:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
the realm of hypotheticals now because
 
03:37:50.870 --> 03:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about something that may
 
03:37:52.750 --> 03:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
be cited several years from now we would
 
03:37:54.389 --> 03:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
need land values we would need all kinds
 
03:37:55.990 --> 03:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
of information we don't have but th
 
03:37:57.389 --> 03:37:57.399 align:start position:0%
those are the two pieces that I would
 
03:37:58.830 --> 03:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
offer an answer to your question number
 
03:38:01.110 --> 03:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
one they can charge more for out estate
 
03:38:04.229 --> 03:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
waste that subsidizes the instate rates
 
03:38:06.670 --> 03:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
uh number one and number two there are
 
03:38:08.550 --> 03:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
savings for the company by using this
 
03:38:13.510 --> 03:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
model follow up So the plan then is for
 
03:38:18.110 --> 03:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
the state the taxpayers of the state to
 
03:38:20.870 --> 03:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
assume the liability and the cost of
 
03:38:23.150 --> 03:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
building this that the private company
 
03:38:27.269 --> 03:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
here to for has assumed so the taxpayers
 
03:38:29.189 --> 03:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
are now paying for the for buying the
 
03:38:31.150 --> 03:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
land for site preparation for all the
 
03:38:33.910 --> 03:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
permits and surveys and and all that
 
03:38:36.030 --> 03:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
that's all taxpayer dollars now well
 
03:38:38.550 --> 03:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
it's probably not all taxpayer dollars
 
03:38:40.870 --> 03:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
but first of all in that cas case that
 
03:38:42.550 --> 03:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
is I would argue the price that we are
 
03:38:44.150 --> 03:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
paying to make sure that we don't become
 
03:38:46.710 --> 03:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
The Dumping Ground of of trash uh from
 
03:38:48.269 --> 03:38:48.279 align:start position:0%
out of state from here until kingdom
 
03:38:50.389 --> 03:38:50.399 align:start position:0%
comes so there's a state investment but
 
03:38:52.229 --> 03:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
I would argue that state investment is
 
03:38:54.429 --> 03:38:54.439 align:start position:0%
worth it if we can as I said avoid that
 
03:38:57.349 --> 03:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
fate number one number two
 
03:38:59.710 --> 03:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
um now I'm blanking at what number two
 
03:39:01.910 --> 03:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
was but that was the first part of my my
 
03:39:04.590 --> 03:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
question oh the other is that the the
 
03:39:08.070 --> 03:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
costs would be potentially shared with
 
03:39:09.510 --> 03:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
the operator again that would depend
 
03:39:11.110 --> 03:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
upon how rulle are written and how
 
03:39:13.469 --> 03:39:13.479 align:start position:0%
contracts are are drawn up I mean
 
03:39:15.870 --> 03:39:15.880 align:start position:0%
presumably uh The Operators actually
 
03:39:18.030 --> 03:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
would be would have the expertise would
 
03:39:19.910 --> 03:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
be in a better position for example to
 
03:39:21.590 --> 03:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
be able to engage in some of that site
 
03:39:24.510 --> 03:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
preparation so uh
 
03:39:26.830 --> 03:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
again we're talking about hypothetical
 
03:39:28.750 --> 03:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
we're not looking at a a specific
 
03:39:30.510 --> 03:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
concrete situation in front of us at the
 
03:39:33.469 --> 03:39:33.479 align:start position:0%
moment but it's not necessarily the case
 
03:39:36.269 --> 03:39:36.279 align:start position:0%
that the state would assume the entirety
 
03:39:38.950 --> 03:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
of the cost for preparing a site okay
 
03:39:42.189 --> 03:39:42.199 align:start position:0%
thank you r representative kulan thank
 
03:39:44.229 --> 03:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
Madam chair and thank you R ger for
 
03:39:47.550 --> 03:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question so if the taxpayers
 
03:39:49.630 --> 03:39:49.640 align:start position:0%
are going to be funding this are you
 
03:39:52.830 --> 03:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
open to any kind of amendment to say
 
03:39:55.309 --> 03:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
that uh it should be the price should be
 
03:39:59.110 --> 03:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
locked into the lowest market rate at a
 
03:40:02.830 --> 03:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
landfill for local
 
03:40:05.349 --> 03:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
people yes thank you very much for the
 
03:40:06.670 --> 03:40:06.680 align:start position:0%
question that's something I had not
 
03:40:08.469 --> 03:40:08.479 align:start position:0%
thought about but yes I I think that we
 
03:40:11.469 --> 03:40:11.479 align:start position:0%
should absolutely all always you know
 
03:40:13.469 --> 03:40:13.479 align:start position:0%
try to find the lowest rate as we do
 
03:40:15.990 --> 03:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
when we put out rfps uh in terms of
 
03:40:19.349 --> 03:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
State contracts so um I hadn't thought
 
03:40:20.950 --> 03:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
about that as an amendment I'm I'm
 
03:40:22.469 --> 03:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
certainly open to it and I agree
 
03:40:24.429 --> 03:40:24.439 align:start position:0%
entirely with the
 
03:40:27.510 --> 03:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
concept representative Murray thank you
 
03:40:28.950 --> 03:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:40:30.590 --> 03:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
question I guess with regard to lowest
 
03:40:33.150 --> 03:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
market rate uh regardless of whether
 
03:40:34.630 --> 03:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
it's a state contract or Municipal
 
03:40:36.910 --> 03:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
contract County contract isn't that
 
03:40:39.710 --> 03:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
normally the norm in which rfps go out
 
03:40:41.910 --> 03:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
to bid and they look at the contracts
 
03:40:44.309 --> 03:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
that come back to from those bids to
 
03:40:46.070 --> 03:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
determine which are the
 
03:40:48.510 --> 03:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
lowest thank you uh representative that
 
03:40:50.150 --> 03:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding this is not an
 
03:40:51.469 --> 03:40:51.479 align:start position:0%
area I know a great deal about but
 
03:40:52.950 --> 03:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding about how State
 
03:40:54.790 --> 03:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
purchases are
 
03:41:00.269 --> 03:41:00.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:03.070 --> 03:41:03.080 align:start position:0%
Penza just try to put this in a question
 
03:41:04.550 --> 03:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
I just want
 
03:41:06.870 --> 03:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
um I just want to understand that that
 
03:41:10.510 --> 03:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
to clarify on the bill that this is is
 
03:41:15.030 --> 03:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
really just for the the the plot of land
 
03:41:16.710 --> 03:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
the suitability of the soil that would
 
03:41:18.910 --> 03:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
be the only piece that's happening on
 
03:41:21.349 --> 03:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
the state side of things every
 
03:41:25.269 --> 03:41:25.279 align:start position:0%
other operation design everything is all
 
03:41:28.269 --> 03:41:28.279 align:start position:0%
coming in the private realm correct with
 
03:41:28.279 --> 03:41:30.149 align:start position:0%
coming in the private realm correct with
this

03:41:30.149 --> 03:41:30.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:41:32.550 --> 03:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
bill the actual then thank you for the
 
03:41:36.309 --> 03:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
question uh the actual drawing up of the
 
03:41:38.349 --> 03:41:38.359 align:start position:0%
contract is not something that that I
 
03:41:40.630 --> 03:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
can speak to but but we're talking about
 
03:41:42.389 --> 03:41:42.399 align:start position:0%
the state purchasing the land
 
03:41:44.710 --> 03:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
determining that the land is suitable
 
03:41:47.229 --> 03:41:47.239 align:start position:0%
for a landfill and then entering into a
 
03:41:50.830 --> 03:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
contract with a private operator and my
 
03:41:52.790 --> 03:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
assumption is that based on the
 
03:41:55.229 --> 03:41:55.239 align:start position:0%
experience of that operator the state
 
03:41:56.990 --> 03:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
and the operator would then work
 
03:42:01.269 --> 03:42:01.279 align:start position:0%
together to prepare the site for when
 
03:42:03.710 --> 03:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
it's eventually uh opened represent
 
03:42:05.750 --> 03:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
pretends a
 
03:42:09.429 --> 03:42:09.439 align:start position:0%
followup so like how it currently stands
 
03:42:11.630 --> 03:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
the with the private operator that would
 
03:42:15.149 --> 03:42:15.159 align:start position:0%
be um running the entire operations of
 
03:42:18.030 --> 03:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
this underneath this realm here they
 
03:42:20.429 --> 03:42:20.439 align:start position:0%
would have all of that you know in a
 
03:42:23.750 --> 03:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
sense liability all of everything would
 
03:42:26.469 --> 03:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
all apply like it currently
 
03:42:29.030 --> 03:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
does thank you again for the question
 
03:42:30.950 --> 03:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
that would be determined in the lease
 
03:42:33.070 --> 03:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
agreement between the state and the
 
03:42:35.149 --> 03:42:35.159 align:start position:0%
operator as as I understand it based on
 
03:42:36.269 --> 03:42:36.279 align:start position:0%
our discussion with the Attorney
 
03:42:40.149 --> 03:42:40.159 align:start position:0%
General's office representative k thank
 
03:42:41.950 --> 03:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you again uh
 
03:42:44.149 --> 03:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
rep Jama for taking my
 
03:42:47.710 --> 03:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
question you had uh suggested earlier
 
03:42:51.710 --> 03:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
that um the benefit to uh the operator
 
03:42:54.070 --> 03:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
or the management team of the landfill
 
03:42:56.670 --> 03:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
is that they would have uh really no
 
03:42:58.950 --> 03:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
outlay because the state would be
 
03:43:03.590 --> 03:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
investing in all the capital um but yet
 
03:43:06.269 --> 03:43:06.279 align:start position:0%
what I just heard and maybe I heard
 
03:43:08.510 --> 03:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
incorrectly is that the state would only
 
03:43:12.229 --> 03:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
be purchasing purch ing the land and the
 
03:43:14.429 --> 03:43:14.439 align:start position:0%
contractor or management company would
 
03:43:19.229 --> 03:43:19.239 align:start position:0%
then be responsible for all of the um
 
03:43:22.189 --> 03:43:22.199 align:start position:0%
Capital um that has to go into the
 
03:43:25.149 --> 03:43:25.159 align:start position:0%
landfill including the liners Etc so I'm
 
03:43:26.590 --> 03:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
a little bit confused so if you could
 
03:43:29.630 --> 03:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
clarify from me I'd really appreciate it
 
03:43:31.990 --> 03:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you no that's a an excellent
 
03:43:35.269 --> 03:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
point uh uh so if we requesting
 
03:43:36.790 --> 03:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
permission to revise and extend my
 
03:43:40.110 --> 03:43:40.120 align:start position:0%
remarks uh I would go back and say that
 
03:43:42.469 --> 03:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
uh there is the initial outlay for the
 
03:43:44.110 --> 03:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
purchase of the land would be on the
 
03:43:47.469 --> 03:43:47.479 align:start position:0%
state other costs would I imagine be
 
03:43:49.349 --> 03:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
determined by the nature of the lease
 
03:43:50.990 --> 03:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
agreement between the state and the
 
03:43:54.349 --> 03:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
operator so I I can't speak to that that
 
03:43:55.950 --> 03:43:55.960 align:start position:0%
outlay and I think representative comp
 
03:43:57.870 --> 03:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
why you were you were correct that uh
 
03:43:59.229 --> 03:43:59.239 align:start position:0%
there probably would be other costs
 
03:44:02.070 --> 03:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
involved so yes you're right followup
 
03:44:06.469 --> 03:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair so to me um
 
03:44:10.309 --> 03:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
and land is is expensive
 
03:44:16.070 --> 03:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
but the preparation of the site to is um
 
03:44:18.550 --> 03:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
I would say is probably more
 
03:44:22.309 --> 03:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
expensive than the purchase of the land
 
03:44:23.750 --> 03:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh with everything that you have to do
 
03:44:27.630 --> 03:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
to prep aite to become a landfill so I
 
03:44:29.870 --> 03:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
don't see the cost savings to the
 
03:44:32.590 --> 03:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
businesses really I'm trying to uh
 
03:44:32.600 --> 03:44:34.229 align:start position:0%
businesses really I'm trying to uh
understand

03:44:34.229 --> 03:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
understand
 
03:44:36.070 --> 03:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
that okay I don't think there was a
 
03:44:38.590 --> 03:44:38.600 align:start position:0%
question there but
 
03:44:42.269 --> 03:44:42.279 align:start position:0%
okay well my question then to follow up
 
03:44:47.070 --> 03:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
on that is what would be the benefit to
 
03:44:47.080 --> 03:44:48.110 align:start position:0%
on that is what would be the benefit to
the

03:44:48.110 --> 03:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:44:51.030 --> 03:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
lesie the waste management company
 
03:44:51.040 --> 03:44:52.910 align:start position:0%
lesie the waste management company
whatever

03:44:52.910 --> 03:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
03:44:58.469 --> 03:44:58.479 align:start position:0%
to uh install liners and um put in all
 
03:45:03.870 --> 03:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
the work and money Capital to prepare
 
03:45:07.269 --> 03:45:07.279 align:start position:0%
the site and run its operations put up
 
03:45:07.279 --> 03:45:08.429 align:start position:0%
the site and run its operations put up
structures

03:45:08.429 --> 03:45:08.439 align:start position:0%
structures
 
03:45:11.790 --> 03:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
buildings what the benefit of that if
 
03:45:15.950 --> 03:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
eventually at some point they may leave
 
03:45:18.429 --> 03:45:18.439 align:start position:0%
that site if another you know say
 
03:45:20.070 --> 03:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
they're not doing a good job for
 
03:45:22.790 --> 03:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
whatever reason and the state decides to
 
03:45:25.269 --> 03:45:25.279 align:start position:0%
then enter into a new contract with
 
03:45:28.750 --> 03:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
another um Waste Management Company it
 
03:45:30.149 --> 03:45:30.159 align:start position:0%
seems like you know they're they're
 
03:45:33.030 --> 03:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
putting in all the capital and work and
 
03:45:37.349 --> 03:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
they may not be able to um you know they
 
03:45:40.469 --> 03:45:40.479 align:start position:0%
have no real ownership of it
 
03:45:41.550 --> 03:45:41.560 align:start position:0%
I think that's a good question I think
 
03:45:44.870 --> 03:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
the incentive uh is for them to to do a
 
03:45:46.349 --> 03:45:46.359 align:start position:0%
good job and keep the contract with the
 
03:45:48.070 --> 03:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
state so that they could continue to
 
03:45:49.469 --> 03:45:49.479 align:start position:0%
operate the
 
03:45:52.670 --> 03:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
facility okay representative
 
03:45:54.910 --> 03:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
Dy thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:45:57.189 --> 03:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question okay so I've said
 
03:45:59.269 --> 03:45:59.279 align:start position:0%
this before nashwa has you know a
 
03:46:03.389 --> 03:46:03.399 align:start position:0%
municipal landfill um and I I I have to
 
03:46:05.790 --> 03:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
tell you nobody thinks much about it uh
 
03:46:08.070 --> 03:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
because it runs pretty well the other
 
03:46:10.590 --> 03:46:10.600 align:start position:0%
thing is is that in from a municipal
 
03:46:13.670 --> 03:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
perspective we have a u a commission a
 
03:46:16.670 --> 03:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
department of a public works commission
 
03:46:19.790 --> 03:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh they're all elected um so you know so
 
03:46:22.550 --> 03:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
we have accountability uh if things go
 
03:46:25.229 --> 03:46:25.239 align:start position:0%
wrong with the landfill you know then we
 
03:46:28.070 --> 03:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
can uh vote out of office those are you
 
03:46:30.269 --> 03:46:30.279 align:start position:0%
know that are in place so my question to
 
03:46:34.429 --> 03:46:34.439 align:start position:0%
you um is was any that local control you
 
03:46:36.670 --> 03:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
know because we've talked we've had a
 
03:46:40.309 --> 03:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion here about um
 
03:46:42.670 --> 03:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
citiz residents not feeling like they're
 
03:46:45.149 --> 03:46:45.159 align:start position:0%
being heard you know in the sighting of
 
03:46:47.309 --> 03:46:47.319 align:start position:0%
landfill not feeling like they have any
 
03:46:49.910 --> 03:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
control over it uh did the committee
 
03:46:52.830 --> 03:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
talk about um the fact that a
 
03:46:55.229 --> 03:46:55.239 align:start position:0%
state-owned or a municipal owned
 
03:46:57.670 --> 03:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
landfill uh would give the residents
 
03:46:59.870 --> 03:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
more local control because they can vote
 
03:47:02.349 --> 03:47:02.359 align:start position:0%
people in and out of office thank you
 
03:47:03.630 --> 03:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
for the question that that is not
 
03:47:05.510 --> 03:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
something we discussed this bill really
 
03:47:07.469 --> 03:47:07.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't affect municipalities right
 
03:47:09.349 --> 03:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
because they currently have the ability
 
03:47:11.149 --> 03:47:11.159 align:start position:0%
at in as in the case of Nashwood to be
 
03:47:13.389 --> 03:47:13.399 align:start position:0%
able to operate their own facility so I
 
03:47:14.830 --> 03:47:14.840 align:start position:0%
think that's an excellent point but it's
 
03:47:16.349 --> 03:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
not something we discussed in the study
 
03:47:18.710 --> 03:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
committee representative Murray and then
 
03:47:21.229 --> 03:47:21.239 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam chair um thank you
 
03:47:23.469 --> 03:47:23.479 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I did just
 
03:47:26.790 --> 03:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
want to sort of focus on this this facet
 
03:47:29.149 --> 03:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
for a minute um the bill does state that
 
03:47:30.429 --> 03:47:30.439 align:start position:0%
um there are other political
 
03:47:33.670 --> 03:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
subdivisions that potentially could um
 
03:47:35.189 --> 03:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
become involved in the running of a
 
03:47:36.389 --> 03:47:36.399 align:start position:0%
landfill whether it's a regional
 
03:47:38.110 --> 03:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
Landfill District or a state-owned
 
03:47:40.309 --> 03:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
landfill district and to that end I
 
03:47:42.750 --> 03:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
guess I had um a question about whether
 
03:47:45.469 --> 03:47:45.479 align:start position:0%
or not you envisioned uh to the members
 
03:47:48.070 --> 03:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
point about elected public works or
 
03:47:48.080 --> 03:47:50.110 align:start position:0%
point about elected public works or
elected

03:47:50.110 --> 03:47:50.120 align:start position:0%
elected
 
03:47:54.550 --> 03:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
entities um do we know how
 
03:47:56.870 --> 03:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
many municipalities or public
 
03:47:59.469 --> 03:47:59.479 align:start position:0%
subdivisions elect their Public Works
 
03:48:02.389 --> 03:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
folks and follow up if I may to that
 
03:48:04.870 --> 03:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
sure um the second part of that question
 
03:48:07.590 --> 03:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
then is with regard to some of the
 
03:48:10.070 --> 03:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
oversight at the state level would would
 
03:48:11.830 --> 03:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
you envision that those would be
 
03:48:14.269 --> 03:48:14.279 align:start position:0%
potentially an elected position as
 
03:48:16.710 --> 03:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question it's not
 
03:48:18.349 --> 03:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
something that the committee discussed
 
03:48:20.469 --> 03:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
the reference to M political
 
03:48:22.510 --> 03:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
subdivisions here is is here to
 
03:48:24.870 --> 03:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
distinguish because uh I mean first of
 
03:48:26.030 --> 03:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
all as you said nothing should change
 
03:48:27.910 --> 03:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
for municipalities they can currently do
 
03:48:29.510 --> 03:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
this the reason why they're referenced
 
03:48:31.830 --> 03:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
in the bill at all is to distinguish
 
03:48:35.349 --> 03:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
between uh if the landfill is owned by
 
03:48:37.990 --> 03:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
the state it will be privately operated
 
03:48:40.349 --> 03:48:40.359 align:start position:0%
and we're not Ming mandate that at the
 
03:48:41.950 --> 03:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
the municipal level so the only reason
 
03:48:44.349 --> 03:48:44.359 align:start position:0%
why we reference municipalities in this
 
03:48:47.070 --> 03:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
case is to make it clear that they can
 
03:48:50.229 --> 03:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
operate them themselves right that that
 
03:48:52.389 --> 03:48:52.399 align:start position:0%
when we talk about uh publicly owned
 
03:48:54.309 --> 03:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
privately operated that that applies
 
03:48:56.830 --> 03:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
only to state-owned landfills and not to
 
03:48:58.469 --> 03:48:58.479 align:start position:0%
municipally Owned landfills so no we did
 
03:48:59.830 --> 03:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
not have a discussion about the
 
03:49:01.870 --> 03:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
oversight of Municipal
 
03:49:04.670 --> 03:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
landfills representative Penza and then
 
03:49:08.309 --> 03:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:08.319 --> 03:49:11.830 align:start position:0%
 
Haskins

03:49:11.830 --> 03:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:13.349 --> 03:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
I I don't have a lot of information but
 
03:49:16.229 --> 03:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
I have enough in regards with uh with
 
03:49:20.990 --> 03:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
Rochester so um the the cost for
 
03:49:24.710 --> 03:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
land alone that it's not it's millions
 
03:49:27.110 --> 03:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
of dollars that they've spent do you're
 
03:49:28.950 --> 03:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
realizing that we're talking about that
 
03:49:31.710 --> 03:49:31.720 align:start position:0%
just if if we're just talking about land
 
03:49:34.110 --> 03:49:34.120 align:start position:0%
and and not about the site work and all
 
03:49:35.750 --> 03:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
of that that would be a private entity
 
03:49:37.910 --> 03:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
right so it's millions of dollars that
 
03:49:40.710 --> 03:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
would be a savings for the private
 
03:49:43.429 --> 03:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
landfill operator correct that is my
 
03:49:45.510 --> 03:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
understanding okay so then what about
 
03:49:48.990 --> 03:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
all of the work that's done to make sure
 
03:49:51.710 --> 03:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
that it is a site that would also be on
 
03:49:54.870 --> 03:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
the state side as well so that's also
 
03:49:56.750 --> 03:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
that's drilling of the wells all of that
 
03:49:59.349 --> 03:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
kind of work that's done for the site
 
03:50:02.910 --> 03:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
suitable that would also be on the state
 
03:50:05.030 --> 03:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
correct I believe and thank you for the
 
03:50:07.309 --> 03:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
question I believe those specifics would
 
03:50:10.830 --> 03:50:10.840 align:start position:0%
be worked out between the state and the
 
03:50:13.349 --> 03:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
the operator who has the
 
03:50:17.389 --> 03:50:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:21.550 --> 03:50:21.560 align:start position:0%
follow only because it would be you you
 
03:50:24.389 --> 03:50:24.399 align:start position:0%
would have to have that for all those
 
03:50:26.149 --> 03:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
expenses the cost of the land and making
 
03:50:27.910 --> 03:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
sure it's suitable and all that would
 
03:50:30.269 --> 03:50:30.279 align:start position:0%
have to be on the state side of things
 
03:50:32.389 --> 03:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
because then you go to the private
 
03:50:34.429 --> 03:50:34.439 align:start position:0%
operator to say hey do you want to run
 
03:50:36.950 --> 03:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
this that's what I'm saying you that's
 
03:50:38.990 --> 03:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
that's the piece that I think we are
 
03:50:40.870 --> 03:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
getting getting it's getting muddy isn't
 
03:50:42.990 --> 03:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
that clear I think that's clear in here
 
03:50:44.550 --> 03:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
my apologies thank you I I didn't
 
03:50:45.630 --> 03:50:45.640 align:start position:0%
understand the question yes I mean the
 
03:50:46.870 --> 03:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
state would have to determine that it
 
03:50:49.349 --> 03:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
was a suitable site and there is work
 
03:50:52.070 --> 03:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
involved in doing that and that would be
 
03:50:54.670 --> 03:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
the state's responsibility before you
 
03:50:58.429 --> 03:50:58.439 align:start position:0%
can even offer that site to uh a l or in
 
03:51:00.670 --> 03:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
order to to run the operation so yes
 
03:51:03.229 --> 03:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
that would also be incurred by the state
 
03:51:05.309 --> 03:51:05.319 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins thank you madam
 
03:51:06.830 --> 03:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you
 
03:51:08.790 --> 03:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative are we not talking about
 
03:51:11.309 --> 03:51:11.319 align:start position:0%
a business business where the profit
 
03:51:13.750 --> 03:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
margin is not
 
03:51:17.750 --> 03:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
Slim So if operating if they don't have
 
03:51:20.670 --> 03:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
to pay the expense for the
 
03:51:24.070 --> 03:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
land they're ahead of the game and it
 
03:51:25.990 --> 03:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that we wouldn't have
 
03:51:29.070 --> 03:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
to worry that they'd want to operate a
 
03:51:31.670 --> 03:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
landfill because they've just saved a
 
03:51:34.269 --> 03:51:34.279 align:start position:0%
huge amount of money but yes the money's
 
03:51:37.309 --> 03:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
on them to build the landfill and to
 
03:51:39.510 --> 03:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
operate it according to the contract act
 
03:51:43.149 --> 03:51:43.159 align:start position:0%
with the state is that not correct yes
 
03:51:44.510 --> 03:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and as we've
 
03:51:46.110 --> 03:51:46.120 align:start position:0%
seen in the solid waste management
 
03:51:48.510 --> 03:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
report we're not reducing nor will we be
 
03:51:50.550 --> 03:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
over the next 20 years the amount of of
 
03:51:52.469 --> 03:51:52.479 align:start position:0%
waste that we're landfilling we're going
 
03:51:54.750 --> 03:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
to be more than 50% behind our Target
 
03:51:56.830 --> 03:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
goals on the reduction of waste by the
 
03:51:59.110 --> 03:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
middle of the century so not only is it
 
03:52:00.870 --> 03:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
currently a profitable industry it will
 
03:52:02.950 --> 03:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
continue to be so because we are not
 
03:52:04.670 --> 03:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
even coming close to meeting our
 
03:52:07.229 --> 03:52:07.239 align:start position:0%
reduction goals uh and and the amount of
 
03:52:10.110 --> 03:52:10.120 align:start position:0%
material we're continuing to to landfill
 
03:52:11.870 --> 03:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh is not going
 
03:52:15.830 --> 03:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
down represent dsy yes um Madam chairman
 
03:52:17.950 --> 03:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
may I make a point of clarification
 
03:52:21.790 --> 03:52:21.800 align:start position:0%
regarding um the land versus you know uh
 
03:52:26.189 --> 03:52:26.199 align:start position:0%
improving the land for the um um
 
03:52:29.189 --> 03:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
contractor in what way what do you mean
 
03:52:32.910 --> 03:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
well I used to sell RFP software okay so
 
03:52:34.590 --> 03:52:34.600 align:start position:0%
I understand the process a little bit
 
03:52:36.550 --> 03:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
and having you know been involved in
 
03:52:38.790 --> 03:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
County government but my understanding
 
03:52:40.870 --> 03:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
would would be that the state would
 
03:52:42.189 --> 03:52:42.199 align:start position:0%
issue an
 
03:52:45.870 --> 03:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
RFP putting out the scope of what they
 
03:52:49.990 --> 03:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
want contractors to um give them a price
 
03:52:54.830 --> 03:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
on okay so you send out the RFP and if
 
03:52:58.830 --> 03:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
the RFP is unreasonable and businesses
 
03:53:01.389 --> 03:53:01.399 align:start position:0%
can't make a profit off of it nobody
 
03:53:04.910 --> 03:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
responds so then what happens is the the
 
03:53:07.870 --> 03:53:07.880 align:start position:0%
state would go back and revise the RFP
 
03:53:10.870 --> 03:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
and say okay this didn't work so now
 
03:53:14.110 --> 03:53:14.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to put out a second RFP and
 
03:53:16.429 --> 03:53:16.439 align:start position:0%
again if no business responds because
 
03:53:18.630 --> 03:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
they can't make money the process just
 
03:53:22.429 --> 03:53:22.439 align:start position:0%
goes on you know so so basically you
 
03:53:24.110 --> 03:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
know the state might start out with
 
03:53:25.790 --> 03:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
saying okay we're just going to give you
 
03:53:27.830 --> 03:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
the land you do everything else nobody
 
03:53:30.670 --> 03:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
responds second one okay you know we're
 
03:53:32.750 --> 03:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
going to do the engineering the land the
 
03:53:35.510 --> 03:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
engineering work d d d d da and somebody
 
03:53:37.189 --> 03:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
responds and says yeah we can make money
 
03:53:40.149 --> 03:53:40.159 align:start position:0%
on it so I think that's the way the
 
03:53:43.750 --> 03:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
process would work um so it really is
 
03:53:46.830 --> 03:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
kind of an upfront negotiation and a
 
03:53:48.389 --> 03:53:48.399 align:start position:0%
business will respond when they know
 
03:53:51.830 --> 03:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
they can make a profit off of it
 
03:53:53.990 --> 03:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions for
 
03:53:54.000 --> 03:53:56.070 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions for
representative

03:53:56.070 --> 03:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:53:59.990 --> 03:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
gerana seeing none thank M
 
03:54:03.070 --> 03:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
chair I would like to call Kristen cotch
 
03:54:07.870 --> 03:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:07.880 --> 03:54:22.870 align:start position:0%
 
Association

03:54:22.870 --> 03:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:24.550 --> 03:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair members of
 
03:54:25.950 --> 03:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
the committee good
 
03:54:27.950 --> 03:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh for the record my name is
 
03:54:29.710 --> 03:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
Kirsten cotch I'm the vice president of
 
03:54:31.189 --> 03:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
public policy for the business and
 
03:54:33.870 --> 03:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
industry Association known as Bia we
 
03:54:35.710 --> 03:54:35.720 align:start position:0%
serve as the state's CH Statewide
 
03:54:38.189 --> 03:54:38.199 align:start position:0%
Chamber of Commerce um I'll keep my
 
03:54:40.229 --> 03:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
testimony very brief and just focus on
 
03:54:41.790 --> 03:54:41.800 align:start position:0%
the business Community perspective of
 
03:54:45.030 --> 03:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
this issue uh Bia is opposed to House
 
03:54:47.830 --> 03:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 1145 we have concerns that this
 
03:54:49.630 --> 03:54:49.640 align:start position:0%
bill would take away opportunities from
 
03:54:52.269 --> 03:54:52.279 align:start position:0%
the business Community we're concerned
 
03:54:53.990 --> 03:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
about the anti-business nature of this
 
03:54:56.229 --> 03:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
bill it would be a roadblock for future
 
03:54:57.950 --> 03:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
economic development for the solid waste
 
03:55:00.229 --> 03:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
industry and ultimately would hinder
 
03:55:02.910 --> 03:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
growth for the business community in New
 
03:55:05.030 --> 03:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh further we're concerned
 
03:55:06.550 --> 03:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
that one of the underlying purposes of
 
03:55:08.349 --> 03:55:08.359 align:start position:0%
this bill may be to stop a specific
 
03:55:09.990 --> 03:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
project from being developed in the
 
03:55:12.510 --> 03:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
future also I think there are some very
 
03:55:14.469 --> 03:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
vague portions of this bill it's a short
 
03:55:16.990 --> 03:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
bill it doesn't go into detail about um
 
03:55:18.630 --> 03:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
who would be paying for the development
 
03:55:20.510 --> 03:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
of landfills and how that process would
 
03:55:23.429 --> 03:55:23.439 align:start position:0%
work and just being able to contract and
 
03:55:25.149 --> 03:55:25.159 align:start position:0%
and operate landfills doesn't
 
03:55:27.269 --> 03:55:27.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily alleviate our concerns
 
03:55:28.670 --> 03:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
because there's still an opportunity
 
03:55:31.229 --> 03:55:31.239 align:start position:0%
being lost so in conclusion we
 
03:55:32.630 --> 03:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
respectfully requested the committee
 
03:55:35.070 --> 03:55:35.080 align:start position:0%
finds this bill inexpedient to legislate
 
03:55:36.550 --> 03:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
because it would limit opportunities for
 
03:55:38.110 --> 03:55:38.120 align:start position:0%
future Economic Development and
 
03:55:40.030 --> 03:55:40.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately weak week in New Hampshire's
 
03:55:42.149 --> 03:55:42.159 align:start position:0%
business climate thank you I'd be happy
 
03:55:44.030 --> 03:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
to try to answer any questions thank you
 
03:55:46.790 --> 03:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
for your testimony do you have written
 
03:55:51.790 --> 03:55:51.800 align:start position:0%
testimony or did no okay thanks um
 
03:55:54.229 --> 03:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
so the
 
03:55:56.790 --> 03:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
um the person who introduced the bill
 
03:55:59.269 --> 03:55:59.279 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby had mentioned that this
 
03:56:02.750 --> 03:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
is not what he considers not an anti-
 
03:56:06.910 --> 03:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
business bill because we would still be
 
03:56:09.670 --> 03:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
um Contracting
 
03:56:14.229 --> 03:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
uh waste management companies to run a
 
03:56:19.070 --> 03:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
business so how does that um comport
 
03:56:21.630 --> 03:56:21.640 align:start position:0%
with what you're saying is it being
 
03:56:25.070 --> 03:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
anti-business thank you so I mean your
 
03:56:28.630 --> 03:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
your thoughts are that a business would
 
03:56:30.189 --> 03:56:30.199 align:start position:0%
be discriminated against because they
 
03:56:31.990 --> 03:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
can't own the land that they're
 
03:56:34.990 --> 03:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
operating on thank you for the question
 
03:56:37.030 --> 03:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
I I think it's just that the opportunity
 
03:56:40.110 --> 03:56:40.120 align:start position:0%
is no longer there right they can't own
 
03:56:41.950 --> 03:56:41.960 align:start position:0%
a new landfill they they could be
 
03:56:44.189 --> 03:56:44.199 align:start position:0%
contracted to do something we don't know
 
03:56:46.469 --> 03:56:46.479 align:start position:0%
what that looks like or you know are
 
03:56:48.550 --> 03:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
they paying to develop it it's it's just
 
03:56:51.469 --> 03:56:51.479 align:start position:0%
all very unclear but our concern is that
 
03:56:53.550 --> 03:56:53.560 align:start position:0%
you know now the government is going to
 
03:56:56.269 --> 03:56:56.279 align:start position:0%
be doing this instead of
 
03:56:59.750 --> 03:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
business okay representative H Haskins
 
03:57:01.189 --> 03:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
03:57:04.389 --> 03:57:04.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question I think I um where
 
03:57:07.670 --> 03:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
I'm stuck is that the profit margin for
 
03:57:11.550 --> 03:57:11.560 align:start position:0%
this business is huge and so they could
 
03:57:14.189 --> 03:57:14.199 align:start position:0%
we would in fact need them to most
 
03:57:17.670 --> 03:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
likely operate a landfill and over many
 
03:57:19.590 --> 03:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
years of the life of a landfill they
 
03:57:21.750 --> 03:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
could be expected to make as much as1
 
03:57:25.910 --> 03:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
billion dollar so I'm really not sure
 
03:57:29.469 --> 03:57:29.479 align:start position:0%
what the harm to the industry or the
 
03:57:31.189 --> 03:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
business Community
 
03:57:33.990 --> 03:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
is could you
 
03:57:36.149 --> 03:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
elaborate um I think it again goes back
 
03:57:37.590 --> 03:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
to the fact that there's a lost
 
03:57:39.670 --> 03:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be the ones in control I
 
03:57:42.510 --> 03:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
mean they're just operating it's it's
 
03:57:45.349 --> 03:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
not the same
 
03:57:47.830 --> 03:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity represent H Haskins followup
 
03:57:49.830 --> 03:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you but they would reap the
 
03:57:52.349 --> 03:57:52.359 align:start position:0%
profits would they not the state is not
 
03:57:54.389 --> 03:57:54.399 align:start position:0%
getting the profits from the landfill
 
03:57:55.670 --> 03:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
the industry there's still an
 
03:57:58.830 --> 03:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to gain profit yes thank you
 
03:58:00.950 --> 03:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
03:58:03.070 --> 03:58:03.080 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
03:58:05.030 --> 03:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
um my question is around the idea and
 
03:58:07.590 --> 03:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
concept of public private Partnerships
 
03:58:10.670 --> 03:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
does your does does the Bia have other
 
03:58:13.389 --> 03:58:13.399 align:start position:0%
uh entities that uh participate in ppps
 
03:58:15.070 --> 03:58:15.080 align:start position:0%
or public private Partnerships of any
 
03:58:17.229 --> 03:58:17.239 align:start position:0%
kind thank you for the question I don't
 
03:58:18.510 --> 03:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
have the answer to that off the top of
 
03:58:18.520 --> 03:58:19.990 align:start position:0%
have the answer to that off the top of
my

03:58:19.990 --> 03:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
my
 
03:58:23.229 --> 03:58:23.239 align:start position:0%
head representative hkin uh Howard I'm
 
03:58:23.239 --> 03:58:24.870 align:start position:0%
head representative hkin uh Howard I'm
just

03:58:24.870 --> 03:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:58:28.469 --> 03:58:28.479 align:start position:0%
looking just to thank you madam chair um
 
03:58:30.710 --> 03:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
just to add just to put a finer point on
 
03:58:34.189 --> 03:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
what um representative of the hkin said
 
03:58:37.189 --> 03:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
um isn't there in fact a greater
 
03:58:39.750 --> 03:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
possibility for for profit given that
 
03:58:41.070 --> 03:58:41.080 align:start position:0%
you do not have to make the investment
 
03:58:41.950 --> 03:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:58:45.149 --> 03:58:45.159 align:start position:0%
land uh thank you for the question I I
 
03:58:46.630 --> 03:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
don't have the answer to that I don't
 
03:58:48.070 --> 03:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
think we know
 
03:58:53.030 --> 03:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:56.070 --> 03:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
question I just want um I just want to
 
03:58:58.229 --> 03:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
ask do you understand that the bill
 
03:59:00.990 --> 03:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
would actually it doesn't change how
 
03:59:03.149 --> 03:59:03.159 align:start position:0%
anything is operated right now except
 
03:59:06.389 --> 03:59:06.399 align:start position:0%
for the land the private company would
 
03:59:09.309 --> 03:59:09.319 align:start position:0%
still reap every bit of all the benefits
 
03:59:12.630 --> 03:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't hurt any of their profits
 
03:59:14.990 --> 03:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
so how could this hurt
 
03:59:17.550 --> 03:59:17.560 align:start position:0%
business thank you for the question well
 
03:59:19.510 --> 03:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
I think it was mentioned earlier that
 
03:59:21.910 --> 03:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
the state would just own the land so if
 
03:59:23.830 --> 03:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
business had to then develop an entire
 
03:59:26.590 --> 03:59:26.600 align:start position:0%
landfill and then lost the contract that
 
03:59:27.670 --> 03:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
introduces an element of
 
03:59:29.149 --> 03:59:29.159 align:start position:0%
unpredictability which is a real
 
03:59:31.469 --> 03:59:31.479 align:start position:0%
challenge for the long-term planning for
 
03:59:36.229 --> 03:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:38.670 --> 03:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
followup did you realize that most of
 
03:59:42.070 --> 03:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
these contracts with with the landfills
 
03:59:45.309 --> 03:59:45.319 align:start position:0%
are contracts of you know 20 30 year
 
03:59:45.319 --> 03:59:47.229 align:start position:0%
are contracts of you know 20 30 year
type

03:59:47.229 --> 03:59:47.239 align:start position:0%
type
 
03:59:50.349 --> 03:59:50.359 align:start position:0%
contracts so it's not like it they would
 
03:59:53.229 --> 03:59:53.239 align:start position:0%
have it and lose it overnight thank you
 
03:59:55.309 --> 03:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
for the question um I don't think we
 
03:59:57.229 --> 03:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
have a guarantee of that in this bill
 
04:00:00.910 --> 04:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
though represent Duty uh thank you madam
 
04:00:03.590 --> 04:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
chair so if I'm reading the tea leaves
 
04:00:07.830 --> 04:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing you say is that um the
 
04:00:10.510 --> 04:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
only thing that would change would be by
 
04:00:14.269 --> 04:00:14.279 align:start position:0%
the state being involved in the land um
 
04:00:16.269 --> 04:00:16.279 align:start position:0%
that there would be State oversight
 
04:00:18.030 --> 04:00:18.040 align:start position:0%
because the con because there would be a
 
04:00:21.110 --> 04:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
contract between the state and the waste
 
04:00:23.229 --> 04:00:23.239 align:start position:0%
management company and if the waste
 
04:00:25.710 --> 04:00:25.720 align:start position:0%
management company wasn't operating to
 
04:00:28.189 --> 04:00:28.199 align:start position:0%
the standards the state expected it
 
04:00:32.429 --> 04:00:32.439 align:start position:0%
could terminate that contract so um what
 
04:00:36.630 --> 04:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing is that maybe ba Bia is
 
04:00:39.469 --> 04:00:39.479 align:start position:0%
against State oversight of any business
 
04:00:41.950 --> 04:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
is that correct thank you for the
 
04:00:43.870 --> 04:00:43.880 align:start position:0%
question no we're not concerned about
 
04:00:45.790 --> 04:00:45.800 align:start position:0%
meeting the appropriate standards it's
 
04:00:47.790 --> 04:00:47.800 align:start position:0%
just a a change in the way things
 
04:00:50.110 --> 04:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
operate and again a lost opportunity to
 
04:00:52.550 --> 04:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
do this um have business do this
 
04:00:55.229 --> 04:00:55.239 align:start position:0%
themselves representive ktoa thank you
 
04:00:57.550 --> 04:00:57.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you again for
 
04:01:00.110 --> 04:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
being here and please bear with me while
 
04:01:04.030 --> 04:01:04.040 align:start position:0%
I ask this question um I have heard some
 
04:01:07.910 --> 04:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
information here that because the state
 
04:01:10.269 --> 04:01:10.279 align:start position:0%
would own the
 
04:01:12.990 --> 04:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
property and they would be contracting
 
04:01:15.790 --> 04:01:15.800 align:start position:0%
out the management of the
 
04:01:18.910 --> 04:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
landfill that the
 
04:01:21.189 --> 04:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in the land and the
 
04:01:23.990 --> 04:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
ownership of the property would get to
 
04:01:28.309 --> 04:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
pay a lower rate versus those that are
 
04:01:31.149 --> 04:01:31.159 align:start position:0%
out of state but we would be minimizing
 
04:01:32.950 --> 04:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
the amount of out of state waste that
 
04:01:36.910 --> 04:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
comes in here would that affect your
 
04:01:39.149 --> 04:01:39.159 align:start position:0%
profit thank you for the question I
 
04:01:41.750 --> 04:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
don't have the answer to that
 
04:01:45.030 --> 04:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
today any other questions from the
 
04:01:47.670 --> 04:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
committee no seeing none thank you very
 
04:01:49.710 --> 04:01:49.720 align:start position:0%

Happy Valentine's Day to everyone for
 
04:02:15.389 --> 04:02:15.399 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Tom Tower and I am
 
04:02:18.030 --> 04:02:18.040 align:start position:0%
representing North Country Alliance for
 
04:02:21.269 --> 04:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
balanced change speaking here in support
 
04:02:24.349 --> 04:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
of HB
 
04:02:28.670 --> 04:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
1145 uh I submitted my testimony online
 
04:02:30.630 --> 04:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
and it's been uploaded so you guys all
 
04:02:32.189 --> 04:02:32.199 align:start position:0%
have have access to it so I'll speak at
 
04:02:33.630 --> 04:02:33.640 align:start position:0%
a very high level there's been a lot of
 
04:02:37.149 --> 04:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
dialogue already around this
 
04:02:37.159 --> 04:02:39.309 align:start position:0%
dialogue already around this
topic

04:02:39.309 --> 04:02:39.319 align:start position:0%
topic
 
04:02:41.590 --> 04:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
everybody in the room has had a lot of
 
04:02:43.710 --> 04:02:43.720 align:start position:0%
Education whether you want it or not in
 
04:02:45.110 --> 04:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
regard to solid
 
04:02:48.110 --> 04:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
waste so let me start my testimony with
 
04:02:51.710 --> 04:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a story so round about
 
04:02:54.630 --> 04:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
38 years ago there was a decision in the
 
04:02:55.830 --> 04:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
04:03:00.389 --> 04:03:00.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to privatize Solid
 
04:03:03.149 --> 04:03:03.159 align:start position:0%
Waste I suspect that the rationale for
 
04:03:06.110 --> 04:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
doing it back then was probably a good
 
04:03:09.269 --> 04:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
idea now you fast forward 38 years and
 
04:03:11.389 --> 04:03:11.399 align:start position:0%
you go 20 years without an updated Solid
 
04:03:13.590 --> 04:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
Waste plan and what do we have we've got
 
04:03:16.149 --> 04:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
a disproportionate amount of out ofate
 
04:03:18.469 --> 04:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
waste now that's coming in because your
 
04:03:19.870 --> 04:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
surrounding states are putting the
 
04:03:21.550 --> 04:03:21.560 align:start position:0%
clamps on new
 
04:03:23.750 --> 04:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
landfills and New Hampshire seems to be
 
04:03:25.670 --> 04:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the funnel so let me
 
04:03:27.670 --> 04:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
put this in perspective a lot of the
 
04:03:31.110 --> 04:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
times people say you know
 
04:03:34.110 --> 04:03:34.120 align:start position:0%
um well New Hampshire exports Solid
 
04:03:37.429 --> 04:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
Waste as well well that's true but the
 
04:03:39.830 --> 04:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
last number that that I've seen and
 
04:03:42.189 --> 04:03:42.199 align:start position:0%
happy to hear anything to the contrary
 
04:03:43.870 --> 04:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
it's about
 
04:03:43.880 --> 04:03:45.590 align:start position:0%
it's about
5%

04:03:45.590 --> 04:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
5%
 
04:03:48.750 --> 04:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
um the opposite of that is that we are
 
04:03:52.469 --> 04:03:52.479 align:start position:0%
importing somewhere between 45 and
 
04:03:55.950 --> 04:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
50% so the intent of
 
04:04:01.149 --> 04:04:01.159 align:start position:0%
1145 here is to minimize that call it
 
04:04:03.710 --> 04:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
inequity in the amount of out ofate
 
04:04:06.990 --> 04:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
waste in comparison to what we are
 
04:04:07.000 --> 04:04:09.149 align:start position:0%
waste in comparison to what we are
exporting

04:04:09.149 --> 04:04:09.159 align:start position:0%
exporting
 
04:04:12.710 --> 04:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
the other piece of this in that is that
 
04:04:16.349 --> 04:04:16.359 align:start position:0%
if you we would not even be discussing
 
04:04:19.830 --> 04:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
any of this if out ofate waste wasn't an
 
04:04:22.830 --> 04:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
issue so the subcommittee that rep
 
04:04:27.469 --> 04:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
gerana spoke about and um was was uh
 
04:04:30.550 --> 04:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
membered by you know some senators and
 
04:04:32.389 --> 04:04:32.399 align:start position:0%
and and representative roacher here
 
04:04:33.550 --> 04:04:33.560 align:start position:0%
that's going to speak on another bill in
 
04:04:33.560 --> 04:04:34.469 align:start position:0%
that's going to speak on another bill in
a

04:04:34.469 --> 04:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:04:38.389 --> 04:04:38.399 align:start position:0%
moment their task was to look at ways to
 
04:04:40.750 --> 04:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
minimize the influx of out ofate waste
 
04:04:42.429 --> 04:04:42.439 align:start position:0%
and one of the proposals that seems to
 
04:04:45.590 --> 04:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
have Buy in from across the aisle was
 
04:04:49.870 --> 04:04:49.880 align:start position:0%
that we move to state-owned landfills
 
04:04:51.710 --> 04:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of questions around
 
04:04:55.389 --> 04:04:55.399 align:start position:0%
that it's you can debate it all day long
 
04:04:57.990 --> 04:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's not bad for business this happens
 
04:05:00.269 --> 04:05:00.279 align:start position:0%
all the time people lease out whether it
 
04:05:03.910 --> 04:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
be buildings or land they issue an
 
04:05:06.910 --> 04:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
RFP whoever wants to bid on it that has
 
04:05:08.790 --> 04:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
done due diligence thinks they can run a
 
04:05:11.149 --> 04:05:11.159 align:start position:0%
profitable business they basically bid
 
04:05:12.590 --> 04:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
on it and they come in and there are
 
04:05:14.870 --> 04:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
contracts like rep Penza said they could
 
04:05:17.790 --> 04:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
be 10 years 20 years two years 50 years
 
04:05:20.630 --> 04:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
it depends on the length of the contract
 
04:05:22.309 --> 04:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
but I don't see this as yanking the rug
 
04:05:23.990 --> 04:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
out from anybody because after two years
 
04:05:25.510 --> 04:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to get tossed after you in
 
04:05:27.590 --> 04:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
invest millions of dollars on a buildout
 
04:05:29.469 --> 04:05:29.479 align:start position:0%
are there savings well sure there's
 
04:05:31.189 --> 04:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
savings because the lands cost millions
 
04:05:33.990 --> 04:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
of dollars is there money in trash yes
 
04:05:36.750 --> 04:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
there's money in trash otherwise people
 
04:05:38.830 --> 04:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be managing in trash there's a
 
04:05:41.910 --> 04:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
lot of money in it listen to some of the
 
04:05:43.710 --> 04:05:43.720 align:start position:0%
uh the public companies earnings reports
 
04:05:45.670 --> 04:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
you'll find out what the margins are
 
04:05:47.070 --> 04:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
they are
 
04:05:50.309 --> 04:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
extensive so the intent of this bill is
 
04:05:52.510 --> 04:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
to minimize out ofate waste and if the
 
04:05:55.149 --> 04:05:55.159 align:start position:0%
state takes control of that from the
 
04:05:57.630 --> 04:05:57.640 align:start position:0%
perspective of owning the land then they
 
04:06:00.710 --> 04:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
can control the influx why because every
 
04:06:04.670 --> 04:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
time somebody asks the question um well
 
04:06:06.590 --> 04:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
why is there such a disproportionate
 
04:06:08.389 --> 04:06:08.399 align:start position:0%
amount of out ofate waste coming in New
 
04:06:09.870 --> 04:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know everybody said for
 
04:06:11.349 --> 04:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
the last 20 years because of the
 
04:06:12.710 --> 04:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce
 
04:06:16.110 --> 04:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
clause that's it okay end the story
 
04:06:18.030 --> 04:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
that's just you know that's that was the
 
04:06:21.550 --> 04:06:21.560 align:start position:0%
answer this is one mechanism and there's
 
04:06:22.910 --> 04:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of people that thought long and
 
04:06:25.229 --> 04:06:25.239 align:start position:0%
hard about it that it's a good
 
04:06:28.389 --> 04:06:28.399 align:start position:0%
mechanism it's also not unprecedented in
 
04:06:30.429 --> 04:06:30.439 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire right you
 
04:06:34.189 --> 04:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
take a look at Mount Sunapee many years
 
04:06:37.630 --> 04:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
ago Mount sunap entered into a contract
 
04:06:39.750 --> 04:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
with with a Colorado based company where
 
04:06:42.229 --> 04:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
Mount sunap actually is owned by the
 
04:06:45.510 --> 04:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
state but managed by the Colorado based
 
04:06:47.710 --> 04:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
company so it's not unprecedented that
 
04:06:50.389 --> 04:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing happens here in New
 
04:06:50.399 --> 04:06:52.870 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing happens here in New
Hampshire

04:06:52.870 --> 04:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:06:56.429 --> 04:06:56.439 align:start position:0%
so very briefly I'm here to S obviously
 
04:06:59.429 --> 04:06:59.439 align:start position:0%
urge you to support this bill um out
 
04:07:01.670 --> 04:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
ofate waste is the elephant in the room
 
04:07:03.630 --> 04:07:03.640 align:start position:0%
uh we probably wouldn't have talked for
 
04:07:05.309 --> 04:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
the last two days we still have more to
 
04:07:07.309 --> 04:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
talk about if we could solve this
 
04:07:10.110 --> 04:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
problem this is one way to do it are
 
04:07:12.309 --> 04:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
there complexities yes do I trust that
 
04:07:14.469 --> 04:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
the committee will work through them yes
 
04:07:16.189 --> 04:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
this is a good bill I urge you to
 
04:07:18.469 --> 04:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
support it and I'm happy to take any
 
04:07:18.479 --> 04:07:20.229 align:start position:0%
support it and I'm happy to take any
questions

04:07:20.229 --> 04:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:07:22.910 --> 04:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
sure um I have a question
 
04:07:25.389 --> 04:07:25.399 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned in what you're were
 
04:07:27.109 --> 04:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
saying that there's a lot of money in
 
04:07:30.630 --> 04:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
trash yeah certainly a lot then why
 
04:07:33.990 --> 04:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
would we want to limit the amount of out
 
04:07:36.910 --> 04:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
ofate trash why wouldn't we say bring it
 
04:07:38.349 --> 04:07:38.359 align:start position:0%
to us
 
04:07:41.389 --> 04:07:41.399 align:start position:0%
let us be the ones to make money on
 
04:07:44.870 --> 04:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
purifying it recycling it
 
04:07:48.030 --> 04:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
um doing a lot more other things other
 
04:07:51.990 --> 04:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
than landfilling it and make money on it
 
04:07:54.790 --> 04:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
that way and have our entrepreneurs make
 
04:07:57.109 --> 04:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
money on it that way thank you for the
 
04:08:00.309 --> 04:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
question Madam chair because right now
 
04:08:03.229 --> 04:08:03.239 align:start position:0%
it's dangerous you know we we shouldn't
 
04:08:06.149 --> 04:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
be pulling in all of this stuff that the
 
04:08:07.750 --> 04:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
the byproduct of which we don't even
 
04:08:10.309 --> 04:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
know what to do with you you you have
 
04:08:11.870 --> 04:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
all of this stuff that's that's coming
 
04:08:14.189 --> 04:08:14.199 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire it generates you know
 
04:08:15.990 --> 04:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
for every ton of trash it generates a
 
04:08:18.149 --> 04:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
ton of lee8 that lee8 is then
 
04:08:20.710 --> 04:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
transported down to conquered to some
 
04:08:23.670 --> 04:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
other waste you know water facility and
 
04:08:26.349 --> 04:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
then it's filtered and runs a lot of it
 
04:08:28.429 --> 04:08:28.439 align:start position:0%
into the meramac river of which both new
 
04:08:29.910 --> 04:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and New Hampshire people
 
04:08:31.790 --> 04:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
are drinking from and nobody knows what
 
04:08:35.030 --> 04:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
the heck to do with the posos so I would
 
04:08:37.229 --> 04:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
think that we would want to minimize the
 
04:08:39.870 --> 04:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
amount of trash that's coming in because
 
04:08:43.229 --> 04:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
it's a very dangerous business but I'm
 
04:08:46.910 --> 04:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
saying if we could use newest
 
04:08:49.750 --> 04:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
Technologies to figure out ways in which
 
04:08:53.269 --> 04:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
to um manage that trash coming from out
 
04:08:56.510 --> 04:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
of state that so it doesn't end up in
 
04:08:59.149 --> 04:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
landfills then we're still there's lots
 
04:09:01.349 --> 04:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
of money to be made in that don't you
 
04:09:04.670 --> 04:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
think um thank you for the question
 
04:09:06.550 --> 04:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I I would think that there
 
04:09:08.030 --> 04:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
is money in it and
 
04:09:11.229 --> 04:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
and what I'm thinking is that if the
 
04:09:15.109 --> 04:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
state would invest you know more time
 
04:09:15.119 --> 04:09:16.510 align:start position:0%
state would invest you know more time
into

04:09:16.510 --> 04:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:09:19.670 --> 04:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
diversion then you could eliminate a
 
04:09:21.149 --> 04:09:21.159 align:start position:0%
pretty significant problem and then
 
04:09:22.990 --> 04:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
there would be money in the management
 
04:09:27.149 --> 04:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
of it you know creating uh mechanisms to
 
04:09:29.710 --> 04:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
uh more effectively compost 30% of
 
04:09:31.349 --> 04:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
everything that goes into a landfill is
 
04:09:33.750 --> 04:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
food waste if we would have put that
 
04:09:35.830 --> 04:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in place guess what now
 
04:09:38.030 --> 04:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
we opened up a entire business
 
04:09:39.550 --> 04:09:39.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity for anybody that wants to
 
04:09:40.670 --> 04:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
get into the management of the
 
04:09:42.710 --> 04:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
composting business and it's the same
 
04:09:44.469 --> 04:09:44.479 align:start position:0%
with recycling but we need to do it
 
04:09:47.750 --> 04:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
safely so I would say yes Madam chair
 
04:09:50.469 --> 04:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
the there is an opportunity um we're not
 
04:09:52.790 --> 04:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
at that Tipping Point yet but when we
 
04:09:54.670 --> 04:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
are and that it becomes a profitable
 
04:09:56.269 --> 04:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
Venture for the for the State of New
 
04:09:57.790 --> 04:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would say then you would
 
04:10:01.269 --> 04:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
maybe open the door for more of it but
 
04:10:03.550 --> 04:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
this bill would give the state the
 
04:10:06.429 --> 04:10:06.439 align:start position:0%
ability to control when that door opens
 
04:10:06.439 --> 04:10:08.229 align:start position:0%
ability to control when that door opens
again

04:10:08.229 --> 04:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:10:11.109 --> 04:10:11.119 align:start position:0%
okay representative Howard thank you
 
04:10:13.630 --> 04:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
madam chair um if we were to eliminate
 
04:10:15.950 --> 04:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
the the income stream from importing
 
04:10:19.630 --> 04:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
trash would this still be an attractive
 
04:10:23.590 --> 04:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
business for uh contractors to take over
 
04:10:25.030 --> 04:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the uh question
 
04:10:27.109 --> 04:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
representative uh Howard that that that
 
04:10:29.070 --> 04:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
is a good question you know I I can't
 
04:10:31.630 --> 04:10:31.640 align:start position:0%
speak to at what critical mass at what
 
04:10:33.990 --> 04:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
Tipping Point does it turn from you know
 
04:10:36.189 --> 04:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
an unprofitable venture to a profitable
 
04:10:40.309 --> 04:10:40.319 align:start position:0%
Venture um but I do know that at some
 
04:10:43.070 --> 04:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
point there will be a need uh I
 
04:10:44.670 --> 04:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say at some point there will
 
04:10:46.870 --> 04:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
but there may be a need for for more
 
04:10:49.550 --> 04:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
landfills um and when that happens you'd
 
04:10:51.750 --> 04:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
have a contractor bid on it and if they
 
04:10:53.750 --> 04:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
have done they look at what is out there
 
04:10:55.710 --> 04:10:55.720 align:start position:0%
for critical mass and they assess
 
04:10:57.189 --> 04:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's a profitable you
 
04:11:00.590 --> 04:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
know venture or or or
 
04:11:03.070 --> 04:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
not represent
 
04:11:06.510 --> 04:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
dsy thank you madam chair um other than
 
04:11:08.630 --> 04:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
the law that we have that mercury can't
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
go into landfills uh what other
 
04:11:14.429 --> 04:11:14.439 align:start position:0%
recycling bills are you aware of that
 
04:11:16.429 --> 04:11:16.439 align:start position:0%
this legislature has passed over the
 
04:11:20.030 --> 04:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
last let's say 20 years uh for Source
 
04:11:22.070 --> 04:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
reduction thank you for the question
 
04:11:24.630 --> 04:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
representative Duty uh I have spent so
 
04:11:27.109 --> 04:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
much time on managing this aspect of
 
04:11:28.710 --> 04:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
solid waste management I can't speak
 
04:11:30.229 --> 04:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
intelligently on the amount of bills
 
04:11:32.469 --> 04:11:32.479 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire has has
 
04:11:34.630 --> 04:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
passed but I do know this we can get
 
04:11:35.990 --> 04:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
that information we'll be happy to
 
04:11:39.990 --> 04:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:44.309 --> 04:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:48.590 --> 04:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
kulan kind of piggybacking on what um uh
 
04:11:51.429 --> 04:11:51.439 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron had asked what do
 
04:11:53.469 --> 04:11:53.479 align:start position:0%
you think about the people of New
 
04:11:57.349 --> 04:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um in in wanting New Hampshire
 
04:12:01.309 --> 04:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
to be the mecca of New England
 
04:12:03.870 --> 04:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
trash I don't know if I should thank you
 
04:12:05.510 --> 04:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
for that question or not representative
 
04:12:08.790 --> 04:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
Penza and I'm not sure I know how to
 
04:12:11.149 --> 04:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
answer that um can you elaborate a
 
04:12:11.159 --> 04:12:12.590 align:start position:0%
answer that um can you elaborate a
little

04:12:12.590 --> 04:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
little
 
04:12:14.790 --> 04:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
further I live in Rochester and we have
 
04:12:18.109 --> 04:12:18.119 align:start position:0%
a landfill there and um every single
 
04:12:20.830 --> 04:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
person that I talk to every single one
 
04:12:23.990 --> 04:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
they have zero idea that we are taking
 
04:12:26.950 --> 04:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
in that amount of trash they have no
 
04:12:31.109 --> 04:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
idea the outcry is would be humongous um
 
04:12:32.710 --> 04:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire hey come to New
 
04:12:34.710 --> 04:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire We're The Dumping Ground right
 
04:12:37.229 --> 04:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
so you know if if we're going to use
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
music Technologies and all of that I'm
 
04:12:42.070 --> 04:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
all for it but shouldn't we be focused
 
04:12:44.910 --> 04:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire instead and then every
 
04:12:46.590 --> 04:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
other state could be focused on doing
 
04:12:48.870 --> 04:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
all those things for their
 
04:12:51.710 --> 04:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
trash yeah thank you for for for the
 
04:12:55.990 --> 04:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
question um no no question about it you
 
04:12:59.550 --> 04:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
know these things are very controversial
 
04:13:00.910 --> 04:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
and Lord knows we've all been talking
 
04:13:02.189 --> 04:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
about it for a long time many of you
 
04:13:03.469 --> 04:13:03.479 align:start position:0%
have sat on a number of different
 
04:13:05.189 --> 04:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
sessions on this
 
04:13:08.109 --> 04:13:08.119 align:start position:0%
committee um and the one
 
04:13:11.950 --> 04:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
I believe rallying cry or one of them
 
04:13:14.349 --> 04:13:14.359 align:start position:0%
anyway is that New Hampshire doesn't
 
04:13:17.510 --> 04:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
want to be the dump for New England New
 
04:13:18.750 --> 04:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doesn't want to be the dump
 
04:13:20.830 --> 04:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
for New England it's that simple why
 
04:13:24.070 --> 04:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
would we it makes no sense especially
 
04:13:25.830 --> 04:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
when when the the material that is
 
04:13:29.030 --> 04:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
coming into the state is a dangerous
 
04:13:32.790 --> 04:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
commodity it's it's it's very simple so
 
04:13:34.710 --> 04:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
we've worked real hard to try to get
 
04:13:36.630 --> 04:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
people to recognize that but I I haven't
 
04:13:38.309 --> 04:13:38.319 align:start position:0%
bumped into one person unless you have a
 
04:13:39.910 --> 04:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
vested interest in building a landfill
 
04:13:41.189 --> 04:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
on the state of New Hampshire when you
 
04:13:43.030 --> 04:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
say you know what everybody's dumping
 
04:13:44.469 --> 04:13:44.479 align:start position:0%
all that crap in New Hampshire what do
 
04:13:48.750 --> 04:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
you think everybody says what I can't
 
04:13:51.910 --> 04:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
believe that and that's the truth of
 
04:13:53.950 --> 04:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
this and that's part of what we've been
 
04:13:58.389 --> 04:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
trying to reinforce representative
 
04:14:00.630 --> 04:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
kulan thank you madam chair and thank
 
04:14:02.710 --> 04:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh when I
 
04:14:06.349 --> 04:14:06.359 align:start position:0%
read this bill I see a need for Consumer
 
04:14:08.269 --> 04:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
Protections so you talked a little bit
 
04:14:11.149 --> 04:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
about public private Partnerships Mount
 
04:14:14.070 --> 04:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
sunap well you know if sunap or gun
 
04:14:17.349 --> 04:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
stock charged $500 for a lift ticket and
 
04:14:19.990 --> 04:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
was publicly owned that wouldn't be you
 
04:14:22.590 --> 04:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
know very good for the public so you
 
04:14:25.710 --> 04:14:25.720 align:start position:0%
know with waste we pay per ton market
 
04:14:28.870 --> 04:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
rate so if we were potentially to have
 
04:14:31.349 --> 04:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh publicly owned landfills you think it
 
04:14:34.590 --> 04:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
would be fair to have the price locked
 
04:14:37.149 --> 04:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
into the lowest possible market rate or
 
04:14:39.349 --> 04:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
do you think that you know the rate
 
04:14:43.229 --> 04:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
should be high or how do you think the
 
04:14:44.790 --> 04:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
charge on that should go there the
 
04:14:46.910 --> 04:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
pricing structure yeah no thank you for
 
04:14:49.870 --> 04:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
that question uh I am not an advocate of
 
04:14:51.870 --> 04:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
you know the state controlling you know
 
04:14:53.590 --> 04:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
pricing I I do believe in the free
 
04:14:55.309 --> 04:14:55.319 align:start position:0%
enterprise system and I think that the
 
04:14:57.950 --> 04:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
market is going to dictate that pricing
 
04:15:01.309 --> 04:15:01.319 align:start position:0%
um and that would be my response to your
 
04:15:03.910 --> 04:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
question any other questions from the
 
04:15:07.229 --> 04:15:07.239 align:start position:0%
committee thank you appreciate it thank
 
04:15:08.870 --> 04:15:08.880 align:start position:0%

I'm Sarah uas Kern and I serve as the
 
04:15:32.550 --> 04:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
assistant director of the waste
 
04:15:34.830 --> 04:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
management division at New Hampshire
 
04:15:37.710 --> 04:15:37.720 align:start position:0%
Dees and with me I have have Leah
 
04:15:40.309 --> 04:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
McKenna the administrator of the solid
 
04:15:43.149 --> 04:15:43.159 align:start position:0%
waste management Bureau at Dees thank
 
04:15:45.510 --> 04:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to testify on
 
04:15:46.910 --> 04:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:15:49.910 --> 04:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
1145 Dees is not taking a position on
 
04:15:53.189 --> 04:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
this bill uh but we have some concerns
 
04:15:54.750 --> 04:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
about how the bill could impact New
 
04:15:57.349 --> 04:15:57.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Solid Waste Disposal market
 
04:15:59.990 --> 04:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
and how in turn it could economically
 
04:16:02.870 --> 04:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
affect New Hampshire communities and
 
04:16:05.990 --> 04:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
businesses our concerns about potential
 
04:16:08.510 --> 04:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
disruption of the Solid Waste Market
 
04:16:12.830 --> 04:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
Center around the observation that
 
04:16:16.269 --> 04:16:16.279 align:start position:0%
public entities may not opt to obtain
 
04:16:18.070 --> 04:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
permits to build new
 
04:16:20.670 --> 04:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
landfills reasons why an entity might
 
04:16:23.309 --> 04:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
not elect to construct a landfill
 
04:16:25.429 --> 04:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
include concerns about
 
04:16:28.269 --> 04:16:28.279 align:start position:0%
liability the lack of a suitable
 
04:16:31.910 --> 04:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
site inability to obtain financing
 
04:16:34.070 --> 04:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
inability to obtain local
 
04:16:37.269 --> 04:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
support and for political subdivision
 
04:16:39.269 --> 04:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
concerns about the type of expertise
 
04:16:41.630 --> 04:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
that might be
 
04:16:45.510 --> 04:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
needed if public entities do not opt to
 
04:16:47.950 --> 04:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
get permits to construct new
 
04:16:50.550 --> 04:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
landfills and this bill is enacted this
 
04:16:53.389 --> 04:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
could lead to a supply pressures on the
 
04:16:55.670 --> 04:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
solid waste disposal Market which could
 
04:16:59.229 --> 04:16:59.239 align:start position:0%
drive up the cost for solid waste
 
04:17:02.229 --> 04:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
disposal my testimony is brief and uh I
 
04:17:03.830 --> 04:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
would be happy to take any questions
 
04:17:04.990 --> 04:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
that you
 
04:17:08.510 --> 04:17:08.520 align:start position:0%

in play right now with
 
04:17:23.070 --> 04:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
um privately run landfills you're right
 
04:17:25.590 --> 04:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
that those would be a concern for any
 
04:17:29.670 --> 04:17:29.680 align:start position:0%

04:19:23.030 --> 04:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
short as I can because I think a lot of
 
04:19:24.990 --> 04:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
the points that I'm I I'm going to talk
 
04:19:28.710 --> 04:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
about have been made um the bill
 
04:19:30.790 --> 04:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
1632 actually let me go back a little
 
04:19:32.990 --> 04:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
bit here so one of the things I think
 
04:19:35.030 --> 04:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
that if you if you took a look at what I
 
04:19:37.950 --> 04:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
sent um yesterday today I sent you about
 
04:19:42.349 --> 04:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
six pages of 124 pages but the the the
 
04:19:43.950 --> 04:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
question that has come up when we talk
 
04:19:45.590 --> 04:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
about out of state trash and just to
 
04:19:49.870 --> 04:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
Echo what was heard in the previous um
 
04:19:51.870 --> 04:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
testimony people are appalled at the
 
04:19:53.229 --> 04:19:53.239 align:start position:0%
amount of out of state trash that's
 
04:19:55.269 --> 04:19:55.279 align:start position:0%
coming into New Hampshire and you know
 
04:19:58.429 --> 04:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
as a as a uh somebody from the North
 
04:20:00.750 --> 04:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
Country who has constituents up there
 
04:20:03.349 --> 04:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
you were often asked hey what what can
 
04:20:07.109 --> 04:20:07.119 align:start position:0%
we do about it and for long time we were
 
04:20:09.590 --> 04:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
operating under the presumption that the
 
04:20:11.910 --> 04:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
Commerce Clause inhibits our ability to
 
04:20:16.469 --> 04:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
do anything about that U so we addressed
 
04:20:18.309 --> 04:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
in the in our committee over the summer
 
04:20:19.630 --> 04:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
we brought in the Attorney General's
 
04:20:21.550 --> 04:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
office because we specifically wanted to
 
04:20:23.750 --> 04:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
take a deep dive into that because we
 
04:20:26.670 --> 04:20:26.680 align:start position:0%
identified areas where the Commerce
 
04:20:29.229 --> 04:20:29.239 align:start position:0%
Clause were where we could identify
 
04:20:31.269 --> 04:20:31.279 align:start position:0%
things that there were differences
 
04:20:33.429 --> 04:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
different treatments given to people
 
04:20:36.109 --> 04:20:36.119 align:start position:0%
from out of state versus inst State you
 
04:20:38.630 --> 04:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
know I'm a I'm a deer hunter uh I buy an
 
04:20:40.469 --> 04:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
instate deer hunting license and it's
 
04:20:42.070 --> 04:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
one price but a non-resident deer
 
04:20:43.990 --> 04:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
hunting license is more expensive an
 
04:20:46.070 --> 04:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
instate fishing license is one price but
 
04:20:47.830 --> 04:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
the out ofate fishing license is more
 
04:20:49.790 --> 04:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
expensive as a pharmacist I'm a
 
04:20:52.189 --> 04:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
professional instate Pharmacy licenses
 
04:20:54.790 --> 04:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
Are One Price non-resident Pharmacy
 
04:20:56.870 --> 04:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
prices are the other price and we asked
 
04:20:58.750 --> 04:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General so why you know if
 
04:21:00.149 --> 04:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
there's the Commerce Clause that says
 
04:21:02.030 --> 04:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
everybody has to be treated equal why is
 
04:21:04.950 --> 04:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
there this disparity and um he said well
 
04:21:06.590 --> 04:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
actually there's a way there are
 
04:21:10.030 --> 04:21:10.040 align:start position:0%
criteria if met that it's not a blanket
 
04:21:13.630 --> 04:21:13.640 align:start position:0%
you can't do this and uh that's spelled
 
04:21:16.550 --> 04:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
out in the the the handout that I gave
 
04:21:20.910 --> 04:21:20.920 align:start position:0%
out uh yesterday and they identified
 
04:21:23.510 --> 04:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
three criteria it's called The Balancing
 
04:21:25.950 --> 04:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
of benefits and if three criteria can be
 
04:21:29.269 --> 04:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
met by the state then the
 
04:21:32.109 --> 04:21:32.119 align:start position:0%
benefits are balanced the the benefits
 
04:21:34.269 --> 04:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
are more beneficial to the state than
 
04:21:37.030 --> 04:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
they are to an out of state person for
 
04:21:38.670 --> 04:21:38.680 align:start position:0%
instance you know the the state of New
 
04:21:41.590 --> 04:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we have fishing game
 
04:21:43.590 --> 04:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
officers that we pay out of the general
 
04:21:46.870 --> 04:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
fund uh or part of our budget um that
 
04:21:50.109 --> 04:21:50.119 align:start position:0%
are funded uh and and and that's why we
 
04:21:51.750 --> 04:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
can charge more for hunting licenses you
 
04:21:53.830 --> 04:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
know they use our roads they use our
 
04:21:55.950 --> 04:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
equipment they so there's a balancing of
 
04:21:59.269 --> 04:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
benefits if you will so when we pose the
 
04:21:59.279 --> 04:22:00.510 align:start position:0%
benefits if you will so when we pose the
question

04:22:00.510 --> 04:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:22:04.630 --> 04:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
to um Mr whims hat he he came up and uh
 
04:22:07.229 --> 04:22:07.239 align:start position:0%
testified at our meeting and we asked
 
04:22:08.830 --> 04:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
the the we asked about the balancing of
 
04:22:11.189 --> 04:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
benefits benefits and we posed the
 
04:22:13.950 --> 04:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
question can these three be met very off
 
04:22:15.630 --> 04:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
the top of his head said absolutely two
 
04:22:17.349 --> 04:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
two out of the three can ve be very
 
04:22:19.590 --> 04:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
easily met we could prove that case very
 
04:22:22.670 --> 04:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
easily to limit out of state trash um
 
04:22:24.189 --> 04:22:24.199 align:start position:0%
and he said the third he said you know
 
04:22:26.830 --> 04:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
that would be a question of uh um you
 
04:22:29.349 --> 04:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
know to further explore but he wasn't
 
04:22:33.189 --> 04:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
you wasn't to know answer out of that so
 
04:22:35.070 --> 04:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
that being said we went then went back
 
04:22:37.510 --> 04:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
and took that information said well if
 
04:22:39.830 --> 04:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
we can do this if there's if there's
 
04:22:42.269 --> 04:22:42.279 align:start position:0%
basis for doing this and if it's not a
 
04:22:46.469 --> 04:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue anymore um then
 
04:22:50.309 --> 04:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
then we should pursue this so what 1632
 
04:22:52.670 --> 04:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
does is it says any new landfills we
 
04:22:55.670 --> 04:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
we're not going to again being you know
 
04:22:58.229 --> 04:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh sympathetic to to the businesses that
 
04:23:00.670 --> 04:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
are conducting business in the state you
 
04:23:03.070 --> 04:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
we don't want to um pull the rug out
 
04:23:04.229 --> 04:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
from under them we want to let them
 
04:23:05.870 --> 04:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
continue on their business model but any
 
04:23:08.790 --> 04:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
new landfills permitted uh this bill
 
04:23:10.750 --> 04:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
just says that they cannot accept any
 
04:23:14.870 --> 04:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
more than 15% of waste from out of state
 
04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
and where does the 15% come from well I
 
04:23:19.830 --> 04:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
got to be very honest with you this was
 
04:23:21.389 --> 04:23:21.399 align:start position:0%
Bill that we there was some
 
04:23:23.070 --> 04:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
miscommunication amongst the committee
 
04:23:25.550 --> 04:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
members uh who was going to file this
 
04:23:27.710 --> 04:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
and with seven minutes left before the
 
04:23:31.710 --> 04:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
filing deadline I put the bill in um
 
04:23:33.429 --> 04:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
with the permission of the speaker uh
 
04:23:35.990 --> 04:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
lot lot was uh uh we we we asked
 
04:23:39.070 --> 04:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
permission to do this so I picked the
 
04:23:43.309 --> 04:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
15% um quite frankly out of the air but
 
04:23:45.510 --> 04:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh thinking that the uh the the
 
04:23:47.790 --> 04:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
committee would have the time to to work
 
04:23:50.630 --> 04:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
that out but I have had time to research
 
04:23:55.149 --> 04:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
this and so looking back at how much how
 
04:23:57.510 --> 04:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
much trash are we taking from out of
 
04:24:01.309 --> 04:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
state um in 2014 the best management
 
04:24:02.750 --> 04:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
practices of the New Hampshire Solid
 
04:24:04.990 --> 04:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
Waste facilities uh which was prepared
 
04:24:07.229 --> 04:24:07.239 align:start position:0%
by the solid waste compliance Assurance
 
04:24:09.910 --> 04:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
section um
 
04:24:13.710 --> 04:24:13.720 align:start position:0%
said we approximately import 5% excuse
 
04:24:16.269 --> 04:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
me we
 
04:24:19.309 --> 04:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
we I'm I may be misspoke export versus
 
04:24:21.830 --> 04:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
import we import obviously as we know
 
04:24:24.229 --> 04:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
about 50% but how much are we exporting
 
04:24:26.349 --> 04:24:26.359 align:start position:0%
because the question is when we come up
 
04:24:29.269 --> 04:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
with this 15% it should be fair to what
 
04:24:33.229 --> 04:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
we're doing if we're importing uh excuse
 
04:24:37.070 --> 04:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
me if we're we're exporting 50 % it
 
04:24:39.830 --> 04:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
would be unfair of us to make the
 
04:24:43.070 --> 04:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
Imports any more restrictive than that
 
04:24:46.030 --> 04:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
so when when we found out where that
 
04:24:47.550 --> 04:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
understanding where that 15% and see if
 
04:24:49.590 --> 04:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
that's a valid number looking at this
 
04:24:52.309 --> 04:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
report from 2014 I know the previous
 
04:24:54.830 --> 04:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
testimony said this U this report said
 
04:24:58.070 --> 04:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
approximately 5% of our trash is
 
04:25:00.189 --> 04:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
exported this was in
 
04:25:02.510 --> 04:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
2014 and that
 
04:25:06.189 --> 04:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
5% U going back to 1980 was largely un
 
04:25:08.830 --> 04:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
change there was ups and downs and there
 
04:25:10.429 --> 04:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
were a little bit of changes depending
 
04:25:13.670 --> 04:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
on the year so that was a for 2014 that
 
04:25:17.950 --> 04:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
was um fairly old so I found in the
 
04:25:20.030 --> 04:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
biannual Solid Waste report in October
 
04:25:22.269 --> 04:25:22.279 align:start position:0%
of 2019 this is the most recent number
 
04:25:24.469 --> 04:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
that I could put my hands on this was by
 
04:25:27.389 --> 04:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services it said Dees
 
04:25:29.510 --> 04:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
attempted to account for all Solid Waste
 
04:25:31.229 --> 04:25:31.239 align:start position:0%
generated within New Hampshire destined
 
04:25:33.910 --> 04:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
for disposal by including the amount of
 
04:25:35.590 --> 04:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
solid waste generated in New Hampshire
 
04:25:38.830 --> 04:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
that is exported to Solid Waste
 
04:25:42.790 --> 04:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
facilities um the average export rate
 
04:25:45.590 --> 04:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
for solid waste during this they went
 
04:25:49.349 --> 04:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
back 17 years was 10% and the standard
 
04:25:51.469 --> 04:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
deviation was about
 
04:25:56.030 --> 04:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
14% so the number that I came up with in
 
04:26:00.229 --> 04:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
1632 limiting Imports to 15% is an
 
04:26:02.870 --> 04:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
equitable number that's that's relative
 
04:26:05.590 --> 04:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
to how much that we're we're exporting
 
04:26:07.870 --> 04:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
um it's not lost on me the fact that we
 
04:26:11.309 --> 04:26:11.319 align:start position:0%
don't take care of everything in State
 
04:26:13.309 --> 04:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
uh and and we wanted to be you know
 
04:26:17.469 --> 04:26:17.479 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to that so that's um that's
 
04:26:19.309 --> 04:26:19.319 align:start position:0%
where that number came from I know I've
 
04:26:23.109 --> 04:26:23.119 align:start position:0%
had a lot of people ask me about that so
 
04:26:25.550 --> 04:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
going forward we feel comfortable that
 
04:26:29.070 --> 04:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
this this bill if enacted would meet the
 
04:26:30.790 --> 04:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
three criteria that have to be met the
 
04:26:32.389 --> 04:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
balancing of benefits in the Commerce
 
04:26:36.070 --> 04:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
Clause we feel that the 15% limit on
 
04:26:38.149 --> 04:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
non-resident trash coming into New
 
04:26:41.149 --> 04:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire any newly permitted facilities
 
04:26:45.189 --> 04:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
would be adequate um and uh and and we
 
04:26:48.349 --> 04:26:48.359 align:start position:0%
feel that this would deliver the
 
04:26:50.710 --> 04:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
solution that our constituents are
 
04:26:52.790 --> 04:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
wanting I think that representative
 
04:26:55.309 --> 04:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
Penza who's left you know her the the
 
04:26:57.469 --> 04:26:57.479 align:start position:0%
what her constituents say is the same
 
04:26:59.349 --> 04:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
thing that M mine do we can't believe
 
04:27:02.349 --> 04:27:02.359 align:start position:0%
how much trash we we put in our our our
 
04:27:04.710 --> 04:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
facilities I would ask I know I've
 
04:27:06.910 --> 04:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
spoken to representative J about this to
 
04:27:08.950 --> 04:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
tune up a little bit the definition of
 
04:27:10.790 --> 04:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
out ofate I think that he's prepared to
 
04:27:13.469 --> 04:27:13.479 align:start position:0%
offer an amendment at that time um and
 
04:27:15.469 --> 04:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
we can do that but I would take any
 
04:27:17.189 --> 04:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
questions that the the committee might
 
04:27:21.309 --> 04:27:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:23.710 --> 04:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
kraton thank you for your testimony and
 
04:27:25.550 --> 04:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
your hard work on trying to make this
 
04:27:28.510 --> 04:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
work I'm just trying to
 
04:27:31.389 --> 04:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
square you said that there's no impact
 
04:27:33.070 --> 04:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
from a business perspective even though
 
04:27:34.670 --> 04:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
you're taking
 
04:27:38.630 --> 04:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
away the 35% if you use your number 50
 
04:27:41.990 --> 04:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
down to 15 so
 
04:27:45.670 --> 04:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's money coming in to the waste
 
04:27:48.109 --> 04:27:48.119 align:start position:0%
facilities from out of state that's
 
04:27:51.510 --> 04:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
representing 35% of their
 
04:27:54.070 --> 04:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
overall prod and and I think how is that
 
04:27:56.389 --> 04:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
not an impact well and I think that this
 
04:27:56.399 --> 04:27:57.510 align:start position:0%
not an impact well and I think that this
that

04:27:57.510 --> 04:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:27:59.670 --> 04:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
correlates you're absolutely right in
 
04:28:01.109 --> 04:28:01.119 align:start position:0%
that point but going back to what the
 
04:28:02.790 --> 04:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
committee one of the recommendations of
 
04:28:06.030 --> 04:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
the committee was in conjunction with
 
04:28:09.309 --> 04:28:09.319 align:start position:0%
this the state really focus on I think
 
04:28:11.950 --> 04:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
the chair hit on this a few minutes ago
 
04:28:15.389 --> 04:28:15.399 align:start position:0%
is uh making our abilities and our our
 
04:28:18.590 --> 04:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
facilities uh for advanced Recycling
 
04:28:21.030 --> 04:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
incineration and and really focusing on
 
04:28:23.590 --> 04:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
on making those more robust and working
 
04:28:25.710 --> 04:28:25.720 align:start position:0%
with opportunities there so where you
 
04:28:29.429 --> 04:28:29.439 align:start position:0%
may be losing opportunity in one one
 
04:28:32.030 --> 04:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
bucket the goal would be to increase
 
04:28:34.109 --> 04:28:34.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity in the other and the other
 
04:28:36.990 --> 04:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
thing to speak to on that is really this
 
04:28:39.750 --> 04:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
you know we we think about um if this is
 
04:28:41.030 --> 04:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
met this was actually this would
 
04:28:43.189 --> 04:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
actually we we figure would actually
 
04:28:45.950 --> 04:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
extend the life of some of our
 
04:28:48.349 --> 04:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
facilities that we have now so where a
 
04:28:50.070 --> 04:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
facility may only be able to operate
 
04:28:51.830 --> 04:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
over a certain given a time it's full
 
04:28:54.269 --> 04:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
and then it's over by limiting this you
 
04:28:56.510 --> 04:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
actually extend the life and opportunity
 
04:28:59.750 --> 04:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
to to to to to earn for a longer period
 
04:29:04.710 --> 04:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
of time follow follow up but it fair
 
04:29:04.720 --> 04:29:06.269 align:start position:0%
of time follow follow up but it fair
enough

04:29:06.269 --> 04:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
enough
 
04:29:08.109 --> 04:29:08.119 align:start position:0%
but is there anything that says that
 
04:29:11.429 --> 04:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
they can be profitable losing in with
 
04:29:13.710 --> 04:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
your numbers 35% of their
 
04:29:16.510 --> 04:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
input you the committee didn't explore
 
04:29:19.030 --> 04:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
profitability of businesses um you know
 
04:29:21.630 --> 04:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
the committee was tasked with how do we
 
04:29:23.830 --> 04:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
control out ofate waste so you know
 
04:29:25.550 --> 04:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
profitability was not addressed in in
 
04:29:28.870 --> 04:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
the committee okay and and so just to
 
04:29:31.910 --> 04:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
clarify again because of
 
04:29:34.710 --> 04:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
the concept of balancing of
 
04:29:39.469 --> 04:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
benefits limiting it to 15% or some
 
04:29:43.910 --> 04:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
number is not going to um be on constit
 
04:29:43.920 --> 04:29:44.910 align:start position:0%
number is not going to um be on constit
considered

04:29:44.910 --> 04:29:44.920 align:start position:0%
considered
 
04:29:47.389 --> 04:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional as long as the three
 
04:29:50.630 --> 04:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
and and I I I I I gave you the um the
 
04:29:52.510 --> 04:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
brief from the attorney Assistant
 
04:29:55.070 --> 04:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and what was
 
04:29:57.189 --> 04:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
given to us that balancing of benefits
 
04:29:59.070 --> 04:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
there are three criteria I believe is a
 
04:30:01.630 --> 04:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
pike case uh that have to be met if
 
04:30:04.750 --> 04:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
those three criteria are met then there
 
04:30:07.950 --> 04:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
that alleviates it's the Constitutional
 
04:30:10.269 --> 04:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
uh concern Attorney General's office
 
04:30:12.030 --> 04:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
sent you a memo regarding that yeah
 
04:30:13.109 --> 04:30:13.119 align:start position:0%
actually I G I don't know if you have
 
04:30:15.429 --> 04:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
what I gave you yesterday um on that
 
04:30:18.510 --> 04:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
it's uh it was from uh it's dated
 
04:30:21.389 --> 04:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
December 14 2021 from K Allen Brooks he
 
04:30:23.870 --> 04:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
actually came and testified uh to the to
 
04:30:25.630 --> 04:30:25.640 align:start position:0%
the committee if you don't have that
 
04:30:27.309 --> 04:30:27.319 align:start position:0%
I'll leave this with you I would like to
 
04:30:29.670 --> 04:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
another I can I can leave that withk
 
04:30:33.590 --> 04:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
other questions represent Bixby yes so
 
04:30:36.790 --> 04:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
um and one of the other
 
04:30:40.189 --> 04:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
another aspect of looking at that
 
04:30:44.309 --> 04:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
35 or 35 remaining percent of uh out of
 
04:30:47.710 --> 04:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
state waste that might be excluded uh
 
04:30:51.229 --> 04:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
are there not uh impacts of that waste
 
04:30:53.189 --> 04:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire where New Hampshire
 
04:30:56.389 --> 04:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
resources are being used to deal with
 
04:30:58.750 --> 04:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
that out ofate waste things like you
 
04:31:01.349 --> 04:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
know the what happens when that goes
 
04:31:03.590 --> 04:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
into Municipal the when the lee8 goes
 
04:31:06.590 --> 04:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
into Municipal uh
 
04:31:08.349 --> 04:31:08.359 align:start position:0%
uh water treatment plants and then get
 
04:31:11.830 --> 04:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
spread on our Fields what happens when
 
04:31:14.349 --> 04:31:14.359 align:start position:0%
uh there are potent what happens when
 
04:31:17.750 --> 04:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
there need to be regulatory actions by
 
04:31:22.670 --> 04:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
Dees that our taxpayer money is paying
 
04:31:25.189 --> 04:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
for so that that I think goes back to
 
04:31:27.429 --> 04:31:27.439 align:start position:0%
that balancing of benefits right I mean
 
04:31:30.149 --> 04:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
that that that all of that waste that's
 
04:31:33.510 --> 04:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
coming in by cutting that out out or or
 
04:31:37.030 --> 04:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
reducing that that's to the benefit of
 
04:31:39.030 --> 04:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in many and you can make
 
04:31:40.429 --> 04:31:40.439 align:start position:0%
that case in many you know our roads
 
04:31:42.349 --> 04:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
aren't getting used as much you know
 
04:31:44.830 --> 04:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
there's a you know the the the the
 
04:31:47.389 --> 04:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
potential for wa water quality or water
 
04:31:49.429 --> 04:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
issues decreases you know the stuff
 
04:31:51.510 --> 04:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's coming in a lot of it is the
 
04:31:53.670 --> 04:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
worst stuff you know that that they
 
04:31:55.229 --> 04:31:55.239 align:start position:0%
don't they don't there's a reason they
 
04:31:57.830 --> 04:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
don't want it in Massachusetts and and
 
04:31:59.910 --> 04:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
Connecticut because it's bulky it's
 
04:32:02.349 --> 04:32:02.359 align:start position:0%
construction waste it's it's it's uh
 
04:32:04.630 --> 04:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
it's stuff that you know it's not you
 
04:32:07.109 --> 04:32:07.119 align:start position:0%
know it consumes a lot of space in their
 
04:32:09.109 --> 04:32:09.119 align:start position:0%
their landfill so I think going back to
 
04:32:10.750 --> 04:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
that that that that's an argument right
 
04:32:12.550 --> 04:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
there that you just mentioned is the
 
04:32:14.429 --> 04:32:14.439 align:start position:0%
balancing of benefits I mean there is
 
04:32:17.389 --> 04:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
benefit to keeping that out there's
 
04:32:19.189 --> 04:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
benefit to New Hampshire and New
 
04:32:21.030 --> 04:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents and New Hampshire
 
04:32:25.910 --> 04:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:28.630 --> 04:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative Murray thank
 
04:32:30.349 --> 04:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for taking
 
04:32:32.429 --> 04:32:32.439 align:start position:0%
my question would it be fair to say that
 
04:32:34.870 --> 04:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
probably since around the 1980s that
 
04:32:37.750 --> 04:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
some of our neighboring states have used
 
04:32:40.670 --> 04:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
that balance of benefit kind of
 
04:32:43.950 --> 04:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
conversation to enact other things like
 
04:32:45.910 --> 04:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
disposal by permit for certain types of
 
04:32:49.469 --> 04:32:49.479 align:start position:0%
things or uh dumping search charges uh
 
04:32:51.469 --> 04:32:51.479 align:start position:0%
for disposal of certain types of things
 
04:32:55.590 --> 04:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
that have uh in in somewhat kind
 
04:32:58.910 --> 04:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
of created the burden that we are now
 
04:33:01.309 --> 04:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
facing yeah I think that's fair to say
 
04:33:02.630 --> 04:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
yes and I think they they have been
 
04:33:04.349 --> 04:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
creative and you look at what some of
 
04:33:06.390 --> 04:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
our bordering states have done whether
 
04:33:08.629 --> 04:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
it's you know the ownership structures
 
04:33:10.390 --> 04:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
or organizational structures that
 
04:33:12.750 --> 04:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
they've employed um they certainly are
 
04:33:14.949 --> 04:33:14.959 align:start position:0%
using that to balance the
 
04:33:19.349 --> 04:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
benefit uh uh of their trash situation
 
04:33:23.189 --> 04:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
yeah representative ger and then dosy
 
04:33:24.510 --> 04:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:33:26.629 --> 04:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
04:33:28.590 --> 04:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
it it was the unanimous bipartisan
 
04:33:30.230 --> 04:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
conclusion of the committee that we
 
04:33:32.070 --> 04:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
should make efforts to reduce out of
 
04:33:34.830 --> 04:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
state trash correct yeah unequivocally
 
04:33:37.510 --> 04:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
yes and and did did if may I follow up
 
04:33:39.189 --> 04:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you uh and did the
 
04:33:41.070 --> 04:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
committee hear from a single person who
 
04:33:44.109 --> 04:33:44.119 align:start position:0%
told us that it was not imperative to
 
04:33:46.590 --> 04:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
reduce outof State waste coming into New
 
04:33:49.670 --> 04:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no I don't believe anybody
 
04:33:51.789 --> 04:33:51.799 align:start position:0%
anybody came and said it's not a not not
 
04:33:55.709 --> 04:33:55.719 align:start position:0%
an issue thank you yeah represent dsy
 
04:33:59.029 --> 04:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so um these are
 
04:34:01.230 --> 04:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar multi-billion
 
04:34:05.070 --> 04:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
dollar corporations so is it fair to say
 
04:34:08.070 --> 04:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
that that if they and trash is trash
 
04:34:11.109 --> 04:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
it's there so if they pick up trash and
 
04:34:14.349 --> 04:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
they can't export it to New Hampshire
 
04:34:16.269 --> 04:34:16.279 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't cost them probably
 
04:34:17.990 --> 04:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
anything because they're going to find
 
04:34:20.750 --> 04:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
another place to export it to would that
 
04:34:22.990 --> 04:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
be a fair statement you know I don't
 
04:34:25.429 --> 04:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
want to comment on the profit margins
 
04:34:28.310 --> 04:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
and affordability of them to do that but
 
04:34:29.590 --> 04:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
but what was what came out of the
 
04:34:31.510 --> 04:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
committee is there are places that will
 
04:34:34.869 --> 04:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
take that gladly um um you know there
 
04:34:37.029 --> 04:34:37.039 align:start position:0%
are states there are you know in their
 
04:34:39.590 --> 04:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
ways to get that trash there so yeah
 
04:34:41.551 --> 04:34:41.561 align:start position:0%
there's there there are places for it
 
04:34:43.470 --> 04:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
that are not New Hampshire followup just
 
04:34:46.590 --> 04:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
one followup yeah and in with your uh
 
04:34:50.029 --> 04:34:50.039 align:start position:0%
the export numbers uh did those numbers
 
04:34:53.510 --> 04:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
include the recyclables that go down to
 
04:34:55.670 --> 04:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
the murf that cassella takes down to the
 
04:34:58.670 --> 04:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
murf in Bill R is that considered part
 
04:35:01.189 --> 04:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
of our export number or not that I don't
 
04:35:03.230 --> 04:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
know I don't know if that is or
 
04:35:07.349 --> 04:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
not representative kulon and then Bixby
 
04:35:08.629 --> 04:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thanks for
 
04:35:11.551 --> 04:35:11.561 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh representative one
 
04:35:13.629 --> 04:35:13.639 align:start position:0%
thing I'm curious about in this
 
04:35:16.109 --> 04:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
committee did you ever hear from the
 
04:35:18.750 --> 04:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts or where are they
 
04:35:21.869 --> 04:35:21.879 align:start position:0%
on this issue of trying to cut down on
 
04:35:21.879 --> 04:35:23.310 align:start position:0%
on this issue of trying to cut down on
Source

04:35:23.310 --> 04:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
Source
 
04:35:26.830 --> 04:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
reduction um thank you for the question
 
04:35:29.869 --> 04:35:29.879 align:start position:0%
uh we did not hear from the state of
 
04:35:32.830 --> 04:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um and and with all due
 
04:35:34.670 --> 04:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
respect I serve the people of New
 
04:35:37.429 --> 04:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not the Massachusetts so quite
 
04:35:39.629 --> 04:35:39.639 align:start position:0%
frankly I don't care what Massachusetts
 
04:35:41.949 --> 04:35:41.959 align:start position:0%
thinks about about uh what we do here
 
04:35:42.949 --> 04:35:42.959 align:start position:0%
under this
 
04:35:46.269 --> 04:35:46.279 align:start position:0%
Dome follow follow up I mean do you
 
04:35:49.310 --> 04:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
think we hear about the amount of trash
 
04:35:51.070 --> 04:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
coming from Massachusetts all the time
 
04:35:53.510 --> 04:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
do you think it would be a acceptable
 
04:35:57.109 --> 04:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
Act of diplomacy to not talk to anyone I
 
04:36:00.789 --> 04:36:00.799 align:start position:0%
mean it's not that far from
 
04:36:04.109 --> 04:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
us I mean I I
 
04:36:04.119 --> 04:36:05.750 align:start position:0%
us I mean I I
I

04:36:05.750 --> 04:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:36:07.750 --> 04:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
again I I I I I have a hard time
 
04:36:09.750 --> 04:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
empathizing with the with the state of
 
04:36:12.670 --> 04:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um you know they don't ask
 
04:36:17.269 --> 04:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
us uh about their taxes or their laws
 
04:36:19.629 --> 04:36:19.639 align:start position:0%
that they pass um you know I can freely
 
04:36:21.269 --> 04:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
carry a gun here in New Hampshire and I
 
04:36:22.789 --> 04:36:22.799 align:start position:0%
can't in Massachusetts they didn't ask
 
04:36:23.949 --> 04:36:23.959 align:start position:0%
our permission whether that was
 
04:36:26.070 --> 04:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate or not uh and I could get
 
04:36:28.470 --> 04:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
into other situations of that so quite
 
04:36:31.189 --> 04:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
frankly I again I don't I don't really
 
04:36:32.830 --> 04:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
care what Massachusetts thinks about
 
04:36:37.349 --> 04:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:41.230 --> 04:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby so um
 
04:36:44.310 --> 04:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
just uh to get for a little bit of
 
04:36:49.750 --> 04:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
clarity uh this bill is about capping uh
 
04:36:51.869 --> 04:36:51.879 align:start position:0%
waste outof State waste that goes into
 
04:36:54.990 --> 04:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
landfills correct correct yes so so if
 
04:36:58.709 --> 04:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
we had uh an industry here that uh
 
04:37:01.949 --> 04:37:01.959 align:start position:0%
developed to do Advanced recycling or to
 
04:37:05.670 --> 04:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
do other processing of uh of recyclable
 
04:37:07.949 --> 04:37:07.959 align:start position:0%
plastics or processing of recyclable
 
04:37:12.310 --> 04:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
paper or you know uh any sort of uh
 
04:37:15.349 --> 04:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
value added processing of waste then
 
04:37:18.230 --> 04:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
that would not count as to towards that
 
04:37:20.349 --> 04:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
15% that that's correct and going back
 
04:37:22.189 --> 04:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
to the report of the committee the
 
04:37:24.510 --> 04:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
committee was enthusiastic you know
 
04:37:26.670 --> 04:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
about exploring opportunities of of
 
04:37:28.949 --> 04:37:28.959 align:start position:0%
recycling and expanding our abilities to
 
04:37:31.830 --> 04:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
recycle uh amongst other things so so
 
04:37:34.789 --> 04:37:34.799 align:start position:0%
this is this would not be uh this would
 
04:37:37.830 --> 04:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
not not include the recycling again the
 
04:37:40.070 --> 04:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
the the the purview of the committee was
 
04:37:42.789 --> 04:37:42.799 align:start position:0%
to be um you know expanding our
 
04:37:44.310 --> 04:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
recycling abilities here in New
 
04:37:48.150 --> 04:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you pres NAB thank you
 
04:37:50.070 --> 04:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
madam chair um you mentioned earlier
 
04:37:52.070 --> 04:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
clarifying something in the Bill about
 
04:37:53.709 --> 04:37:53.719 align:start position:0%
the definition of out of state could you
 
04:37:55.750 --> 04:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
speak to that yeah and I think I don't
 
04:37:57.390 --> 04:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
have the amendment with me but if you if
 
04:38:00.789 --> 04:38:00.799 align:start position:0%
you look at the um uh line
 
04:38:00.799 --> 04:38:02.709 align:start position:0%
you look at the um uh line
four

04:38:02.709 --> 04:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:38:06.070 --> 04:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
um uh it's a short bill right line four
 
04:38:07.510 --> 04:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
it says paragraph shall not accept more
 
04:38:10.269 --> 04:38:10.279 align:start position:0%
than 15% of solid waste transported from
 
04:38:12.390 --> 04:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
out of state I think we're going to put
 
04:38:16.310 --> 04:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
something in there to the to to to to be
 
04:38:18.990 --> 04:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
uh essentially say generated from out of
 
04:38:20.789 --> 04:38:20.799 align:start position:0%
state you know so we don't want to make
 
04:38:24.470 --> 04:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
a loophole and uh and the idea was to
 
04:38:26.269 --> 04:38:26.279 align:start position:0%
you know we felt that it could be
 
04:38:29.750 --> 04:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
interpreted as a loophole and to uh to
 
04:38:33.349 --> 04:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
tighten that up a little bit Yeah
 
04:38:35.029 --> 04:38:35.039 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you thank
 
04:38:36.990 --> 04:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
Madam Shar and thanks uh for taking my
 
04:38:38.709 --> 04:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
question this is sort of a followup on
 
04:38:40.709 --> 04:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
representative nab's question it did
 
04:38:42.750 --> 04:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
occur to me
 
04:38:46.390 --> 04:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
um with the concept of of of waste
 
04:38:48.709 --> 04:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
generated out of
 
04:38:52.429 --> 04:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
state would in Internet Commerce or any
 
04:38:55.510 --> 04:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
type of thing that is sort of arriving
 
04:38:59.429 --> 04:38:59.439 align:start position:0%
not via sort of a New Hampshire entity
 
04:39:02.510 --> 04:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
play a part in this conversation in any
 
04:39:05.349 --> 04:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
way uh that was not
 
04:39:10.670 --> 04:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
considered in the committee but um if I
 
04:39:13.750 --> 04:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
may if you got a package from Amazon you
 
04:39:15.189 --> 04:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't consider that waste until you
 
04:39:18.189 --> 04:39:18.199 align:start position:0%
took the item out of it right so I think
 
04:39:20.349 --> 04:39:20.359 align:start position:0%
that probably you if that that's my own
 
04:39:22.949 --> 04:39:22.959 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that uh it's not waste
 
04:39:24.789 --> 04:39:24.799 align:start position:0%
until the value is out of it if you will
 
04:39:26.551 --> 04:39:26.561 align:start position:0%
or the product that it's carrying so I I
 
04:39:28.150 --> 04:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't consider that out of state
 
04:39:30.070 --> 04:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
waste you know a box that comes in that
 
04:39:31.789 --> 04:39:31.799 align:start position:0%
you know from the internet traffic and
 
04:39:33.709 --> 04:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
again that's my own opinion uh it wasn't
 
04:39:35.349 --> 04:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
addressed in the committee
 
04:39:38.830 --> 04:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
um but that would you know I you know
 
04:39:41.350 --> 04:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
the the that wasn't what the target was
 
04:39:43.830 --> 04:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:47.510 --> 04:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
will any other questions from the
 
04:39:51.788 --> 04:39:51.798 align:start position:0%
committee um I I do have a question
 
04:39:55.150 --> 04:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
so if we could limit the amount to say
 
04:39:59.788 --> 04:39:59.798 align:start position:0%
15% of so um Solid Waste could we also
 
04:40:02.350 --> 04:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
limit it to certain types of waste you
 
04:40:05.550 --> 04:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
know maybe not take demolition maybe not
 
04:40:08.350 --> 04:40:08.360 align:start position:0%
take mattresses maybe not certain things
 
04:40:11.948 --> 04:40:11.958 align:start position:0%
or is that does that tread on the
 
04:40:15.390 --> 04:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Commerce Clause yeah as I
 
04:40:17.670 --> 04:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
understand it balance of benefits yeah I
 
04:40:18.868 --> 04:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
mean that's as I understand I'll give
 
04:40:20.390 --> 04:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
this to you so you can read it as well
 
04:40:22.590 --> 04:40:22.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah but as I understand it if the if
 
04:40:24.110 --> 04:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
the burden of the balance of benefits
 
04:40:25.868 --> 04:40:25.878 align:start position:0%
can be and I'm not an attorney um you
 
04:40:27.190 --> 04:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
know if the burden of the balance of
 
04:40:29.910 --> 04:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
benefits can be shown then I think that
 
04:40:33.390 --> 04:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
the limitations can be can be imposed um
 
04:40:35.110 --> 04:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
I think that's the challenge that's the
 
04:40:36.750 --> 04:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
you know that's the bar is proving the
 
04:40:37.788 --> 04:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
balance of
 
04:40:40.788 --> 04:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
benefits okay thank you representative
 
04:40:43.750 --> 04:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
Duty thank you uh one last question do
 
04:40:47.310 --> 04:40:47.320 align:start position:0%
you see this as an either or between um
 
04:40:51.510 --> 04:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
HB 1145 or your bill or would you prefer
 
04:40:53.948 --> 04:40:53.958 align:start position:0%
to see both of them passed you know
 
04:40:55.430 --> 04:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's a good question somebody actually
 
04:40:57.110 --> 04:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
just posed that to me you know the other
 
04:41:00.470 --> 04:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
day if we have this do we need this and
 
04:41:04.948 --> 04:41:04.958 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that the end result
 
04:41:07.070 --> 04:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
is to limit I mean to limit out of state
 
04:41:09.470 --> 04:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
trash I mean you've heard it for the
 
04:41:12.390 --> 04:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
last two days New Hampshire has becoming
 
04:41:14.910 --> 04:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
uh if not is The Dumping Ground of New
 
04:41:17.310 --> 04:41:17.320 align:start position:0%
England and I think that's shocking and
 
04:41:20.310 --> 04:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
it's startling and uh the goal is to
 
04:41:22.788 --> 04:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
stop that you know I mean it it's the
 
04:41:24.628 --> 04:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
end of the day it's and it's not so much
 
04:41:26.670 --> 04:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
the trash it's what happens down the
 
04:41:28.390 --> 04:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
road with the trash you know the water
 
04:41:31.550 --> 04:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
the contaminants or whatever um so at
 
04:41:33.470 --> 04:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
the end of the day the the the the goal
 
04:41:36.350 --> 04:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
is to limit that that burden that
 
04:41:39.390 --> 04:41:39.400 align:start position:0%
external burden that we're we're seeing
 
04:41:40.990 --> 04:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
so I
 
04:41:43.788 --> 04:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
mean you know the committee came out
 
04:41:46.070 --> 04:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
with a number of
 
04:41:48.948 --> 04:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
options um you know the the committee's
 
04:41:51.150 --> 04:41:51.160 align:start position:0%
report wasn't either or it was these are
 
04:41:53.470 --> 04:41:53.480 align:start position:0%
the things that we feel based on our you
 
04:41:56.390 --> 04:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
know our our conditions could help this
 
04:41:58.948 --> 04:41:58.958 align:start position:0%
so I think going back to the report
 
04:42:00.628 --> 04:42:00.638 align:start position:0%
these were the findings of the committee
 
04:42:02.350 --> 04:42:02.360 align:start position:0%
it didn't say you have to do them all
 
04:42:04.830 --> 04:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
but we felt that any one of these would
 
04:42:08.350 --> 04:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
help in uh in in alleviating some of
 
04:42:10.350 --> 04:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
that okay some of that burden
 
04:42:12.830 --> 04:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative K thank you madam shair
 
04:42:14.230 --> 04:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for taking
 
04:42:14.240 --> 04:42:15.590 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for taking
my

04:42:15.590 --> 04:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:42:19.470 --> 04:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
question um in reading this bill any new
 
04:42:23.030 --> 04:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
landfill would be limited to 15% of out
 
04:42:27.110 --> 04:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
ofate waste in the previous Bill we were
 
04:42:29.030 --> 04:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
told we would be taking out of state
 
04:42:33.430 --> 04:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
waste but there was no limit I mean we
 
04:42:34.750 --> 04:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
could determine a limit but but there
 
04:42:38.270 --> 04:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
was no limit set so would you
 
04:42:41.110 --> 04:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
say determining between the two if it
 
04:42:43.550 --> 04:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
really is the goal of limiting out ofate
 
04:42:46.390 --> 04:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
waste that putting a number of 15% would
 
04:42:49.550 --> 04:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
actually do that I think a 15% would
 
04:42:52.110 --> 04:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
would do that I mean for any I mean I
 
04:42:53.550 --> 04:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
think that
 
04:42:56.550 --> 04:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
it yeah I think the net effect would be
 
04:42:58.910 --> 04:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
similar this is going to cap you a solid
 
04:42:59.990 --> 04:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
number a
 
04:43:02.750 --> 04:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
15% uh whereas the previous bill it
 
04:43:05.948 --> 04:43:05.958 align:start position:0%
would leave that further down the road
 
04:43:08.628 --> 04:43:08.638 align:start position:0%
for for of that discussion and that
 
04:43:11.230 --> 04:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
number May evolve I mean the state is
 
04:43:15.230 --> 04:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
tasked with reducing waste completely um
 
04:43:17.708 --> 04:43:17.718 align:start position:0%
and and that that number may be may be
 
04:43:20.590 --> 04:43:20.600 align:start position:0%
uh may be moving um you know the 15%
 
04:43:22.788 --> 04:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
really when you look at how much looking
 
04:43:25.910 --> 04:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
at the fairness of of you know with our
 
04:43:27.550 --> 04:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
what we're exporting versus what we're
 
04:43:30.990 --> 04:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
importing I think the 15% represents a
 
04:43:35.190 --> 04:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
fair a fair number um and I you know I
 
04:43:36.990 --> 04:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
feel confident about that like I said I
 
04:43:38.670 --> 04:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
started off thinking you know I need to
 
04:43:40.430 --> 04:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
get something to get this bill in but as
 
04:43:41.948 --> 04:43:41.958 align:start position:0%
I did the research I think we can
 
04:43:45.470 --> 04:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
validate that number right now followup
 
04:43:47.670 --> 04:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
and yeah thank you and your explanation
 
04:43:50.510 --> 04:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
was perfect um so thank you for that uh
 
04:43:53.230 --> 04:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
it was very understandable my other
 
04:43:54.910 --> 04:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
question is and I'm not sure if it was
 
04:43:57.270 --> 04:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
part of the purview of your committee
 
04:44:01.628 --> 04:44:01.638 align:start position:0%
but hazardous waste in itself um not
 
04:44:04.190 --> 04:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
sure if that is part of the numbers that
 
04:44:06.670 --> 04:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
you looked at because it is my
 
04:44:09.948 --> 04:44:09.958 align:start position:0%
understanding that New Hampshire exports
 
04:44:13.070 --> 04:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
all of its hazardous waste um and do you
 
04:44:16.510 --> 04:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
know what percentage of waste in general
 
04:44:17.510 --> 04:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
that that
 
04:44:20.948 --> 04:44:20.958 align:start position:0%
represents yeah I think the the the the
 
04:44:23.550 --> 04:44:23.560 align:start position:0%
the committee did recognize the fact
 
04:44:25.788 --> 04:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
that we do export waste there are some
 
04:44:29.590 --> 04:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
things that we export um the um all that
 
04:44:31.750 --> 04:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
I can tell you is the numbers that I
 
04:44:34.590 --> 04:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
that I I would assume that that hazard
 
04:44:36.910 --> 04:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
waste exported was included in the
 
04:44:39.390 --> 04:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
numbers you know the 5% 10% you know the
 
04:44:41.708 --> 04:44:41.718 align:start position:0%
14% with one standard deviation I
 
04:44:43.590 --> 04:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
believe that that was probably in I
 
04:44:45.430 --> 04:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
would have to but I don't know for sure
 
04:44:48.948 --> 04:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
um so you know if it's not then we we
 
04:44:51.110 --> 04:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
could accommodate for that uh with an
 
04:44:53.948 --> 04:44:53.958 align:start position:0%
amendment but um um I just looking at
 
04:44:56.230 --> 04:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
the comprehensive I think Dees does a
 
04:44:58.230 --> 04:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
pretty good job with these reports and
 
04:45:01.190 --> 04:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh um unless unless they want to talk to
 
04:45:03.510 --> 04:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
that I I would have to assume again I
 
04:45:05.350 --> 04:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
know that's dangerous sometimes but I
 
04:45:07.110 --> 04:45:07.120 align:start position:0%
have to assume that that's
 
04:45:10.510 --> 04:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
included represent ger thank you madam
 
04:45:13.750 --> 04:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
chair I was just thinking with as you
 
04:45:15.430 --> 04:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
were reiterating the point about the
 
04:45:18.350 --> 04:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
balance of benefits which is key to uh
 
04:45:20.110 --> 04:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
you know having this past constitutional
 
04:45:24.390 --> 04:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
muster the fact that we uh base our
 
04:45:27.750 --> 04:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
capacity projections only on instate
 
04:45:29.670 --> 04:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
production of waste right so that's not
 
04:45:31.070 --> 04:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
taking into account the waste that we're
 
04:45:33.030 --> 04:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
bringing into out of States isn't that
 
04:45:35.150 --> 04:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
also another another piece of this
 
04:45:37.270 --> 04:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
argument about the balance of benefits
 
04:45:39.350 --> 04:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
because their capacity is actually
 
04:45:41.948 --> 04:45:41.958 align:start position:0%
pegged to instate waste production yeah
 
04:45:44.430 --> 04:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
I think that yeah I mean that's uh you
 
04:45:47.350 --> 04:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
know when when you and gr I understand
 
04:45:49.110 --> 04:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
that the the goal of the state is to
 
04:45:52.310 --> 04:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of stuff in the um um
 
04:45:53.628 --> 04:45:53.638 align:start position:0%
you know that we're putting in the
 
04:45:54.948 --> 04:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
ground but I think you're right I would
 
04:45:58.310 --> 04:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
agree with you uh on that thank you any
 
04:45:59.830 --> 04:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
other questions from the
 
04:46:03.030 --> 04:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
04:46:05.868 --> 04:46:05.878 align:start position:0%
much represent roord
 
04:46:09.150 --> 04:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
I call Wayne Morrison to come and speak
 
04:46:11.868 --> 04:46:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:15.190 --> 04:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you very much if you want
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%

email

04:46:41.230 --> 04:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:44.030 --> 04:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
did you get a copy of this yeah we got
 
04:46:45.390 --> 04:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
that yes
 
04:46:49.190 --> 04:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay I got a couple of copies now
 
04:46:52.350 --> 04:46:52.360 align:start position:0%
yeah good afternoon good afternoon
 
04:46:53.590 --> 04:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
Madame chair thank you for the
 
04:46:57.030 --> 04:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh provide testimony um I
 
04:46:58.948 --> 04:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
would start by first I would like very
 
04:47:02.030 --> 04:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
much to thank U representative rokford
 
04:47:05.230 --> 04:47:05.240 align:start position:0%
representative ger and representative
 
04:47:09.270 --> 04:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
for taking on some very complicated um
 
04:47:11.670 --> 04:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
and and difficult to navigate uh
 
04:47:13.708 --> 04:47:13.718 align:start position:0%
conversations and to kind of delving
 
04:47:17.030 --> 04:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
into this problem it's uh it's overdue
 
04:47:19.510 --> 04:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's greatly needed and it's greatly
 
04:47:22.788 --> 04:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
appreciated um in the interest of time
 
04:47:26.430 --> 04:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to read through my my um
 
04:47:28.948 --> 04:47:28.958 align:start position:0%
testimony um and I I know you've heard
 
04:47:30.310 --> 04:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
quite a bit from me in the last couple
 
04:47:31.788 --> 04:47:31.798 align:start position:0%
of days and I promise this is the last
 
04:47:34.190 --> 04:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
time you'll have to hear from me today
 
04:47:35.990 --> 04:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
um I did want to I did want to highlight
 
04:47:39.788 --> 04:47:39.798 align:start position:0%
a couple of points um I think what we're
 
04:47:41.750 --> 04:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
talking about in terms of autate waste
 
04:47:43.788 --> 04:47:43.798 align:start position:0%
and I'll use rough numbers but they've
 
04:47:45.788 --> 04:47:45.798 align:start position:0%
been pretty consistent we're talking
 
04:47:48.830 --> 04:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
about a million tons of trash that comes
 
04:47:51.948 --> 04:47:51.958 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire pretty much every
 
04:47:55.548 --> 04:47:55.558 align:start position:0%
year which is an enormous amount it's
 
04:47:57.750 --> 04:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's it fluctuates from year to
 
04:47:58.990 --> 04:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
year but that's kind of the rate that
 
04:47:59.000 --> 04:48:00.030 align:start position:0%
year but that's kind of the rate that
we're

04:48:00.030 --> 04:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
we're
 
04:48:03.470 --> 04:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
at and to the question of profitability
 
04:48:05.190 --> 04:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
04:48:06.510 --> 04:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
uh companies choose to be in the
 
04:48:08.590 --> 04:48:08.600 align:start position:0%
businesses they're in I wish them all
 
04:48:11.470 --> 04:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
good luck um it's a complicated business
 
04:48:14.190 --> 04:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
we we want we want companies to prosper
 
04:48:17.150 --> 04:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
and we don't uh in any way wish to
 
04:48:19.110 --> 04:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
restrict their their making money at the
 
04:48:21.190 --> 04:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
business but the state of New Hampshire
 
04:48:22.548 --> 04:48:22.558 align:start position:0%
and the people of New Hampshire don't
 
04:48:24.350 --> 04:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
participate in that profit
 
04:48:27.788 --> 04:48:27.798 align:start position:0%
poll the out ofate companies that that
 
04:48:29.310 --> 04:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
send us their
 
04:48:32.628 --> 04:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
trash charge tipping fees they have
 
04:48:35.390 --> 04:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
transportation fees
 
04:48:38.590 --> 04:48:38.600 align:start position:0%
um and they Prof profit profit greatly
 
04:48:39.948 --> 04:48:39.958 align:start position:0%
from this
 
04:48:43.990 --> 04:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
business that model also it results in
 
04:48:46.830 --> 04:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
very large landfills being developed in
 
04:48:50.628 --> 04:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
the state and to the point about
 
04:48:52.548 --> 04:48:52.558 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount of trash that they
 
04:48:52.558 --> 04:48:53.470 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount of trash that they
would

04:48:53.470 --> 04:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:48:56.350 --> 04:48:56.360 align:start position:0%
process at the front end of that process
 
04:48:59.190 --> 04:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
what that would yield is landfills that
 
04:49:01.310 --> 04:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
are tailored for the amount for the
 
04:49:02.990 --> 04:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
volumes of trash that are generated in
 
04:49:04.670 --> 04:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
04:49:07.150 --> 04:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
with 15% or whatever else we would
 
04:49:08.910 --> 04:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
assume would be the number that we would
 
04:49:13.030 --> 04:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
allow um for out ofate waste in my mind
 
04:49:15.670 --> 04:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
that's a much better model than building
 
04:49:17.670 --> 04:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
an enormous
 
04:49:21.390 --> 04:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
landfill tailored for pulling in trash
 
04:49:22.750 --> 04:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
from all over New
 
04:49:25.390 --> 04:49:25.400 align:start position:0%
England so I think
 
04:49:30.990 --> 04:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
a state private company partnership is a
 
04:49:33.230 --> 04:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
very good model to think about we would
 
04:49:35.628 --> 04:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
have much stronger stronger voice in in
 
04:49:37.430 --> 04:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
the size of those
 
04:49:41.070 --> 04:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
landfills the other part of that is the
 
04:49:44.350 --> 04:49:44.360 align:start position:0%
carbon footprint of the current model if
 
04:49:48.470 --> 04:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
you think about trash coming into New
 
04:49:51.628 --> 04:49:51.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire most of our landfills of size
 
04:49:52.868 --> 04:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
the private
 
04:49:55.750 --> 04:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
ones are in the northern part of the
 
04:49:58.750 --> 04:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
state trash has hauled hundreds of miles
 
04:50:01.510 --> 04:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
up 93 I don't know if you notice the BMI
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
trucks going up
 
04:50:02.840 --> 04:50:04.548 align:start position:0%
trucks going up
93

04:50:04.548 --> 04:50:04.558 align:start position:0%
93
 
04:50:06.350 --> 04:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
they're coming from from Boston they're
 
04:50:08.350 --> 04:50:08.360 align:start position:0%
coming from far and and it wouldn't
 
04:50:10.510 --> 04:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
surprise me if if we would start seeing
 
04:50:12.350 --> 04:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
trucks from places like Conneticut
 
04:50:15.150 --> 04:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
because they've also changed their their
 
04:50:16.470 --> 04:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
laws and they're getting out of the
 
04:50:16.480 --> 04:50:17.590 align:start position:0%
laws and they're getting out of the
landfill

04:50:17.590 --> 04:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
04:50:21.030 --> 04:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
business trucks go all hundreds of miles
 
04:50:24.868 --> 04:50:24.878 align:start position:0%
they dump the trash turns into lee8 we
 
04:50:26.948 --> 04:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
tank our trucks go 100 miles back to
 
04:50:29.230 --> 04:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
conquered the lee8 gets processed
 
04:50:31.430 --> 04:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
through the waste facilities and into
 
04:50:35.070 --> 04:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
the meramac river it is not not in any
 
04:50:38.270 --> 04:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
way an efficient model in terms of the
 
04:50:40.590 --> 04:50:40.600 align:start position:0%
carbon footprint and the environmental
 
04:50:43.030 --> 04:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
impact of all of
 
04:50:45.470 --> 04:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
that the model that we have today and
 
04:50:48.270 --> 04:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
the reason that we need either to go to
 
04:50:51.670 --> 04:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
a u municipally owned landfill or to
 
04:50:53.788 --> 04:50:53.798 align:start position:0%
restrict uh to
 
04:50:57.150 --> 04:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
15% is that there is no absolutely no
 
04:50:59.350 --> 04:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
incentive for the private companies to
 
04:51:02.150 --> 04:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
change this model in fact it's it's
 
04:51:04.070 --> 04:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
they're incentivized to bring more and
 
04:51:06.628 --> 04:51:06.638 align:start position:0%
more and more in a ton of waste is a ton
 
04:51:08.708 --> 04:51:08.718 align:start position:0%
of waste is a ton of waste wherever it
 
04:51:11.628 --> 04:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
comes from and the Tipping
 
04:51:14.750 --> 04:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
fees it doesn't matter to them it it's
 
04:51:17.470 --> 04:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
all profit it does matter to the people
 
04:51:20.670 --> 04:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so I I think either one
 
04:51:22.990 --> 04:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
of these models or both of these models
 
04:51:26.070 --> 04:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
are imperative for us to get control of
 
04:51:28.230 --> 04:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
the waste that comes into the
 
04:51:28.240 --> 04:51:30.150 align:start position:0%
the waste that comes into the
state

04:51:30.150 --> 04:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:51:33.590 --> 04:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
um profitability and and the investment
 
04:51:36.708 --> 04:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
that we want I think um we want to
 
04:51:39.350 --> 04:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
reinforce a model that moves away from
 
04:51:41.948 --> 04:51:41.958 align:start position:0%
landfilling and I think the legislature
 
04:51:44.628 --> 04:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
over time should be moving
 
04:51:46.830 --> 04:51:46.840 align:start position:0%
towards freezing our
 
04:51:50.470 --> 04:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
landfall uh footprint and working on
 
04:51:52.708 --> 04:51:52.718 align:start position:0%
diversion where is the investment in
 
04:51:58.030 --> 04:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:00.470 --> 04:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
activities there are creative new
 
04:52:03.070 --> 04:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
business opportunities in those areas
 
04:52:05.390 --> 04:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
that will help the state of New
 
04:52:07.788 --> 04:52:07.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I think the fact that the
 
04:52:11.750 --> 04:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
committee includes Senator avard which
 
04:52:14.430 --> 04:52:14.440 align:start position:0%
not to be flippant but I I assume uh
 
04:52:16.030 --> 04:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
there was some interesting conversations
 
04:52:17.910 --> 04:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
it's terrific that Senator avart is on
 
04:52:22.070 --> 04:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
board with this um I think uh we have
 
04:52:24.110 --> 04:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
fought diligently over the years to try
 
04:52:26.510 --> 04:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
and address this issue and this is the
 
04:52:28.270 --> 04:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
most progress we've seen in terms of
 
04:52:29.510 --> 04:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
actually rolling up our sleeves and
 
04:52:31.470 --> 04:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
trying to do something this model
 
04:52:34.110 --> 04:52:34.120 align:start position:0%
already exists in other states it works
 
04:52:37.750 --> 04:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
Works um and now is the time to do it so
 
04:52:40.868 --> 04:52:40.878 align:start position:0%
I I would encourage us to to complete
 
04:52:43.670 --> 04:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
the work make amendments if we need to
 
04:52:45.430 --> 04:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
but a lot of the heavy lifting has been
 
04:52:47.310 --> 04:52:47.320 align:start position:0%
done this is this is the direction the
 
04:52:51.430 --> 04:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
state needs to go and the model is both
 
04:52:54.390 --> 04:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the state and it also will
 
04:52:56.708 --> 04:52:56.718 align:start position:0%
be beneficial to the private companies
 
04:52:59.788 --> 04:52:59.798 align:start position:0%
they will still have a thriving business
 
04:53:02.708 --> 04:53:02.718 align:start position:0%
model I think our our objective as a as
 
04:53:05.708 --> 04:53:05.718 align:start position:0%
a as C C and the legislators is we want
 
04:53:07.750 --> 04:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
to shift that model we want more
 
04:53:10.070 --> 04:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
investment in other areas we want to
 
04:53:12.110 --> 04:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
slow down landfilling and we want to
 
04:53:15.110 --> 04:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
increase diversion activities and this
 
04:53:18.110 --> 04:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
is a good start to doing that thank you
 
04:53:19.948 --> 04:53:19.958 align:start position:0%
when I take any questions thank you any
 
04:53:21.230 --> 04:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
04:53:23.510 --> 04:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
committee no thank you very much for
 
04:53:25.070 --> 04:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
your testimony this
 
04:53:28.430 --> 04:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon I'd like to invite Haley Jones
 
04:53:30.910 --> 04:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
to come and speak and you've asked for
 
04:53:30.920 --> 04:53:32.548 align:start position:0%
to come and speak and you've asked for
three

04:53:32.548 --> 04:53:32.558 align:start position:0%
three
 
04:53:32.558 --> 04:53:47.868 align:start position:0%
three
minutes

04:53:47.868 --> 04:53:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:50.190 --> 04:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
hi everybody you already know me um for
 
04:53:52.110 --> 04:53:52.120 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Haley Jones and
 
04:53:53.948 --> 04:53:53.958 align:start position:0%
I'm the Vermont and New Hampshire state
 
04:53:55.548 --> 04:53:55.558 align:start position:0%
director with slingshot where we work
 
04:53:58.310 --> 04:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
alongside communities most impacted by
 
04:54:00.190 --> 04:54:00.200 align:start position:0%
environmental threats to takeing at
 
04:54:03.270 --> 04:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
polluters and build community power and
 
04:54:05.788 --> 04:54:05.798 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify in support of House
 
04:54:08.788 --> 04:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
Bill 1632 uh which would prohibit newly
 
04:54:10.708 --> 04:54:10.718 align:start position:0%
permitted Solid Waste facilities from
 
04:54:13.548 --> 04:54:13.558 align:start position:0%
accepting more than 15% of solid waste
 
04:54:14.708 --> 04:54:14.718 align:start position:0%
from out of
 
04:54:17.150 --> 04:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
state it's no secret if you've been
 
04:54:19.070 --> 04:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
reading the news that New Hampshire has
 
04:54:21.548 --> 04:54:21.558 align:start position:0%
become a Dumping Ground for out ofate
 
04:54:24.230 --> 04:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
waste and as we've fallen behind in
 
04:54:26.390 --> 04:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
regulating our waste stream
 
04:54:28.470 --> 04:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and other states have
 
04:54:30.390 --> 04:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
started sending more trash and
 
04:54:32.430 --> 04:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
importantly construction and demolition
 
04:54:34.830 --> 04:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
debris to towards our less regulated
 
04:54:34.840 --> 04:54:35.868 align:start position:0%
debris to towards our less regulated
commercial

04:54:35.868 --> 04:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
04:54:38.990 --> 04:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
landfills in fact almost half of our
 
04:54:41.670 --> 04:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
trash is trucked in from other states
 
04:54:44.190 --> 04:54:44.200 align:start position:0%
with 900,000 tons dumped in commercial
 
04:54:46.350 --> 04:54:46.360 align:start position:0%
landfills in 2020
 
04:54:49.868 --> 04:54:49.878 align:start position:0%
alone so this influx of out ofate waste
 
04:54:53.110 --> 04:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
is bad in terms of landfill capacity yes
 
04:54:55.230 --> 04:54:55.240 align:start position:0%
um and many people have and will speak
 
04:54:57.150 --> 04:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
to this in their testimony but I'm
 
04:54:58.628 --> 04:54:58.638 align:start position:0%
actually here to speak about the
 
04:55:01.350 --> 04:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
environmental health impacts of this
 
04:55:04.510 --> 04:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
disproportionate waste flow when we see
 
04:55:06.310 --> 04:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
thousands of tons of additional waste
 
04:55:07.548 --> 04:55:07.558 align:start position:0%
pouring into New Hampshire from
 
04:55:09.390 --> 04:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
surrounding states we're seeing
 
04:55:12.270 --> 04:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
increased risk for water and air and
 
04:55:14.150 --> 04:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
noise pollution we're seeing increased
 
04:55:16.830 --> 04:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
risk for wear on te whoa wear and tear
 
04:55:18.590 --> 04:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
on our already vulnerable
 
04:55:21.548 --> 04:55:21.558 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and we're seeing heavier
 
04:55:23.628 --> 04:55:23.638 align:start position:0%
burdens on communities who are already
 
04:55:26.628 --> 04:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
living with the impacts of incinerators
 
04:55:29.910 --> 04:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
of super fund sites and of let's be real
 
04:55:29.920 --> 04:55:32.390 align:start position:0%
of super fund sites and of let's be real
mismanaged

04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
mismanaged
 
04:55:32.400 --> 04:55:33.990 align:start position:0%

landfilling

04:55:33.990 --> 04:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
landfilling
 
04:55:35.590 --> 04:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
we've seen time and time again
 
04:55:37.310 --> 04:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
especially in the cases of Bethlehem and
 
04:55:39.750 --> 04:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
Rochester that our existing landfills
 
04:55:41.990 --> 04:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
are providing little to no public
 
04:55:44.030 --> 04:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
benefit and pretty much anybody living
 
04:55:46.708 --> 04:55:46.718 align:start position:0%
near those landfills will tell you that
 
04:55:49.030 --> 04:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
yet for some reason big corporate waste
 
04:55:51.470 --> 04:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
hollers and their allies are continuing
 
04:55:53.990 --> 04:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
to push for expanded capacity and
 
04:55:55.430 --> 04:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
they're saying you know we've got so
 
04:55:57.548 --> 04:55:57.558 align:start position:0%
much waste coming into landfills we we
 
04:56:00.310 --> 04:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
have to we have to build more that's not
 
04:56:02.510 --> 04:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
getting at the root cause of our waste
 
04:56:05.070 --> 04:56:05.080 align:start position:0%
problem and it's a little too convenient
 
04:56:08.270 --> 04:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
in my opinion that in this pursuit of
 
04:56:11.310 --> 04:56:11.320 align:start position:0%
ever expanding profit margins big
 
04:56:13.990 --> 04:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
wasters are forgetting that half of our
 
04:56:17.270 --> 04:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
trash is coming in from other states so
 
04:56:19.310 --> 04:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
let's not sacrifice the health and
 
04:56:20.990 --> 04:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
well-being of our residents to line the
 
04:56:23.350 --> 04:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
pocketbooks of the waste industry and
 
04:56:25.590 --> 04:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
rather than allowing ourselves to
 
04:56:27.070 --> 04:56:27.080 align:start position:0%
continue being The Dumping Ground of New
 
04:56:29.390 --> 04:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
England let's take control over our own
 
04:56:32.628 --> 04:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
Futures by limiting out ofate waste
 
04:56:34.510 --> 04:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
giving our Reg Regulatory Agencies and
 
04:56:36.948 --> 04:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
our small towns time to think about true
 
04:56:39.190 --> 04:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
zero way Solutions like extended
 
04:56:41.548 --> 04:56:41.558 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility like reuse and
 
04:56:44.030 --> 04:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
repair systems and strengthen composting
 
04:56:45.750 --> 04:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and let's be clear I'm
 
04:56:47.470 --> 04:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
not talking about chemical recycling
 
04:56:49.510 --> 04:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
here I'm talking about zero Waste
 
04:56:52.350 --> 04:56:52.360 align:start position:0%
Solutions um so I'll just end by saying
 
04:56:54.230 --> 04:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
that as a young person who's going to
 
04:56:56.230 --> 04:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
live with the consequences of today's
 
04:56:58.430 --> 04:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
decisions I hope that you will all vote
 
04:57:01.070 --> 04:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
a to pass on 1632 and make it the
 
04:57:02.750 --> 04:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
strongest that it can be thank you so
 
04:57:06.110 --> 04:57:06.120 align:start position:0%
much for your time and I'm happy to take
 
04:57:09.590 --> 04:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
questions any questions no thank you

04:57:38.470 --> 04:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
management division at Dees and I still
 
04:57:40.750 --> 04:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
have with me Leah McKenna the

management
 
04:57:46.990 --> 04:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
Bureau at Dees thank you for the
 
04:57:50.390 --> 04:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify on House Bill
 
04:57:53.510 --> 04:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
1632 Dees is not taking a position on
 
04:57:55.868 --> 04:57:55.878 align:start position:0%
this bill but has concerns that we'd
 
04:57:59.190 --> 04:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
like to relay about how um the
 
04:58:00.910 --> 04:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
requirement that it would put in place
 
04:58:03.350 --> 04:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
may be subject to Legal challenges
 
04:58:05.310 --> 04:58:05.320 align:start position:0%
additionally we have some uncertainty
 
04:58:07.510 --> 04:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
about the potential impact of the bill
 
04:58:08.590 --> 04:58:08.600 align:start position:0%
on the amount that New Hampshire
 
04:58:10.350 --> 04:58:10.360 align:start position:0%
communities and businesses would pay for
 
04:58:11.910 --> 04:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
solid waste
 
04:58:14.670 --> 04:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
disposal we understand that while
 
04:58:16.708 --> 04:58:16.718 align:start position:0%
existing facilities would not be subject
 
04:58:19.030 --> 04:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
to the limitation in this bill newly
 
04:58:20.910 --> 04:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
permitted Solid Waste facilities would
 
04:58:24.070 --> 04:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
be limited to accepting no more than 15%
 
04:58:25.990 --> 04:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
solid waste from out of
 
04:58:28.310 --> 04:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
state uh the Commerce Clause of the US
 
04:58:30.110 --> 04:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution which has been mentioned
 
04:58:32.350 --> 04:58:32.360 align:start position:0%
already this afternoon is commonly
 
04:58:34.390 --> 04:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
interpreted to to prevent a state from
 
04:58:36.590 --> 04:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
prohibiting or restricting commercial
 
04:58:39.030 --> 04:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste facilities from accepting
 
04:58:41.270 --> 04:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
and disposing of out ofate
 
04:58:43.990 --> 04:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
waste if enacted we're concerned that
 
04:58:45.470 --> 04:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
the provisions of this bill would
 
04:58:49.868 --> 04:58:49.878 align:start position:0%
subject de would sub excuse
 
04:58:54.070 --> 04:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
me if enacted we're concerned that
 
04:58:56.868 --> 04:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
the provisions of this bill would
 
04:58:59.990 --> 04:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
subject Dees decisions on permits which
 
04:59:02.110 --> 04:59:02.120 align:start position:0%
would incorporate the requirement in the
 
04:59:04.110 --> 04:59:04.120 align:start position:0%
bill to Legal challenges based on the
 
04:59:04.120 --> 04:59:05.910 align:start position:0%
bill to Legal challenges based on the
Commerce

04:59:05.910 --> 04:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
Commerce
 
04:59:08.270 --> 04:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
Clause regarding the impact on Solid
 
04:59:10.190 --> 04:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
Waste Disposal costs we're not sure what
 
04:59:12.510 --> 04:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
those would be it would be possible that
 
04:59:14.590 --> 04:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
disposal costs would decrease because
 
04:59:16.310 --> 04:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
more landfill capacity would be
 
04:59:18.470 --> 04:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
available for local Solid
 
04:59:20.990 --> 04:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
Waste it's also possible that by
 
04:59:23.948 --> 04:59:23.958 align:start position:0%
limiting the universe of a of waste that
 
04:59:26.868 --> 04:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
a facility could receive the facility's
 
04:59:30.190 --> 04:59:30.200 align:start position:0%
ability to operate at fully permitted
 
04:59:32.390 --> 04:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
capacity would be limited so the
 
04:59:34.070 --> 04:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
operation cost costs would increase
 
04:59:37.270 --> 04:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
which would also increase waste disposal
 
04:59:41.430 --> 04:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
costs I also wanted to clarify um some
 
04:59:43.548 --> 04:59:43.558 align:start position:0%
information earlier when representative
 
04:59:46.110 --> 04:59:46.120 align:start position:0%
Bixby questioned whether the bill only
 
04:59:48.628 --> 04:59:48.638 align:start position:0%
caps the amount of outof State Solid
 
04:59:51.150 --> 04:59:51.160 align:start position:0%
Waste going to landfills or whether it
 
04:59:54.190 --> 04:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
would uh include solid waste going to
 
04:59:57.510 --> 04:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
recycling and other types of facilities
 
05:00:00.548 --> 05:00:00.558 align:start position:0%
when I read the bill line three says any
 
05:00:03.150 --> 05:00:03.160 align:start position:0%
solid waste facility Solid Waste
 
05:00:05.190 --> 05:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
facility includes waste to energy
 
05:00:07.548 --> 05:00:07.558 align:start position:0%
facility transfer station recycling
 
05:00:10.190 --> 05:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
facility so any of those types of
 
05:00:12.708 --> 05:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
facilities that receive a permit um on
 
05:00:14.510 --> 05:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
or after the effective date would have
 
05:00:18.670 --> 05:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:21.628 --> 05:00:21.638 align:start position:0%
accept those are the concerns that we
 
05:00:24.270 --> 05:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
hoped to bring before you and I would be
 
05:00:26.230 --> 05:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions that you
 
05:00:28.390 --> 05:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
have questions from the
 
05:00:30.788 --> 05:00:30.798 align:start position:0%
committee representative H Haskins thank
 
05:00:32.510 --> 05:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you for taking my
 
05:00:36.310 --> 05:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
question do you know when this um
 
05:00:40.708 --> 05:00:40.718 align:start position:0%
particular paper was drafted by the
 
05:00:42.628 --> 05:00:42.638 align:start position:0%
commissioner from here I can't see what
 
05:00:44.110 --> 05:00:44.120 align:start position:0%
you have I'm assuming the one that you
 
05:00:46.310 --> 05:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
just passed out the one dated February
 
05:00:49.350 --> 05:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
14th was written yesterday and signed
 
05:00:50.788 --> 05:00:50.798 align:start position:0%
today by the commissioner and it was
 
05:00:52.830 --> 05:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
reviewed by our director Mike wisat and
 
05:00:55.270 --> 05:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
approved by him okay follow up if I may
 
05:00:57.868 --> 05:00:57.878 align:start position:0%
follow and I assume they have read the
 
05:01:01.470 --> 05:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
report of the solid waste working
 
05:01:04.190 --> 05:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
group it was the committee it was the
 
05:01:06.350 --> 05:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
study committee study committee that I
 
05:01:08.030 --> 05:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
don't know I have not seen a copy of it
 
05:01:10.788 --> 05:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
myself I'm sure we could make one
 
05:01:15.590 --> 05:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:19.708 --> 05:01:19.718 align:start position:0%
you yes because in the in this
 
05:01:24.190 --> 05:01:24.200 align:start position:0%
report in this report they do um mention
 
05:01:27.430 --> 05:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
um The Memo from Department of Justice
 
05:01:29.270 --> 05:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
regarding the Commerce Clause thank you
 
05:01:31.390 --> 05:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
we'll look forward to reading it
 
05:01:34.590 --> 05:01:34.600 align:start position:0%
sure represent M
 
05:01:37.830 --> 05:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
Duty uh thank you madam chair I must
 
05:01:39.788 --> 05:01:39.798 align:start position:0%
admit I'm a little confused because we
 
05:01:40.910 --> 05:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
just heard
 
05:01:44.670 --> 05:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
testimony that uh it was director whimet
 
05:01:47.548 --> 05:01:47.558 align:start position:0%
who met with the committee and pointed
 
05:01:51.830 --> 05:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
out that there were definitely ways to
 
05:01:54.708 --> 05:01:54.718 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements of the Commerce
 
05:01:57.990 --> 05:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
Clause two particularly right off the
 
05:02:00.150 --> 05:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
bat and one that they might have to
 
05:02:04.430 --> 05:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
massage a little bit so I'm confused
 
05:02:08.910 --> 05:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
that um director whimet would directly
 
05:02:12.470 --> 05:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
you know contradict that in this letter
 
05:02:14.868 --> 05:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
um and I'm a little confused why we've
 
05:02:17.948 --> 05:02:17.958 align:start position:0%
seen you know a lot of letters signed by
 
05:02:21.830 --> 05:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott but in the five years
 
05:02:24.110 --> 05:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
that I've been here I couldn't tell you
 
05:02:26.510 --> 05:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
what commissioner Scott looks like so is
 
05:02:29.868 --> 05:02:29.878 align:start position:0%
there any reason why the letter writer
 
05:02:33.470 --> 05:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh has not chosen has chosen not not to
 
05:02:38.270 --> 05:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
come and um defend his comments to the
 
05:02:41.948 --> 05:02:41.958 align:start position:0%
committee de's letters are written by
 
05:02:43.948 --> 05:02:43.958 align:start position:0%
the agency as a whole and all of our
 
05:02:46.150 --> 05:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
letters of testimony are signed by the
 
05:02:48.830 --> 05:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner I too was perplexed by the
 
05:02:51.910 --> 05:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier uh given that Mike
 
05:02:56.150 --> 05:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:00.548 --> 05:03:00.558 align:start position:0%
letter okay any other questions from the
 
05:03:03.310 --> 05:03:03.320 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none
 
05:03:05.830 --> 05:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your testimony
 
05:03:05.840 --> 05:03:08.510 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your testimony
appreciate

05:03:08.510 --> 05:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:12.788 --> 05:03:12.798 align:start position:0%
it okay uh is there anyone else in the
 
05:03:15.350 --> 05:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
audience there who would like to speak
 
05:03:20.788 --> 05:03:20.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:28.150 --> 05:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:32.350 --> 05:03:32.360 align:start position:0%
sheet online we have 311 people in
 
05:03:32.360 --> 05:03:34.350 align:start position:0%
sheet online we have 311 people in
support

05:03:34.350 --> 05:03:34.360 align:start position:0%
support
 
05:03:38.670 --> 05:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
report and zero in
 
05:03:41.670 --> 05:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
opposition and then on the blue sheet
 
05:03:46.548 --> 05:03:46.558 align:start position:0%
here we have six persons signed in favor
 
05:03:49.868 --> 05:03:49.878 align:start position:0%
of this bill and with that I'm going to
 
05:03:56.430 --> 05:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:56.440 --> 05:04:00.350 align:start position:0%
 
1632

05:04:00.350 --> 05:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:03.750 --> 05:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to to let the
 
05:04:06.190 --> 05:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
committee know we had scheduled for
 
05:04:09.830 --> 05:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
today work session that begins at
 
05:04:13.510 --> 05:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
3:30 and we have um finished our
 
05:04:16.110 --> 05:04:16.120 align:start position:0%
hearings um
 
05:04:20.990 --> 05:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
early so uh I had uh sent a um a message
 
05:04:24.270 --> 05:04:24.280 align:start position:0%
to the clerk of the house uh regarding
 
05:04:25.910 --> 05:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
asking him if we could start our work
 
05:04:28.510 --> 05:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
session earlier and unfortunately we
 
05:04:31.830 --> 05:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
cannot because when you notice something
 
05:04:36.628 --> 05:04:36.638 align:start position:0%
you can not start earlier than what we
 
05:04:38.590 --> 05:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
um notice
 
05:04:41.948 --> 05:04:41.958 align:start position:0%
so we'll have to stay those who wish to
 
05:04:45.910 --> 05:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
stay on uh to um engage in the full
 
05:04:49.030 --> 05:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
committee work session you're welcome to
 
05:04:52.110 --> 05:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
if you have some other pressing issues
 
05:04:55.868 --> 05:04:55.878 align:start position:0%
and need to leave uh I would understand
 
05:04:59.070 --> 05:04:59.080 align:start position:0%
but uh I'm going to uh end our hearings
 
05:05:00.310 --> 05:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
for this
 
05:05:04.030 --> 05:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
afternoon and um we we can reconvene at
 
05:05:06.990 --> 05:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
3:30 representative Howard thank you
 
05:05:09.708 --> 05:05:09.718 align:start position:0%
madam chair um do we have a list of
 
05:05:13.350 --> 05:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
bills that will be work on yes the bills
 
05:05:17.190 --> 05:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
that we uh were going to discuss were
 
05:05:21.350 --> 05:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:26.590 --> 05:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:30.350 --> 05:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
that yep and let's
 
05:05:35.350 --> 05:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
see yes we heard the bills um HB 1687 HB
 
05:05:40.030 --> 05:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
1132 HB 1170 and hb1 1620 were the bills
 
05:05:42.390 --> 05:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
that we heard yesterday so we were going
 
05:05:44.030 --> 05:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
to discuss them this
 
05:05:47.750 --> 05:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon sure representative Duty can I
 
05:05:49.670 --> 05:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
just make a comment about a term that we
 
05:05:52.510 --> 05:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
continue to use and that is the term
 
05:05:56.548 --> 05:05:56.558 align:start position:0%
Advanced recycling it really is Advanced
 
05:05:58.948 --> 05:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
incineration there's nothing to
 
05:06:01.110 --> 05:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
recycling means you know I mean
 
05:06:03.868 --> 05:06:03.878 align:start position:0%
basically that you take a can an
 
05:06:06.190 --> 05:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
aluminum can and you recycle it and you
 
05:06:08.788 --> 05:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
get another aluminum can um this is
 
05:06:12.948 --> 05:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
really waste to energy so I
 
05:06:17.590 --> 05:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
mean it is not Advanced recycling Peter
 
05:06:20.030 --> 05:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
tell me if if there's what's recycled
 
05:06:20.788 --> 05:06:20.798 align:start position:0%
what do
 
05:06:25.190 --> 05:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
you so uh as as we defined in our in the
 
05:06:29.030 --> 05:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
bill we passed last term uh Advanced
 
05:06:31.430 --> 05:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
recycling main the chemical products
 
05:06:33.430 --> 05:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
from Advanced recycling may not be used
 
05:06:38.070 --> 05:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
for fuel thank you you can keep this and
 
05:06:41.030 --> 05:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh what happens with the products of
 
05:06:43.628 --> 05:06:43.638 align:start position:0%
advanced re of the chemical recycling is
 
05:06:45.270 --> 05:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
which is probably a better term for it
 
05:06:50.070 --> 05:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
is that they are are uh essentially
 
05:06:52.150 --> 05:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
you're you're getting something that is
 
05:06:55.470 --> 05:06:55.480 align:start position:0%
similar to oil from the chem from the
 
05:06:58.788 --> 05:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
chemical recycling process those uh
 
05:07:01.990 --> 05:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
chemicals are used to make new Plastics
 
05:07:04.910 --> 05:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
and uh can also be used to make waxes
 
05:07:05.990 --> 05:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
and other
 
05:07:11.510 --> 05:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
lubricants uh so uh the so it is in fact
 
05:07:15.670 --> 05:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
recycling there is a uh there is it's
 
05:07:18.350 --> 05:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
not 100% because there is loss there is
 
05:07:20.110 --> 05:07:20.120 align:start position:0%
loss in mechanical recycling as well
 
05:07:21.590 --> 05:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
even for things that are fairly
 
05:07:24.470 --> 05:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
efficient like paper uh
 
05:07:27.150 --> 05:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
so uh I think the loss rates may be
 
05:07:30.470 --> 05:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
higher with chemical recycling but uh
 
05:07:34.230 --> 05:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
the current rate of of uh of recycling
 
05:07:37.708 --> 05:07:37.718 align:start position:0%
is I believe somewhere in the 80 to 90%
 
05:07:39.350 --> 05:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
range for chemical
 
05:07:42.708 --> 05:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
recycling so it is in fact recycling it
 
05:07:45.708 --> 05:07:45.718 align:start position:0%
is it is not without its problems but it
 
05:07:49.590 --> 05:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:54.390 --> 05:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
incineration okay so um let's take a
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:01.200 --> 05:31:41.430 align:start position:0%
 
3:30

05:31:41.430 --> 05:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:44.070 --> 05:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
all right dear committee
 
05:31:48.070 --> 05:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
members we are back and we are gonna
 
05:31:51.030 --> 05:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
discuss four bills this
 
05:31:53.628 --> 05:31:53.638 align:start position:0%
afternoon just want to get an idea where
 
05:31:56.628 --> 05:31:56.638 align:start position:0%
everybody's what everybody's thinking on
 
05:31:56.638 --> 05:31:58.590 align:start position:0%
everybody's what everybody's thinking on
these

05:31:58.590 --> 05:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:32:00.868 --> 05:32:00.878 align:start position:0%
um we have
 
05:32:00.878 --> 05:32:03.070 align:start position:0%
um we have
HB

05:32:03.070 --> 05:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
HB
 
05:32:05.390 --> 05:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
1687 relative to disposal of
 
05:32:07.110 --> 05:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition debris from
 
05:32:09.270 --> 05:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
State construction
 
05:32:13.628 --> 05:32:13.638 align:start position:0%
projects and um I know we had testimony
 
05:32:17.510 --> 05:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
on this and I believe uh representative
 
05:32:19.948 --> 05:32:19.958 align:start position:0%
Murray is working on an amendment for
 
05:32:23.390 --> 05:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
this bill would you like to explain what
 
05:32:25.910 --> 05:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
you're working on thank you madam chair
 
05:32:28.510 --> 05:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
yes um so in testimony we heard
 
05:32:30.788 --> 05:32:30.798 align:start position:0%
yesterday about the fact that this is
 
05:32:33.150 --> 05:32:33.160 align:start position:0%
really limited to State contracts and
 
05:32:35.030 --> 05:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's really all that it is looking to
 
05:32:36.788 --> 05:32:36.798 align:start position:0%
clarify language around contracts that
 
05:32:41.310 --> 05:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
the state holds uh and in that I really
 
05:32:44.470 --> 05:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
the main and primary um concern that uh
 
05:32:46.830 --> 05:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
folks had was making sure that
 
05:32:49.868 --> 05:32:49.878 align:start position:0%
um waste hazardous waste and hazardous
 
05:32:51.990 --> 05:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
materials were equally defined as their
 
05:32:54.948 --> 05:32:54.958 align:start position:0%
own separate definitions because they
 
05:32:58.470 --> 05:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
are in fact different so that is really
 
05:33:00.350 --> 05:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
what we're looking to clarify and that's
 
05:33:04.150 --> 05:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
the extent of I think what was necessary
 
05:33:06.510 --> 05:33:06.520 align:start position:0%
um but I'm open to hearing other
 
05:33:09.350 --> 05:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
thoughts so um line seven of the
 
05:33:09.360 --> 05:33:10.590 align:start position:0%
thoughts so um line seven of the
proposed

05:33:10.590 --> 05:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
05:33:14.310 --> 05:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
bill um where it says all hazardous
 
05:33:18.628 --> 05:33:18.638 align:start position:0%
material so you are intending on putting
 
05:33:22.150 --> 05:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
all hazardous material as defined by RSA
 
05:33:22.160 --> 05:33:23.750 align:start position:0%
all hazardous material as defined by RSA
147

05:33:23.750 --> 05:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
147
 
05:33:28.990 --> 05:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
B2 be U Roman numeral 7 I think and
 
05:33:29.000 --> 05:33:30.670 align:start position:0%
B2 be U Roman numeral 7 I think and
hazardous

05:33:30.670 --> 05:33:30.680 align:start position:0%
hazardous
 
05:33:35.070 --> 05:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
waste as defined by RSA 147 B2 Roman
 
05:33:38.590 --> 05:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
numeral 8 and so that that makes that
 
05:33:41.390 --> 05:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
definition there that's correct okay
 
05:33:43.868 --> 05:33:43.878 align:start position:0%
repres and then oh sorry go ahead and
 
05:33:45.390 --> 05:33:45.400 align:start position:0%
then I think we were discussing about
 
05:33:48.110 --> 05:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
whether or not it applied to University
 
05:33:50.430 --> 05:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
Systems and it was in testimony that it
 
05:33:53.910 --> 05:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
did yeah because it is included in the
 
05:33:57.070 --> 05:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
statute um in in the entire statute
 
05:34:00.510 --> 05:34:00.520 align:start position:0%
there representative NAB and
 
05:34:02.110 --> 05:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
then we'll go over there thank you I
 
05:34:04.990 --> 05:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
just oh God sorry um do you need my
 
05:34:08.788 --> 05:34:08.798 align:start position:0%
microphone yeah no you're fine um I just
 
05:34:10.270 --> 05:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
uh the representative from Dees
 
05:34:11.510 --> 05:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday made a comment about how
 
05:34:13.548 --> 05:34:13.558 align:start position:0%
Asbestos and pcbs were separately
 
05:34:15.070 --> 05:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
governed and so I just wanted to make
 
05:34:16.750 --> 05:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
sure that they were covered in the
 
05:34:18.470 --> 05:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
statutes around hazardous materials and
 
05:34:20.190 --> 05:34:20.200 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste and didn't need to be
 
05:34:21.868 --> 05:34:21.878 align:start position:0%
separately called
 
05:34:24.670 --> 05:34:24.680 align:start position:0%
out could you just so should could that
 
05:34:25.868 --> 05:34:25.878 align:start position:0%
just be clarified when you do the
 
05:34:27.270 --> 05:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
amendment make sure they're includ they
 
05:34:29.548 --> 05:34:29.558 align:start position:0%
are already included as far as my notes
 
05:34:31.430 --> 05:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
say that they
 
05:34:35.350 --> 05:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
um Mr piset from
 
05:34:39.708 --> 05:34:39.718 align:start position:0%
Dees mentioned that we already do this
 
05:34:43.310 --> 05:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:46.030 --> 05:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
done Madam chair yeah it was my
 
05:34:47.390 --> 05:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
understanding that they have their own
 
05:34:49.590 --> 05:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
separate categories and how they they're
 
05:34:51.590 --> 05:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
managed and if I heard that incorrectly
 
05:34:52.910 --> 05:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
then I think there are two folks from
 
05:34:55.350 --> 05:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
the department but um unless I've heard
 
05:34:55.360 --> 05:34:58.788 align:start position:0%
the department but um unless I've heard
otherwise

05:34:58.788 --> 05:34:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:58.798 --> 05:35:00.350 align:start position:0%
 
incorrectly

05:35:00.350 --> 05:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
incorrectly
 
05:35:03.830 --> 05:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
yeah sure represent Contour thank you um
 
05:35:05.948 --> 05:35:05.958 align:start position:0%
from a construction standpoint even in
 
05:35:08.868 --> 05:35:08.878 align:start position:0%
the private sector you must separate out
 
05:35:12.708 --> 05:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
asbest um because it is clearly defined
 
05:35:16.070 --> 05:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
and how it is disposed of that's right
 
05:35:19.548 --> 05:35:19.558 align:start position:0%
okay and and the fact
 
05:35:24.430 --> 05:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
is they're saying that these separations
 
05:35:28.750 --> 05:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
for these State projects for all intents
 
05:35:31.270 --> 05:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
intents and purposes are already done
 
05:35:31.280 --> 05:35:32.548 align:start position:0%
intents and purposes are already done
but

05:35:32.548 --> 05:35:32.558 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:35:37.750 --> 05:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
that by specifying this with this bill
 
05:35:41.190 --> 05:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
it would improve compliance
 
05:35:45.548 --> 05:35:45.558 align:start position:0%
and um that's kind of what I got from it
 
05:35:47.910 --> 05:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
too thank you madam chair I think that
 
05:35:49.948 --> 05:35:49.958 align:start position:0%
yes that's what I had inferred that they
 
05:35:52.548 --> 05:35:52.558 align:start position:0%
were um just eager to tighten that up
 
05:35:54.750 --> 05:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
and just for clarity sake that yes that
 
05:35:57.830 --> 05:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
it was already done but just okay
 
05:35:59.990 --> 05:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative Howard um quick question
 
05:36:02.670 --> 05:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
did did we um determine that uh road
 
05:36:06.070 --> 05:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
construction was included in this Bill
 
05:36:08.830 --> 05:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
yes yes I think they
 
05:36:11.910 --> 05:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
said okay you let me let me just take a
 
05:36:14.470 --> 05:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
peek at
 
05:36:14.480 --> 05:36:17.788 align:start position:0%
peek at
RSA

05:36:17.788 --> 05:36:17.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:17.798 --> 05:36:22.110 align:start position:0%
 
whoops

05:36:22.110 --> 05:36:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:24.948 --> 05:36:24.958 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm looking at
 
05:36:27.548 --> 05:36:27.558 align:start position:0%
RSA 149
 
05:36:31.430 --> 05:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
M go right ahead uh so um one of the
 
05:36:33.310 --> 05:36:33.320 align:start position:0%
things that I I think that's important
 
05:36:36.788 --> 05:36:36.798 align:start position:0%
to note is that they they said that uh
 
05:36:39.830 --> 05:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
all of the that this the separation for
 
05:36:42.750 --> 05:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
State projects is and and for private
 
05:36:44.990 --> 05:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
Pro projects is already required in
 
05:36:48.470 --> 05:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
rules but there's no particular
 
05:36:51.548 --> 05:36:51.558 align:start position:0%
oversight of that and that having it
 
05:36:55.750 --> 05:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
listed in the contract would uh help um
 
05:36:58.590 --> 05:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
strengthen compliance
 
05:36:58.600 --> 05:37:00.910 align:start position:0%
strengthen compliance
right

05:37:00.910 --> 05:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:37:06.430 --> 05:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
okay so considering um the
 
05:37:08.190 --> 05:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
clarifications that representative
 
05:37:10.548 --> 05:37:10.558 align:start position:0%
Murray is bringing in an
 
05:37:12.948 --> 05:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
amendment it would seem to me that the
 
05:37:15.910 --> 05:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
committee would be okay with doing an
 
05:37:20.150 --> 05:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
otpa on this bill at some point yeah
 
05:37:24.868 --> 05:37:24.878 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm good yeah I'm good
 
05:37:28.150 --> 05:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
okay uh discussion anybody else have any
 
05:37:30.830 --> 05:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
discussion about hb6
 
05:37:35.310 --> 05:37:35.320 align:start position:0%
1687 okay HB 1132 relative to permits
 
05:37:37.430 --> 05:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
for the sighting of new
 
05:37:40.030 --> 05:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
landfills so let me
 
05:37:45.670 --> 05:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:49.750 --> 05:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
tab and this had to do with the
 
05:37:52.910 --> 05:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
brownfields and um anybody have any
 
05:37:55.070 --> 05:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
comments about that particular Bill
 
05:37:57.708 --> 05:37:57.718 align:start position:0%
representative kulon uh yeah I want to
 
05:38:00.670 --> 05:38:00.680 align:start position:0%
say that I I like this
 
05:38:03.830 --> 05:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
and um I think it could benefit
 
05:38:06.830 --> 05:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
from uh maybe like an interim study to
 
05:38:09.510 --> 05:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
kind of broaden it to alleviate some of
 
05:38:12.948 --> 05:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
the problems with Dees I think it's
 
05:38:16.030 --> 05:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
smart to consider these Brown field
 
05:38:18.868 --> 05:38:18.878 align:start position:0%
sites for different Waste Management
 
05:38:24.390 --> 05:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
solar or Advanced recycling uh
 
05:38:26.628 --> 05:38:26.638 align:start position:0%
facility representative Duty did you
 
05:38:28.510 --> 05:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
just kick
 
05:38:28.520 --> 05:38:34.030 align:start position:0%
just kick
him

05:38:34.030 --> 05:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:36.310 --> 05:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh I had sent out an email to the
 
05:38:38.670 --> 05:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
committee also uh with some information
 
05:38:40.390 --> 05:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
that the es has on their website
 
05:38:42.750 --> 05:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
regarding Brown fields and then they
 
05:38:46.070 --> 05:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
have a database that's searchable of all
 
05:38:48.390 --> 05:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
the brown fields in New Hampshire there
 
05:38:51.590 --> 05:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
are over 300 of them
 
05:38:54.510 --> 05:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
um yeah so I just wanted to let you know
 
05:38:56.948 --> 05:38:56.958 align:start position:0%
that represent Bixby and then kraton and
 
05:39:00.230 --> 05:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
then ktoa yeah I I think that um there
 
05:39:02.510 --> 05:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
may be potential uses for
 
05:39:06.030 --> 05:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
brownfields that uh would be um
 
05:39:09.110 --> 05:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate but I don't think that uh
 
05:39:12.430 --> 05:39:12.440 align:start position:0%
that landfills are uh that uh that
 
05:39:14.868 --> 05:39:14.878 align:start position:0%
there's a high enough chance of getting
 
05:39:17.230 --> 05:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
a landf a brown field that is going to
 
05:39:20.190 --> 05:39:20.200 align:start position:0%
work for a landfill that it needs that
 
05:39:22.350 --> 05:39:22.360 align:start position:0%
it should be put into law that we that
 
05:39:25.030 --> 05:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
that should be looked at I think that uh
 
05:39:27.350 --> 05:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's an issue with a
 
05:39:29.230 --> 05:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
lot of the brownfields is that they many
 
05:39:32.110 --> 05:39:32.120 align:start position:0%
of of them are cited along rivers which
 
05:39:34.270 --> 05:39:34.280 align:start position:0%
basically knocks them out from
 
05:39:36.708 --> 05:39:36.718 align:start position:0%
consideration for so for
 
05:39:43.510 --> 05:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
landfills uh and uh the so I think that
 
05:39:47.070 --> 05:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
um we we may want cons to consider other
 
05:39:49.190 --> 05:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
legislation that would encourage the use
 
05:39:52.990 --> 05:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
of brownfields for other productive uh
 
05:39:57.830 --> 05:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
uses like you know solar uh solar Farms
 
05:40:01.230 --> 05:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
or um you know something that is also
 
05:40:03.990 --> 05:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
that is compatible with it not being a
 
05:40:08.990 --> 05:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
pure site but uh I think that it I think
 
05:40:11.150 --> 05:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
that it's enough of a non-starter for
 
05:40:13.868 --> 05:40:13.878 align:start position:0%
landfills that we should itl this bill
 
05:40:16.110 --> 05:40:16.120 align:start position:0%
and if we want to do if people want to
 
05:40:19.070 --> 05:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
do something else with brownfields then
 
05:40:21.788 --> 05:40:21.798 align:start position:0%
propose other legislation for it and I
 
05:40:23.670 --> 05:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
would be happy to co-sponsor something
 
05:40:26.990 --> 05:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
with you on that representative speak I
 
05:40:28.750 --> 05:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
I don't want to I don't want to do the
 
05:40:30.190 --> 05:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that I want to sign up for
 
05:40:32.230 --> 05:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
figuring out what that something is but
 
05:40:34.030 --> 05:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
but I would be willing to support it
 
05:40:37.628 --> 05:40:37.638 align:start position:0%
okay as would I um represent
 
05:40:40.230 --> 05:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
comto thank you madam chair and this is
 
05:40:43.948 --> 05:40:43.958 align:start position:0%
not about the bill it is about the site
 
05:40:46.430 --> 05:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of abbreviations uh
 
05:40:48.230 --> 05:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
when we were looking at the brown Fields
 
05:40:53.070 --> 05:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
whether it was um uh like lust and um
 
05:40:55.110 --> 05:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
you know asbest and things like that and
 
05:40:56.430 --> 05:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering if you could give
 
05:41:00.110 --> 05:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
us a kind of like a list to tell us what
 
05:41:03.788 --> 05:41:03.798 align:start position:0%
those different um abbreviations meant
 
05:41:05.830 --> 05:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
so that we understand it and the other
 
05:41:09.310 --> 05:41:09.320 align:start position:0%
question I had was some of them said
 
05:41:12.350 --> 05:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
closed some of them some terminated and
 
05:41:14.190 --> 05:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know what the qualifications
 
05:41:17.910 --> 05:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
of what that means if if you don't
 
05:41:23.070 --> 05:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
mind may I yeah can she sure yeah
 
05:41:25.350 --> 05:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely and thank you for staying and
 
05:41:28.190 --> 05:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
being here no problem we appreciate it I
 
05:41:29.468 --> 05:41:29.478 align:start position:0%
think I didn't quite hear hear
 
05:41:30.670 --> 05:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
everything you said some of them said
 
05:41:32.390 --> 05:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
closed and some of them said what
 
05:41:34.230 --> 05:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
terminated and some of them are still
 
05:41:36.070 --> 05:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
open I believe that's what I saw on the
 
05:41:37.910 --> 05:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
website so when I was looking at the
 
05:41:39.350 --> 05:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
Brownfield sites you know you had a lot
 
05:41:39.360 --> 05:41:40.110 align:start position:0%
Brownfield sites you know you had a lot
of

05:41:40.110 --> 05:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:41:42.510 --> 05:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
abbreviations and we didn't understand
 
05:41:43.628 --> 05:41:43.638 align:start position:0%
when we were looking at them this
 
05:41:45.788 --> 05:41:45.798 align:start position:0%
morning kind of what some of them meant
 
05:41:48.110 --> 05:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
you know what those abbreviations were
 
05:41:50.430 --> 05:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
sure and how do you determine if
 
05:41:54.350 --> 05:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
something is closed um or is it opened
 
05:41:56.830 --> 05:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
is or completed right so closed and
 
05:42:00.030 --> 05:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
completed are two different things um
 
05:42:02.350 --> 05:42:02.360 align:start position:0%
does completed mean they met all the
 
05:42:05.270 --> 05:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
remediation requirements clo I mean so
 
05:42:07.230 --> 05:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
we just trying to get some guidance on
 
05:42:09.750 --> 05:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
the terminology on that site so that we
 
05:42:11.868 --> 05:42:11.878 align:start position:0%
could understand it better and interpret
 
05:42:14.110 --> 05:42:14.120 align:start position:0%
the data
 
05:42:17.150 --> 05:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
better y but I asked representative
 
05:42:22.468 --> 05:42:22.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:25.150 --> 05:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
didn't he he's sitting here looking very
 
05:42:28.150 --> 05:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
dejected on Valentine's Day
 
05:42:31.110 --> 05:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
crushed no I
 
05:42:33.788 --> 05:42:33.798 align:start position:0%
so in fact I had a unique thought but it
 
05:42:35.590 --> 05:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
was super Saed by everyone else first of
 
05:42:38.350 --> 05:42:38.360 align:start position:0%
all I agree with representative kulon
 
05:42:40.948 --> 05:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
that the Brownfield site should be
 
05:42:45.468 --> 05:42:45.478 align:start position:0%
used but uh Dees very eloquently said
 
05:42:46.708 --> 05:42:46.718 align:start position:0%
yesterday a
 
05:42:51.070 --> 05:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
handful to a few to nothing and so the
 
05:42:53.430 --> 05:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
idea that as representative Bixby said
 
05:42:55.430 --> 05:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
that we would then tell a company to
 
05:42:56.868 --> 05:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
look at something that we know is not
 
05:43:00.150 --> 05:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
going to amount to anything then I don't
 
05:43:02.230 --> 05:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
know why we would do that but if there
 
05:43:03.390 --> 05:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
is something we could do with those
 
05:43:06.270 --> 05:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
brown s Brownfield sites then I'm all in
 
05:43:09.030 --> 05:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Murray yes thank you
 
05:43:13.590 --> 05:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
now sorry um so I I think more to my
 
05:43:16.230 --> 05:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
point too I did I agree I I'd like to
 
05:43:19.190 --> 05:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
learn a little bit more I did look at um
 
05:43:20.948 --> 05:43:20.958 align:start position:0%
what I interpreted to be on the
 
05:43:23.390 --> 05:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
brownfields website to be a list of
 
05:43:25.310 --> 05:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
maybe five or six that seem to have
 
05:43:27.468 --> 05:43:27.478 align:start position:0%
completed their full brownfields
 
05:43:30.510 --> 05:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
remediation um and but it was not a list
 
05:43:33.590 --> 05:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
of many and the the acreage was small um
 
05:43:35.948 --> 05:43:35.958 align:start position:0%
but then there were others that to
 
05:43:38.670 --> 05:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
representative comos Point had under
 
05:43:41.910 --> 05:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
project types they were listed as um
 
05:43:46.190 --> 05:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
cercla versus um like a spill which I
 
05:43:48.070 --> 05:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
imagine is a hazardous spill of some
 
05:43:49.708 --> 05:43:49.718 align:start position:0%
site but so we're looking for clarity
 
05:43:49.718 --> 05:43:51.708 align:start position:0%
site but so we're looking for clarity
there

05:43:51.708 --> 05:43:51.718 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:43:55.750 --> 05:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
um yes and so and how often those get
 
05:43:57.868 --> 05:43:57.878 align:start position:0%
updated was also something that I was
 
05:43:59.310 --> 05:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
curious about because some of the dates
 
05:44:01.190 --> 05:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
went back to like there was a note that
 
05:44:08.990 --> 05:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:11.708 --> 05:44:11.718 align:start position:0%
Revisited um I'm challenged because I'm
 
05:44:13.070 --> 05:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
not looking at exactly what you're
 
05:44:14.670 --> 05:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
looking at and when I look at this
 
05:44:16.948 --> 05:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
information it's in our database what
 
05:44:18.510 --> 05:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
what you see online pulls from our
 
05:44:20.310 --> 05:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
database and that's why you're seeing
 
05:44:23.270 --> 05:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
those acronyms uh because our fields in
 
05:44:25.548 --> 05:44:25.558 align:start position:0%
our database are short so lust is a
 
05:44:28.510 --> 05:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
funny acronym that means leaking
 
05:44:30.390 --> 05:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
Underground storage tank so that's a
 
05:44:32.670 --> 05:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
site that at some point in time had an
 
05:44:34.230 --> 05:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
underground tank for petroleum that
 
05:44:36.150 --> 05:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
leaked it just stuck out it's
 
05:44:40.868 --> 05:44:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:46.590 --> 05:44:46.600 align:start position:0%
than is is representative
 
05:44:49.548 --> 05:44:49.558 align:start position:0%
Duty would it be possible to use this
 
05:44:52.430 --> 05:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
bill for interim study and basically
 
05:44:54.350 --> 05:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
instead of just taking out the land
 
05:44:56.788 --> 05:44:56.798 align:start position:0%
fields and just studying Brown Fields
 
05:45:00.510 --> 05:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me like we or
 
05:45:02.190 --> 05:45:02.200 align:start position:0%
somebody and I don't think we can push
 
05:45:03.670 --> 05:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
this off on
 
05:45:06.990 --> 05:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
Dees we need more information on the
 
05:45:08.750 --> 05:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
brownfields that are out there so we
 
05:45:11.510 --> 05:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
might be able to make a recommendation
 
05:45:14.230 --> 05:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
or talk about it for legislation so
 
05:45:16.270 --> 05:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
would that be possible well instead of
 
05:45:18.510 --> 05:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
an interim study I I would actually like
 
05:45:20.190 --> 05:45:20.200 align:start position:0%
to have Dees come in and do a
 
05:45:22.430 --> 05:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
presentation about brownfields in New
 
05:45:27.270 --> 05:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um the programs that they
 
05:45:29.830 --> 05:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
have for um um
 
05:45:34.350 --> 05:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
brownfields what how they are perhaps
 
05:45:37.110 --> 05:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
promoting to the public the use of
 
05:45:40.590 --> 05:45:40.600 align:start position:0%
brownfields are there programs that help
 
05:45:46.270 --> 05:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
fund um re reuse or repurposing of those
 
05:45:48.510 --> 05:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
properties um I think that would be a
 
05:45:51.190 --> 05:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
really interesting presentation to have
 
05:45:53.150 --> 05:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
for the
 
05:45:56.990 --> 05:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
committee representative Duty yeah um as
 
05:45:59.708 --> 05:45:59.718 align:start position:0%
an addition to that as it turn turns out
 
05:46:02.830 --> 05:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
I I think it's probably a brown field in
 
05:46:05.708 --> 05:46:05.718 align:start position:0%
New in Nashville which is very small my
 
05:46:08.548 --> 05:46:08.558 align:start position:0%
neighbor happens to own it and uh and
 
05:46:10.628 --> 05:46:10.638 align:start position:0%
it's been capped so Dees has been
 
05:46:12.548 --> 05:46:12.558 align:start position:0%
involved in it and it's it's been capped
 
05:46:15.190 --> 05:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
and it's right along the the salmon and
 
05:46:17.190 --> 05:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that we have is that
 
05:46:19.430 --> 05:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
he would like to donate it to the city
 
05:46:21.868 --> 05:46:21.878 align:start position:0%
but the city doesn't want to take on
 
05:46:25.510 --> 05:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
quote that liability for a capped uh
 
05:46:29.270 --> 05:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
Brownfield so if we could have I I need
 
05:46:32.110 --> 05:46:32.120 align:start position:0%
to get more information about that to
 
05:46:35.190 --> 05:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
try to elay the city's concerns because
 
05:46:37.548 --> 05:46:37.558 align:start position:0%
we would like to keep that area open you
 
05:46:40.270 --> 05:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
know for the Waterway but so if you
 
05:46:42.548 --> 05:46:42.558 align:start position:0%
could include that something like that
 
05:46:44.390 --> 05:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh the longevity what are the chances of
 
05:46:46.590 --> 05:46:46.600 align:start position:0%
them leaking how do you monitor that
 
05:46:48.548 --> 05:46:48.558 align:start position:0%
that would really be helpful to
 
05:46:52.030 --> 05:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
me yes and the property that you speak
 
05:46:54.270 --> 05:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
about might be a candidate for a
 
05:46:57.390 --> 05:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
brownfields covenant that sometimes can
 
05:46:59.510 --> 05:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
elay the concerns of an entity that's
 
05:47:01.390 --> 05:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
acquiring the property it would have to
 
05:47:03.868 --> 05:47:03.878 align:start position:0%
be eligible and there are criteria but
 
05:47:05.390 --> 05:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
um we have a
 
05:47:08.590 --> 05:47:08.600 align:start position:0%
new uh new supervisor of our brownfields
 
05:47:10.190 --> 05:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
program she's an engineer who's been
 
05:47:11.548 --> 05:47:11.558 align:start position:0%
with the program for many years and
 
05:47:13.750 --> 05:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
she's very Dynamic and I would love to
 
05:47:15.468 --> 05:47:15.478 align:start position:0%
have her come and talk with you okay
 
05:47:17.750 --> 05:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
we'll have to set a date and time for
 
05:47:19.990 --> 05:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
that I would I would really appreciate
 
05:47:23.310 --> 05:47:23.320 align:start position:0%
that because uh it's an important issue
 
05:47:27.310 --> 05:47:27.320 align:start position:0%
of how we can repurpose these um sites
 
05:47:30.990 --> 05:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
for something useful in our communities
 
05:47:34.310 --> 05:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative Howard just um when that
 
05:47:36.190 --> 05:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
presentation comes is is there any sort
 
05:47:38.070 --> 05:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
of documentation that you already have
 
05:47:41.670 --> 05:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
of of you know like that tells that
 
05:47:43.910 --> 05:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
would tell us about the individual the
 
05:47:46.230 --> 05:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
thing whatever research you have on it
 
05:47:48.150 --> 05:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
on the different Brown fields that would
 
05:47:49.750 --> 05:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
that you could compile and bring to us
 
05:47:52.150 --> 05:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
so that if we were to advance a bill we
 
05:47:53.270 --> 05:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
would we could talk about the different
 
05:47:56.070 --> 05:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:58.868 --> 05:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
landfills I'll see what we have I I
 
05:48:00.510 --> 05:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
don't think we would have anything
 
05:48:03.270 --> 05:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
comprehensive um that summarizes every
 
05:48:06.310 --> 05:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
site we may have documents that have
 
05:48:09.310 --> 05:48:09.320 align:start position:0%
success stories about Key
 
05:48:11.868 --> 05:48:11.878 align:start position:0%
Properties yeah representative comto
 
05:48:14.190 --> 05:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and representative
 
05:48:18.150 --> 05:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
um Howard on their site you can see all
 
05:48:21.990 --> 05:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
the brown Fields um and and you can send
 
05:48:23.510 --> 05:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
the link out to you in an email and you
 
05:48:26.350 --> 05:48:26.360 align:start position:0%
can sort them by town if you'd
 
05:48:32.150 --> 05:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:34.750 --> 05:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
on some of them it
 
05:48:37.548 --> 05:48:37.558 align:start position:0%
does representative Haskins thank you
 
05:48:39.548 --> 05:48:39.558 align:start position:0%
can we hang on to the bill until we hear
 
05:48:39.558 --> 05:48:41.270 align:start position:0%
can we hang on to the bill until we hear
this

05:48:41.270 --> 05:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:48:44.830 --> 05:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
presentation uh not I don't think so
 
05:48:47.070 --> 05:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
okay because
 
05:48:49.468 --> 05:48:49.478 align:start position:0%
um yeah we I don't think we'll have time
 
05:48:51.708 --> 05:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
for any presentations until probably
 
05:48:54.708 --> 05:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
after March okay and we really need to
 
05:48:56.708 --> 05:48:56.718 align:start position:0%
get these bills
 
05:48:59.910 --> 05:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
out so representative
 
05:49:02.868 --> 05:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
kulon oh yeah just to clarify my initial
 
05:49:06.190 --> 05:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
point I meant to uh study it to
 
05:49:08.868 --> 05:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
completely remove the landfill part
 
05:49:10.788 --> 05:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
because I just think I think it's
 
05:49:15.670 --> 05:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable to have people um you know to
 
05:49:18.350 --> 05:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
suggest a first option for say a solar
 
05:49:21.230 --> 05:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
site like if there's a part on a river
 
05:49:24.350 --> 05:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
that's south facing that's a perfect
 
05:49:27.548 --> 05:49:27.558 align:start position:0%
place for a solar array to go as opposed
 
05:49:30.350 --> 05:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
to a green field so whatever we do is
 
05:49:32.110 --> 05:49:32.120 align:start position:0%
fine I'm just saying I think it's I
 
05:49:34.390 --> 05:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
think it's a good
 
05:49:37.548 --> 05:49:37.558 align:start position:0%
idea well I think I I don't know that we
 
05:49:41.510 --> 05:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
could amend this bill to do that in the
 
05:49:44.390 --> 05:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
time frame that we're looking at um but
 
05:49:48.750 --> 05:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
I again I I would invite a a new bill to
 
05:49:51.430 --> 05:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
be put in next year which I would be
 
05:49:52.910 --> 05:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
happy to help
 
05:49:57.030 --> 05:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
with uh yeah represent Bixby yeah so I
 
05:50:01.510 --> 05:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
think that um just in terms of uh
 
05:50:03.110 --> 05:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
figuring out what do we want to do with
 
05:50:04.590 --> 05:50:04.600 align:start position:0%
this bill rather than what we want to do
 
05:50:07.788 --> 05:50:07.798 align:start position:0%
with brownfields um it looks like there
 
05:50:09.670 --> 05:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
are two options one would be to do an
 
05:50:13.350 --> 05:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
interim study one would be to do an itl
 
05:50:16.190 --> 05:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
and if we itl we still have the option
 
05:50:19.030 --> 05:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
of doing an ad hoc uh study of
 
05:50:20.750 --> 05:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
brownfields and committee and I would I
 
05:50:22.788 --> 05:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
would prefer that latter option I would
 
05:50:26.548 --> 05:50:26.558 align:start position:0%
as well representative um ger and then
 
05:50:30.190 --> 05:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you very much uh uh so I I
 
05:50:32.110 --> 05:50:32.120 align:start position:0%
I would like and perhaps an ad hoc
 
05:50:33.750 --> 05:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
committee is is the way to do this for
 
05:50:36.390 --> 05:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
us to have the opportunity to hear from
 
05:50:38.030 --> 05:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
some more from Dees that would be great
 
05:50:40.070 --> 05:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
but also I remembered and I was just
 
05:50:43.310 --> 05:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
looking it up that last year in Keen uh
 
05:50:46.110 --> 05:50:46.120 align:start position:0%
you we got a million-dollar Grant uh
 
05:50:48.070 --> 05:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
Through The madok Economic Development
 
05:50:49.948 --> 05:50:49.958 align:start position:0%
Corporation for the development of a
 
05:50:52.310 --> 05:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
couple of Brownfield sites in Keane that
 
05:50:55.110 --> 05:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
was disappointed that one near kind of
 
05:50:57.030 --> 05:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
near I I live unfortunately didn't end
 
05:50:58.110 --> 05:50:58.120 align:start position:0%
up on the list because I think it would
 
05:51:01.150 --> 05:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
be ultimately for some housing but um so
 
05:51:02.788 --> 05:51:02.798 align:start position:0%
I I think there are some other groups in
 
05:51:05.110 --> 05:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
the state for example The madok Economic
 
05:51:06.628 --> 05:51:06.638 align:start position:0%
Development Corporation there must be
 
05:51:09.350 --> 05:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
others who are actively involved in this
 
05:51:13.350 --> 05:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
case in using Federal money to uh work
 
05:51:14.708 --> 05:51:14.718 align:start position:0%
on some of her Brownfield site so I
 
05:51:15.910 --> 05:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's through the ad hoc
 
05:51:18.270 --> 05:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
committee or some other kind of
 
05:51:19.548 --> 05:51:19.558 align:start position:0%
instrument but I think it would be
 
05:51:21.868 --> 05:51:21.878 align:start position:0%
helpful to hear from some of these
 
05:51:23.788 --> 05:51:23.798 align:start position:0%
groups in the state that are actively
 
05:51:25.350 --> 05:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
right now engaged in helping to
 
05:51:28.948 --> 05:51:28.958 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate Brownfield sites okay
 
05:51:30.910 --> 05:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
representative Howard I have sort of a
 
05:51:32.788 --> 05:51:32.798 align:start position:0%
technical question I I support the itl
 
05:51:35.830 --> 05:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
so this is this may be moot but um if we
 
05:51:38.310 --> 05:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
were to put something like a landfill on
 
05:51:41.190 --> 05:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
top of a Brownfield site wouldn't we be
 
05:51:42.830 --> 05:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
worried about pushing the pollution
 
05:51:47.190 --> 05:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
that's in there down into into that was
 
05:51:50.350 --> 05:51:50.360 align:start position:0%
that was um excuse me so a question that
 
05:51:53.510 --> 05:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
had come up during the hearing um
 
05:51:55.510 --> 05:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
whereby somebody was I think it was
 
05:51:56.910 --> 05:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
representative gerana who might have
 
05:51:58.910 --> 05:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
brought that up who said that if we're
 
05:52:00.830 --> 05:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
putting a landfill on top of a brown
 
05:52:03.750 --> 05:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
field aren't we sort of making the
 
05:52:07.190 --> 05:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
toxicity even worse first of all and
 
05:52:10.230 --> 05:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
would we then also have difficulties in
 
05:52:11.948 --> 05:52:11.958 align:start position:0%
monitoring it going forward because you
 
05:52:14.830 --> 05:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
don't know whatever stuff is coming out
 
05:52:17.628 --> 05:52:17.638 align:start position:0%
in lee8 or whatever else if it's from
 
05:52:19.510 --> 05:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
the original Brownfield or from the
 
05:52:22.868 --> 05:52:22.878 align:start position:0%
landfill that you put there so it
 
05:52:25.548 --> 05:52:25.558 align:start position:0%
complicates matters representative Bixby
 
05:52:27.628 --> 05:52:27.638 align:start position:0%
yeah so we actually have kind of an
 
05:52:31.628 --> 05:52:31.638 align:start position:0%
example of this uh because the uh
 
05:52:34.270 --> 05:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
current landfill in Bethlehem was put on
 
05:52:38.150 --> 05:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
a previous landfill site and the
 
05:52:40.510 --> 05:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
condition of doing that of them doing
 
05:52:43.190 --> 05:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
that landfill was to remove a certain
 
05:52:47.070 --> 05:52:47.080 align:start position:0%
amount of the of the contaminated soil
 
05:52:49.788 --> 05:52:49.798 align:start position:0%
that was uh sort of underneath where
 
05:52:51.670 --> 05:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
they were going to be putting the liner
 
05:52:53.990 --> 05:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
and then put that into the the newly
 
05:52:57.070 --> 05:52:57.080 align:start position:0%
lined landfill and that got rid of some
 
05:52:59.868 --> 05:52:59.878 align:start position:0%
of it but in fact what it it also buried
 
05:53:02.230 --> 05:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
a bunch of other you know more of it
 
05:53:05.030 --> 05:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
which is now leeching out
 
05:53:10.830 --> 05:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
into uh the towards the amusic uh and
 
05:53:12.868 --> 05:53:12.878 align:start position:0%
depending on who's testing you look at
 
05:53:14.708 --> 05:53:14.718 align:start position:0%
it's either you know going in at higher
 
05:53:16.270 --> 05:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
levels or lower levels but there's
 
05:53:20.310 --> 05:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
definitely pasas that is coming and
 
05:53:23.628 --> 05:53:23.638 align:start position:0%
um I forget what the other one is maybe
 
05:53:26.788 --> 05:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
dioxine that's that is leeching from
 
05:53:29.548 --> 05:53:29.558 align:start position:0%
underneath the landfill in in
 
05:53:32.990 --> 05:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem uh and because it was
 
05:53:34.830 --> 05:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
essentially a Brownfield site that got
 
05:53:37.190 --> 05:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
then put under a landfill so yes that is
 
05:53:39.628 --> 05:53:39.638 align:start position:0%
in fact a real
 
05:53:43.190 --> 05:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
problem any other discussion about HB
 
05:53:47.230 --> 05:53:47.240 align:start position:0%
1132 looks like we're probably um
 
05:53:50.190 --> 05:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
looking at it Ling that bill and um and
 
05:53:54.190 --> 05:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
working on on some kind of legislation
 
05:53:58.150 --> 05:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
to encourage uh use of of brownfields
 
05:54:01.868 --> 05:54:01.878 align:start position:0%
for other purposes representative Penza
 
05:54:03.750 --> 05:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
I know I'm coming in at the end and I
 
05:54:06.190 --> 05:54:06.200 align:start position:0%
had briefly spoken with representative
 
05:54:08.468 --> 05:54:08.478 align:start position:0%
kulon about this so that time frame
 
05:54:11.750 --> 05:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow for us to make any
 
05:54:15.110 --> 05:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
modifications to that for other uses we
 
05:54:16.830 --> 05:54:16.840 align:start position:0%
just don't have I mean if you want to
 
05:54:19.350 --> 05:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
take a stab at it I I certainly would
 
05:54:22.990 --> 05:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
welcome it but I think I think this in
 
05:54:26.430 --> 05:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
this really deserves us looking at it
 
05:54:28.548 --> 05:54:28.558 align:start position:0%
more closely and if we have an ad hoc
 
05:54:30.590 --> 05:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
Committee just like we're going to do
 
05:54:33.350 --> 05:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
with studying food um you know the food
 
05:54:37.030 --> 05:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
issues uh food safety issues um I think
 
05:54:39.830 --> 05:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
I think we would come out with a better
 
05:54:42.590 --> 05:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
Bill product in the end some kind
 
05:54:46.948 --> 05:54:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:51.270 --> 05:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
year okay all right thank you so much
 
05:54:55.110 --> 05:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
yep all right let's move on to HB 11170
 
05:54:57.150 --> 05:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
requiring public benefit on community
 
05:54:59.230 --> 05:54:59.240 align:start position:0%
impact assessment from the Department of
 
05:54:59.240 --> 05:55:00.868 align:start position:0%
impact assessment from the Department of
Environmental

05:55:00.868 --> 05:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
Environmental
 
05:55:03.670 --> 05:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
Services do I have anyone who has a
 
05:55:06.430 --> 05:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
comment on that representative Murray uh
 
05:55:07.670 --> 05:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I did have a
 
05:55:09.910 --> 05:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
parliamentary question I just wanted to
 
05:55:12.910 --> 05:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
make sure um there are two potential
 
05:55:15.190 --> 05:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
amendments and in the process of
 
05:55:17.190 --> 05:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
thinking about them if we were to move
 
05:55:21.310 --> 05:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
one before the other um I correct me if
 
05:55:25.030 --> 05:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong Peter does one supersede the
 
05:55:29.708 --> 05:55:29.718 align:start position:0%
other if we do something with if if we
 
05:55:31.670 --> 05:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
if we work with these amendments we need
 
05:55:34.110 --> 05:55:34.120 align:start position:0%
to rewrite both of them so that they are
 
05:55:35.868 --> 05:55:35.878 align:start position:0%
into one Amendment because the committee
 
05:55:43.990 --> 05:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:47.030 --> 05:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
correct represent ger um I'm trying to
 
05:55:50.548 --> 05:55:50.558 align:start position:0%
remember um Dees understandably only got
 
05:55:52.350 --> 05:55:52.360 align:start position:0%
the Amendments uh yeser why everybody
 
05:55:53.910 --> 05:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
did but was only able to first look at
 
05:55:55.510 --> 05:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
them yesterday and my recollection is
 
05:55:57.510 --> 05:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
that they said they wouldn't be able yet
 
05:56:00.030 --> 05:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
to to provide as much feedback on the
 
05:56:02.430 --> 05:56:02.440 align:start position:0%
content of those amendments so I I
 
05:56:03.788 --> 05:56:03.798 align:start position:0%
actually thought we weren't going to do
 
05:56:05.230 --> 05:56:05.240 align:start position:0%
that today for that reason but so I was
 
05:56:07.548 --> 05:56:07.558 align:start position:0%
just surprised well we could no we could
 
05:56:09.708 --> 05:56:09.718 align:start position:0%
still just have our own conversation
 
05:56:12.190 --> 05:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
about you know our thoughts on it okay
 
05:56:16.270 --> 05:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
and um I mean um let me just take a look
 
05:56:16.280 --> 05:56:17.868 align:start position:0%
and um I mean um let me just take a look
here

05:56:17.868 --> 05:56:17.878 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:56:20.590 --> 05:56:20.600 align:start position:0%
just the the purpose of this work
 
05:56:22.590 --> 05:56:22.600 align:start position:0%
session is not to figure out the the
 
05:56:24.430 --> 05:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
complete solution this is just to figure
 
05:56:26.590 --> 05:56:26.600 align:start position:0%
out the general feeling of the committee
 
05:56:28.310 --> 05:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of this is is this something we
 
05:56:30.628 --> 05:56:30.638 align:start position:0%
want to move on with is this something
 
05:56:34.070 --> 05:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
we want to just it uh do we need to do
 
05:56:35.510 --> 05:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
amendments and then we can figure out
 
05:56:38.070 --> 05:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
who's doing the
 
05:56:43.830 --> 05:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
Amendments well personally um I think
 
05:56:46.150 --> 05:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:56:48.990 --> 05:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
expressing public benefit what public
 
05:56:49.000 --> 05:56:50.628 align:start position:0%
expressing public benefit what public
benefit

05:56:50.628 --> 05:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
05:56:55.910 --> 05:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
means um is something that is preferable
 
05:56:58.310 --> 05:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
is something that we need to do we need
 
05:57:01.030 --> 05:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
to have that discussion and I think it
 
05:57:04.110 --> 05:57:04.120 align:start position:0%
needs to be spelled out because um
 
05:57:06.830 --> 05:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise it just seems to be this vague
 
05:57:06.840 --> 05:57:07.868 align:start position:0%
otherwise it just seems to be this vague
kind

05:57:07.868 --> 05:57:07.878 align:start position:0%
kind
 
05:57:12.190 --> 05:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
of whatever it is public benefit for one
 
05:57:14.070 --> 05:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
person could mean public benefit
 
05:57:15.670 --> 05:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
different from somebody else's
 
05:57:18.030 --> 05:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
interpretation and I think if we do
 
05:57:20.788 --> 05:57:20.798 align:start position:0%
start talking about what public benefit
 
05:57:24.070 --> 05:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
is um it's going to be
 
05:57:27.788 --> 05:57:27.798 align:start position:0%
helpful my problem was with how to
 
05:57:30.830 --> 05:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
quantify some of these things um because
 
05:57:32.548 --> 05:57:32.558 align:start position:0%
it's one thing yeah you can you can
 
05:57:35.510 --> 05:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
measure no noise you can measure odor
 
05:57:37.910 --> 05:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
you can measure how much traffic goes in
 
05:57:41.110 --> 05:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
and out um you can measure different uh
 
05:57:43.230 --> 05:57:43.240 align:start position:0%
metrics for groundwater pollution and
 
05:57:47.830 --> 05:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing but there are other
 
05:57:49.830 --> 05:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
there are other aspects that may be
 
05:57:51.110 --> 05:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
harder to
 
05:57:54.190 --> 05:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
quantify and so I I think you know we
 
05:57:57.830 --> 05:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
need to kind of take a look at that a a
 
05:58:01.190 --> 05:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
little closer but
 
05:58:04.110 --> 05:58:04.120 align:start position:0%
um I I don't I don't have a problem with
 
05:58:06.110 --> 05:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
with trying to identify what public
 
05:58:09.948 --> 05:58:09.958 align:start position:0%
benefit means representative ktoa we'll
 
05:58:12.750 --> 05:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
go around uh thank you madam
 
05:58:15.430 --> 05:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
chair I
 
05:58:18.350 --> 05:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
understand why this bill was
 
05:58:21.590 --> 05:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
introduced however what really concerned
 
05:58:24.670 --> 05:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
me was that this bill was kind of like a
 
05:58:26.990 --> 05:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
stepping stone and the prime sponsor
 
05:58:28.910 --> 05:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
said that she would hope that these
 
05:58:31.868 --> 05:58:31.878 align:start position:0%
would be included in every aspect of
 
05:58:31.878 --> 05:58:33.788 align:start position:0%
would be included in every aspect of
life

05:58:33.788 --> 05:58:33.798 align:start position:0%
life
 
05:58:37.190 --> 05:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
and we have seen in agriculture how
 
05:58:41.430 --> 05:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
things like this adversely affect
 
05:58:46.110 --> 05:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
farmers um you know we the old adages is
 
05:58:50.390 --> 05:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh you have a uh pig farm people build
 
05:58:52.670 --> 05:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
houses and then they hate the smell and
 
05:58:56.628 --> 05:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:01.590 --> 05:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
farm you know so if you define public
 
05:59:01.600 --> 05:59:03.230 align:start position:0%
farm you know so if you define public
benefit

05:59:03.230 --> 05:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
05:59:06.788 --> 05:59:06.798 align:start position:0%
who who do we look to for the benefit is
 
05:59:08.910 --> 05:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
it the farmer or the people the new
 
05:59:12.070 --> 05:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
neighborhood that just moved in I mean I
 
05:59:13.788 --> 05:59:13.798 align:start position:0%
think these are things that we really
 
05:59:16.230 --> 05:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
really need to be concerned
 
05:59:19.390 --> 05:59:19.400 align:start position:0%
about so I just want to make sure that
 
05:59:22.390 --> 05:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
as we're looking at this that from an
 
05:59:25.270 --> 05:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
agricultural standpoint we need to take
 
05:59:25.280 --> 05:59:26.430 align:start position:0%
agricultural standpoint we need to take
into

05:59:26.430 --> 05:59:26.440 align:start position:0%
into
 
05:59:29.350 --> 05:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
consideration what road we've all we've
 
05:59:32.390 --> 05:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
already been down um in regards to this
 
05:59:34.590 --> 05:59:34.600 align:start position:0%
I mean we just introduced a bill last
 
05:59:36.868 --> 05:59:36.878 align:start position:0%
year as a noise ordinance because
 
05:59:39.910 --> 05:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
farmers were having difficulty with
 
05:59:42.310 --> 05:59:42.320 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances in their towns because
 
05:59:44.830 --> 05:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
they couldn't properly start their
 
05:59:47.230 --> 05:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
equipment to
 
05:59:50.788 --> 05:59:50.798 align:start position:0%
spray lay pesticides or do something on
 
05:59:52.830 --> 05:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
their farm when they were trying to be
 
05:59:56.548 --> 05:59:56.558 align:start position:0%
in compliance with the
 
06:00:00.830 --> 06:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
law so please be when we do this let's
 
06:00:02.390 --> 06:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
be very
 
06:00:05.590 --> 06:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
cautious in how we look at
 
06:00:08.430 --> 06:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
this okay I'm gonna go around this way
 
06:00:09.788 --> 06:00:09.798 align:start position:0%
so Duty
 
06:00:13.868 --> 06:00:13.878 align:start position:0%
first okay um thank you um yeah I agree
 
06:00:16.270 --> 06:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
with what you have said I I think we
 
06:00:18.708 --> 06:00:18.718 align:start position:0%
have to look at public benefit I think
 
06:00:21.868 --> 06:00:21.878 align:start position:0%
we also got comments um that it needs to
 
06:00:25.110 --> 06:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
be Quantified I think uh representative
 
06:00:28.350 --> 06:00:28.360 align:start position:0%
Kat you know it says it's uh only
 
06:00:32.150 --> 06:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
relates to Dees permits so I don't think
 
06:00:34.030 --> 06:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
that that would affect Farms but I but I
 
06:00:36.390 --> 06:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
could be wrong uh so I would really like
 
06:00:39.390 --> 06:00:39.400 align:start position:0%
to see this go to interim study and
 
06:00:42.310 --> 06:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
really see how we could flesh out uh
 
06:00:44.628 --> 06:00:44.638 align:start position:0%
something that works because I think
 
06:00:45.910 --> 06:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
what we've heard today and what I've
 
06:00:48.948 --> 06:00:48.958 align:start position:0%
seen in Nashville with the ashal plant
 
06:00:52.350 --> 06:00:52.360 align:start position:0%
is people do not feel that their
 
06:00:54.788 --> 06:00:54.798 align:start position:0%
concerns about broader
 
06:00:58.270 --> 06:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
environmental aspects uh are being taken
 
06:01:00.070 --> 06:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
into consideration because the
 
06:01:02.830 --> 06:01:02.840 align:start position:0%
permitting is also only focused on
 
06:01:05.548 --> 06:01:05.558 align:start position:0%
technical so I would recommend I would
 
06:01:08.190 --> 06:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
vote for interim study okay
 
06:01:11.590 --> 06:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
representative Howard thank you um I I
 
06:01:14.150 --> 06:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
agree with uh representative dsy um
 
06:01:16.310 --> 06:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
about the interim study and I one of my
 
06:01:18.350 --> 06:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
concerns is that this is um it's a
 
06:01:20.350 --> 06:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
little Loosey Goosey and you know it
 
06:01:22.070 --> 06:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
talks about a demonstration you you talk
 
06:01:23.510 --> 06:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
about quantifying they're talking about
 
06:01:25.830 --> 06:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
demonstr demonstrating and I think it's
 
06:01:29.150 --> 06:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
important that that these um that the
 
06:01:31.110 --> 06:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
the benefits are are taken into consider
 
06:01:32.310 --> 06:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
I think that I think there's a big
 
06:01:34.270 --> 06:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
difference between a pig farm and and a
 
06:01:36.750 --> 06:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
a landfill so
 
06:01:39.590 --> 06:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
um so I I hope that we will do interm
 
06:01:41.670 --> 06:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
study and that we will um tighten up the
 
06:01:44.590 --> 06:01:44.600 align:start position:0%
language quite a bit okay representative
 
06:01:47.628 --> 06:01:47.638 align:start position:0%
ger yeah you yes thank you and and I
 
06:01:49.708 --> 06:01:49.718 align:start position:0%
think that studying it it further is
 
06:01:52.670 --> 06:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
important um I want to say that the the
 
06:01:55.990 --> 06:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
idea about you know the statement which
 
06:01:58.030 --> 06:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
I understand represent Thomas made
 
06:02:00.230 --> 06:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday about wanting to see this be a
 
06:02:03.548 --> 06:02:03.558 align:start position:0%
kind of a larger practice again begins
 
06:02:05.590 --> 06:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
with a discussion that was around things
 
06:02:06.830 --> 06:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
like air
 
06:02:10.070 --> 06:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
permitting uh dealing with permits to do
 
06:02:12.990 --> 06:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
with water Etc so uh it was it was
 
06:02:15.030 --> 06:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
specific to those permits that Dees
 
06:02:17.590 --> 06:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
gives to companies who are uh again
 
06:02:19.990 --> 06:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
needing air permits uh water quality
 
06:02:22.628 --> 06:02:22.638 align:start position:0%
permits Etc so it wasn't meant to be
 
06:02:24.788 --> 06:02:24.798 align:start position:0%
this expansive comprehensive seeing it
 
06:02:26.670 --> 06:02:26.680 align:start position:0%
for absolutely everything but what
 
06:02:28.190 --> 06:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
happened was when when we met with
 
06:02:30.788 --> 06:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
director whim uh they explained to us as
 
06:02:32.910 --> 06:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
Dees did uh yesterday right that you're
 
06:02:35.548 --> 06:02:35.558 align:start position:0%
looking at uh 88 different fields that
 
06:02:38.788 --> 06:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
are permitted 130 or 180 I forget what
 
06:02:41.548 --> 06:02:41.558 align:start position:0%
it was number of individual permits uh
 
06:02:45.510 --> 06:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
in lots of different places in RSA so uh
 
06:02:47.750 --> 06:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
we decided to choose specifically
 
06:02:49.910 --> 06:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
landfills because we thought that this
 
06:02:51.868 --> 06:02:51.878 align:start position:0%
was a place where we had a good chance
 
06:02:56.110 --> 06:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
to uh come up with a narrowly
 
06:03:00.628 --> 06:03:00.638 align:start position:0%
defined um uh um set of parameters and
 
06:03:02.030 --> 06:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
these are practices and this is
 
06:03:03.548 --> 06:03:03.558 align:start position:0%
something if we go to interim study that
 
06:03:05.310 --> 06:03:05.320 align:start position:0%
will come out these are things that the
 
06:03:07.750 --> 06:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
federal government does all the time and
 
06:03:09.948 --> 06:03:09.958 align:start position:0%
has since the Reagan Administration net
 
06:03:12.150 --> 06:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
public benefit has been a practice in
 
06:03:14.270 --> 06:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
the evaluation of government projects
 
06:03:16.990 --> 06:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
for practically my entire lifetime so
 
06:03:20.310 --> 06:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
we're not Reinventing the wheel here um
 
06:03:22.270 --> 06:03:22.280 align:start position:0%
I I think the one thing that's to me
 
06:03:25.430 --> 06:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
really important is that when we talk
 
06:03:27.350 --> 06:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
about net public benefit that there has
 
06:03:30.830 --> 06:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
to be a requirement on applicants to
 
06:03:33.190 --> 06:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
also address possible harm we can't
 
06:03:34.830 --> 06:03:34.840 align:start position:0%
expect communities who don't have the
 
06:03:38.230 --> 06:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
economic resources to pay somebody to do
 
06:03:40.548 --> 06:03:40.558 align:start position:0%
comprehensive studies to determine these
 
06:03:41.830 --> 06:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
things we're talking about companies who
 
06:03:45.510 --> 06:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
will make very good living um with an
 
06:03:47.708 --> 06:03:47.718 align:start position:0%
operation in a community and they should
 
06:03:51.430 --> 06:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
have to be able to demonstrate that the
 
06:03:53.628 --> 06:03:53.638 align:start position:0%
it meets a need and that in the end it
 
06:03:56.510 --> 06:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
will do more harm than good so I agree
 
06:03:59.548 --> 06:03:59.558 align:start position:0%
that further study of of how we Define
 
06:04:00.990 --> 06:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
that what the metrics are that makes
 
06:04:03.468 --> 06:04:03.478 align:start position:0%
sense to me but there's not one single
 
06:04:06.190 --> 06:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
one of us who ever makes a decision by
 
06:04:09.230 --> 06:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
just considering the benefits any
 
06:04:12.110 --> 06:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
decision any of us ever make is a cost
 
06:04:13.910 --> 06:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis you never make a
 
06:04:17.468 --> 06:04:17.478 align:start position:0%
decision without having to balance out
 
06:04:19.430 --> 06:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
potential disadvantages with potential
 
06:04:20.868 --> 06:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
advantages and that's what our system
 
06:04:23.788 --> 06:04:23.798 align:start position:0%
does right now it doesn't Define benefit
 
06:04:25.948 --> 06:04:25.958 align:start position:0%
actually very well even after the
 
06:04:27.310 --> 06:04:27.320 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision there's there's
 
06:04:31.350 --> 06:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
no specific metric for public benefit
 
06:04:34.430 --> 06:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
and we're defining benefit without
 
06:04:36.190 --> 06:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
contrasting it with disadvantage which
 
06:04:39.510 --> 06:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
as I said is literally illogical it is
 
06:04:41.708 --> 06:04:41.718 align:start position:0%
not a decision-making process that any
 
06:04:44.868 --> 06:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
of us ever use for anything in our lives
 
06:04:47.670 --> 06:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
so I I hope that we can try to find a
 
06:04:50.230 --> 06:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
way to come up with a solution that says
 
06:04:52.230 --> 06:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
net public benefit is to be determined
 
06:04:56.070 --> 06:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
by a comparison of benefits and possible
 
06:04:59.510 --> 06:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
disadvantages I so in terms of if if
 
06:05:01.670 --> 06:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
this does get voted inum study which
 
06:05:04.070 --> 06:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
I've been in favor of I think that we
 
06:05:06.230 --> 06:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
can have our Environmental Policy
 
06:05:09.350 --> 06:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee look at this along with the
 
06:05:12.430 --> 06:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
uh amendments that have been
 
06:05:15.868 --> 06:05:15.878 align:start position:0%
suggested and um and give a thorough
 
06:05:19.190 --> 06:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
study of exactly part of what
 
06:05:21.670 --> 06:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative germanus says and you
 
06:05:24.910 --> 06:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
know taking all of the testimony into
 
06:05:27.390 --> 06:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
consideration um and the I don't know
 
06:05:29.868 --> 06:05:29.878 align:start position:0%
just as a refresher of who's on the um
 
06:05:31.948 --> 06:05:31.958 align:start position:0%
Environmental Policy subcommittee we
 
06:05:35.468 --> 06:05:35.478 align:start position:0%
have representative Bixby as chair um
 
06:05:38.628 --> 06:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
representative brulard ktoa Penza Duty H
 
06:05:42.468 --> 06:05:42.478 align:start position:0%
Haskins Howard um there's veral on there
 
06:05:45.190 --> 06:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
too but we can probably have him
 
06:05:48.230 --> 06:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
replaced by someone so anyway uh just as
 
06:05:50.670 --> 06:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
a refresher go ahead and represent coma
 
06:05:52.510 --> 06:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
thank you I agree that interim study is
 
06:05:54.948 --> 06:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
a good thing and the reason I brought up
 
06:05:57.510 --> 06:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
agriculture into this is because the
 
06:06:00.030 --> 06:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor said she wanted it to be
 
06:06:03.548 --> 06:06:03.558 align:start position:0%
in everything so I just wanted to uh
 
06:06:04.910 --> 06:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
make us
 
06:06:09.110 --> 06:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
aware okay representative Bixby yeah so
 
06:06:11.788 --> 06:06:11.798 align:start position:0%
um I agree with representative gerana
 
06:06:14.788 --> 06:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
that uh there needs to be an assessment
 
06:06:17.750 --> 06:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
or of both potential harms and potential
 
06:06:20.708 --> 06:06:20.718 align:start position:0%
benefits in uh determining public
 
06:06:24.110 --> 06:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
benefit and I also agree that uh we
 
06:06:26.230 --> 06:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
can't figure out figure this out in the
 
06:06:27.510 --> 06:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
next four weeks
 
06:06:30.468 --> 06:06:30.478 align:start position:0%
so it should be inter room study okay
 
06:06:30.478 --> 06:06:31.670 align:start position:0%
so it should be inter room study okay
representative

06:06:31.670 --> 06:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:06:34.750 --> 06:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair and I to
 
06:06:36.670 --> 06:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
the point that that represent com was
 
06:06:39.350 --> 06:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
making I just want to make sure that I I
 
06:06:41.468 --> 06:06:41.478 align:start position:0%
think I just want to say that I think
 
06:06:44.150 --> 06:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
the intent and and maybe representative
 
06:06:46.150 --> 06:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
gerana spoke to this a little bit from
 
06:06:49.548 --> 06:06:49.558 align:start position:0%
the the uh one of the co-sponsors was to
 
06:06:51.350 --> 06:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
ensure that we were making sure that
 
06:06:53.750 --> 06:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
things like uh industrial polluters
 
06:06:55.708 --> 06:06:55.718 align:start position:0%
impacts to communities never happens
 
06:06:57.590 --> 06:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
again and I really think that
 
06:06:59.990 --> 06:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
in in those types of instances where my
 
06:07:03.350 --> 06:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
own two communities that I represent um
 
06:07:05.030 --> 06:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
have borne the consequences of
 
06:07:06.868 --> 06:07:06.878 align:start position:0%
industrial pollution I think that that
 
06:07:08.830 --> 06:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
was what the members intent was trying
 
06:07:10.390 --> 06:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
to get
 
06:07:15.030 --> 06:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
at and I see representative Thomas there
 
06:07:17.788 --> 06:07:17.798 align:start position:0%
I just want to let you know in this
 
06:07:19.628 --> 06:07:19.638 align:start position:0%
committee when we do something as
 
06:07:22.548 --> 06:07:22.558 align:start position:0%
interim study it's not death With
 
06:07:26.430 --> 06:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
Dignity we actually do study something
 
06:07:26.440 --> 06:07:27.590 align:start position:0%
Dignity we actually do study something
okay

06:07:27.590 --> 06:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:07:36.708 --> 06:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:41.948 --> 06:07:41.958 align:start position:0%
that please do so you're invited to do
 
06:07:44.628 --> 06:07:44.638 align:start position:0%
so a question can I say before she
 
06:07:44.638 --> 06:07:46.230 align:start position:0%
so a question can I say before she
addresses

06:07:46.230 --> 06:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
06:07:49.750 --> 06:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
that real quick my intent for that
 
06:07:52.628 --> 06:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
question was specific to what we're
 
06:07:55.390 --> 06:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
talking about like a Senco Bane th those
 
06:07:57.948 --> 06:07:57.958 align:start position:0%
types of big huge projects it would
 
06:08:00.070 --> 06:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
never have been you know a carp launch
 
06:08:02.310 --> 06:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
and I knew what your answer meant so I
 
06:08:04.390 --> 06:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
just wanted you to know I knew you
 
06:08:07.468 --> 06:08:07.478 align:start position:0%
didn't mean it for like for every
 
06:08:10.030 --> 06:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
entity right we were we're talking about
 
06:08:12.868 --> 06:08:12.878 align:start position:0%
permits that are specific to Dees
 
06:08:15.468 --> 06:08:15.478 align:start position:0%
specific with my history of my town
 
06:08:20.430 --> 06:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
being uh contaminated by St gobain um I
 
06:08:23.110 --> 06:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
am not aware of any permits that farmers
 
06:08:25.990 --> 06:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
have um and you know I I do know that
 
06:08:27.270 --> 06:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
people get upset with with noisy
 
06:08:30.390 --> 06:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
roosters so there is a noise problem but
 
06:08:33.868 --> 06:08:33.878 align:start position:0%
um that's not I it was it was the Aging
 
06:08:36.430 --> 06:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
hippie in me that that
 
06:08:39.868 --> 06:08:39.878 align:start position:0%
wants that wants justice for all you
 
06:08:41.830 --> 06:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
know so that's what I was I was not
 
06:08:44.070 --> 06:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
saying that public benefit has to be
 
06:08:45.788 --> 06:08:45.798 align:start position:0%
done for absolutely everything because
 
06:08:48.910 --> 06:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
that's not logical so it was I take full
 
06:08:52.110 --> 06:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility for that again it's it's
 
06:08:55.030 --> 06:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
the idealist in me but I was not saying
 
06:08:57.030 --> 06:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
when I when I implied that it was little
 
06:08:59.270 --> 06:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
off the cuff did not imply that it
 
06:09:02.590 --> 06:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
should be applied to everything thank
 
06:09:05.430 --> 06:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
you I would love it here I am getting
 
06:09:07.150 --> 06:09:07.160 align:start position:0%
into trouble again I would love it if
 
06:09:09.788 --> 06:09:09.798 align:start position:0%
you could consider people first and
 
06:09:12.510 --> 06:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
profit second that's that's
 
06:09:16.910 --> 06:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
all representative Katon okay all right
 
06:09:20.430 --> 06:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any comment on uh HB
 
06:09:25.590 --> 06:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
1170 thank you okay um let's see HB 1620
 
06:09:27.430 --> 06:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
relative to suspending the issuance of
 
06:09:30.190 --> 06:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
new landfill permits until
 
06:09:33.830 --> 06:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
2031 do we have any comments about that
 
06:09:36.350 --> 06:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
representative kulong uh yeah I have
 
06:09:39.070 --> 06:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
some concerns on this bill specifically
 
06:09:41.868 --> 06:09:41.878 align:start position:0%
with the year 2031 I'm a little bit
 
06:09:44.230 --> 06:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
worried that the sponsor of the bill
 
06:09:46.510 --> 06:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
threw a dart at a calendar and it landed
 
06:09:49.510 --> 06:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
on 2031 and that's the reason why and I
 
06:09:52.670 --> 06:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
haven't heard any like seeing any data
 
06:09:55.510 --> 06:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
or seeing any evidence or anything
 
06:09:59.070 --> 06:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
suggesting why the year should be 2031
 
06:10:02.150 --> 06:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
so does anybody have an objection to
 
06:10:05.788 --> 06:10:05.798 align:start position:0%
having a pause on um permitting in the
 
06:10:07.590 --> 06:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
state representative
 
06:10:11.510 --> 06:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
coma thank you madam chair
 
06:10:15.310 --> 06:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
um I think that there may come to light
 
06:10:16.548 --> 06:10:16.558 align:start position:0%
some more
 
06:10:20.350 --> 06:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
information um with the solid working
 
06:10:24.310 --> 06:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
group um I was having a discussion today
 
06:10:26.910 --> 06:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
that gave me pause for concern which I I
 
06:10:30.830 --> 06:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
didn't even know about um however we
 
06:10:32.948 --> 06:10:32.958 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of other bills
 
06:10:35.990 --> 06:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
today that if
 
06:10:39.230 --> 06:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
we limited any new
 
06:10:42.070 --> 06:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
landfill and subjected them to a
 
06:10:44.230 --> 06:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
percentage of out ofate
 
06:10:51.190 --> 06:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
waste that might be a way to go um just
 
06:10:54.430 --> 06:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
because really the the whole idea of
 
06:10:56.270 --> 06:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
either doing a pause or whatever is to
 
06:10:57.948 --> 06:10:57.958 align:start position:0%
limit out of state
 
06:11:01.350 --> 06:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
waste so my that would be my question
 
06:11:01.360 --> 06:11:02.628 align:start position:0%
waste so my that would be my question
representative

06:11:02.628 --> 06:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:11:05.390 --> 06:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
ger thank you uh I just want to say
 
06:11:08.350 --> 06:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
first of all 2031 wasn't arbitrary the
 
06:11:09.910 --> 06:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
point is that according to the solid
 
06:11:12.830 --> 06:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
waste management report 2034 is the
 
06:11:15.070 --> 06:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
earliest date at which we could begin to
 
06:11:18.708 --> 06:11:18.718 align:start position:0%
see a capacity issue so 2031 was picked
 
06:11:21.110 --> 06:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
to be three years ahead of that time so
 
06:11:22.788 --> 06:11:22.798 align:start position:0%
that there would be lead time between
 
06:11:24.948 --> 06:11:24.958 align:start position:0%
the end of the pause and when we might
 
06:11:27.868 --> 06:11:27.878 align:start position:0%
see capacity issues uh the bill also
 
06:11:30.350 --> 06:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
includes the stipulation that we that
 
06:11:33.230 --> 06:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
Dees could continue to do the
 
06:11:36.150 --> 06:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
investigations for permitting to that
 
06:11:39.430 --> 06:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
point right so that it wouldn't be just
 
06:11:41.750 --> 06:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
putting a an absolute pause on the
 
06:11:44.468 --> 06:11:44.478 align:start position:0%
entire process um so I just wanted to
 
06:11:46.628 --> 06:11:46.638 align:start position:0%
clarify those things and I don't know if
 
06:11:48.948 --> 06:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
it's possible and I agree representative
 
06:11:50.510 --> 06:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
comad just made an excellent point about
 
06:11:51.830 --> 06:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
other bills that we have that would
 
06:11:55.788 --> 06:11:55.798 align:start position:0%
solve these problems um and uh so I
 
06:11:57.350 --> 06:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's possible to consider
 
06:12:00.070 --> 06:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
retaining this bill uh because we don't
 
06:12:01.670 --> 06:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
oh no because it's the second year
 
06:12:03.190 --> 06:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
second year okay well that answers that
 
06:12:06.548 --> 06:12:06.558 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative Bixby
 
06:12:10.510 --> 06:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so um I think that uh having some
 
06:12:13.788 --> 06:12:13.798 align:start position:0%
sort of a pause makes sense uh I think
 
06:12:18.230 --> 06:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
that um we heard that uh there is a a
 
06:12:22.310 --> 06:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
cycle time for uh what it takes to
 
06:12:25.270 --> 06:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
propose and get a new per new landfill
 
06:12:26.990 --> 06:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
permitted that would would be longer
 
06:12:30.390 --> 06:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
than that three years between uh 2031
 
06:12:30.400 --> 06:12:31.230 align:start position:0%
than that three years between uh 2031
and

06:12:31.230 --> 06:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:12:35.150 --> 06:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
2034 um I would just uh throw out there
 
06:12:37.468 --> 06:12:37.478 align:start position:0%
that perhaps we would make want to make
 
06:12:41.788 --> 06:12:41.798 align:start position:0%
that pause until maybe 2028 so that we
 
06:12:43.948 --> 06:12:43.958 align:start position:0%
are able to see what the results of the
 
06:12:45.910 --> 06:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
bill the other bills we're working on
 
06:12:51.590 --> 06:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
right now uh are and then uh that and
 
06:12:54.868 --> 06:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
then new permits could be issued in the
 
06:12:57.270 --> 06:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
light of the new thing of the bills that
 
06:12:58.510 --> 06:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
that are working through right the
 
06:12:59.910 --> 06:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
process right
 
06:13:02.670 --> 06:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
now representive kulon yes so I just
 
06:13:04.590 --> 06:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
want to be clear like my number one
 
06:13:08.628 --> 06:13:08.638 align:start position:0%
concern is the price and the price like
 
06:13:11.310 --> 06:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
the area that I represent we have all
 
06:13:14.948 --> 06:13:14.958 align:start position:0%
private waste and the price has gone up
 
06:13:16.590 --> 06:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
when I asked it when I asked the
 
06:13:19.230 --> 06:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
economic question you know I got a
 
06:13:21.628 --> 06:13:21.638 align:start position:0%
question I got an answer that was like
 
06:13:24.750 --> 06:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
well yeah prices could go up for you
 
06:13:27.310 --> 06:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
know fuel costs to go into a different
 
06:13:29.510 --> 06:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
site all these different answers and
 
06:13:32.948 --> 06:13:32.958 align:start position:0%
then the fiscal note says indeterminable
 
06:13:34.830 --> 06:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
increase so it seems like the fiscal
 
06:13:38.628 --> 06:13:38.638 align:start position:0%
note is actually correct on this bill um
 
06:13:40.670 --> 06:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
so yeah if we could adjust the date that
 
06:13:42.430 --> 06:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
would make it or the year that would
 
06:13:46.190 --> 06:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
make it a little bit more amenable I
 
06:13:48.868 --> 06:13:48.878 align:start position:0%
think represent
 
06:13:50.910 --> 06:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
Penza was this the bill where the
 
06:13:52.708 --> 06:13:52.718 align:start position:0%
gentleman came and spoke about the
 
06:13:57.070 --> 06:13:57.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I I yes yeah okay yeah
 
06:14:00.230 --> 06:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
um so it's to me I think what he said
 
06:14:02.510 --> 06:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
was really impactful I think he covered
 
06:14:04.310 --> 06:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
that clearly because this really
 
06:14:06.830 --> 06:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have it couldn't have any
 
06:14:09.430 --> 06:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
impact so if prices are going to
 
06:14:11.468 --> 06:14:11.478 align:start position:0%
increase this it won't have anything to
 
06:14:14.750 --> 06:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
do with this moratorium Bill I'm in full
 
06:14:16.628 --> 06:14:16.638 align:start position:0%
support of this bill I think we don't
 
06:14:20.390 --> 06:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
have a capacity issue um if we if you
 
06:14:23.070 --> 06:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
know the Committees for taking off a
 
06:14:25.310 --> 06:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
couple years it's fine but I believe
 
06:14:28.468 --> 06:14:28.478 align:start position:0%
that the testimony that was given was
 
06:14:34.310 --> 06:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
like so powerful especially 19 years of
 
06:14:36.708 --> 06:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
not being able to figure this out I've
 
06:14:39.590 --> 06:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
only been here a year I get it but it's
 
06:14:41.868 --> 06:14:41.878 align:start position:0%
unbelievable that all you know and I
 
06:14:43.030 --> 06:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
know that there's people that have been
 
06:14:45.708 --> 06:14:45.718 align:start position:0%
here a lot longer and they you know
 
06:14:47.670 --> 06:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
we're churning through these things and
 
06:14:49.788 --> 06:14:49.798 align:start position:0%
and I think the time is now I think
 
06:14:52.390 --> 06:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
we're ready um and I think the time has
 
06:14:57.110 --> 06:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
been here for a while but um I know that
 
06:14:59.830 --> 06:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
um I know that people my constituents
 
06:15:03.628 --> 06:15:03.638 align:start position:0%
are are wanting something as well and um
 
06:15:05.390 --> 06:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
you know I I feel like I have more skin
 
06:15:07.190 --> 06:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
in the game I have there's a landfill
 
06:15:09.270 --> 06:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
that is you know uh three miles down the
 
06:15:13.190 --> 06:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
road from where I live so um and I just
 
06:15:14.788 --> 06:15:14.798 align:start position:0%
have to say that the conversations that
 
06:15:17.310 --> 06:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
I've had with the folks that um run our
 
06:15:19.628 --> 06:15:19.638 align:start position:0%
landfill are are fantastic they're open
 
06:15:22.270 --> 06:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
they're honest they're transparent um
 
06:15:25.708 --> 06:15:25.718 align:start position:0%
and and those are the things where I I
 
06:15:25.718 --> 06:15:27.390 align:start position:0%
and and those are the things where I I
they're

06:15:27.390 --> 06:15:27.400 align:start position:0%
they're
 
06:15:28.830 --> 06:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
they can't come out and speak on
 
06:15:32.430 --> 06:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
something like this but if they could um
 
06:15:33.990 --> 06:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
I believe that they would support this
 
06:15:35.590 --> 06:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
because there needs to be worked done
 
06:15:38.030 --> 06:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
and we all know that there
 
06:15:41.190 --> 06:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
does represent Murray yeah thank you
 
06:15:43.230 --> 06:15:43.240 align:start position:0%
madam chair um one of the things that
 
06:15:45.708 --> 06:15:45.718 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about really intentionally
 
06:15:47.350 --> 06:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
is how many irons we have in the fire
 
06:15:49.830 --> 06:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
this year around solid waste and I feel
 
06:15:52.390 --> 06:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
like um we had two days of testimony
 
06:15:55.628 --> 06:15:55.638 align:start position:0%
just now on landfilling and um when
 
06:15:56.420 --> 06:15:56.430 align:start position:0%
we're talking
 
06:15:56.430 --> 06:15:57.750 align:start position:0%
we're talking
[Music]

06:15:57.750 --> 06:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:16:00.868 --> 06:16:00.878 align:start position:0%
about other policies that are sort of
 
06:16:03.788 --> 06:16:03.798 align:start position:0%
influx as well as um what we're looking
 
06:16:03.798 --> 06:16:04.708 align:start position:0%
influx as well as um what we're looking
at

06:16:04.708 --> 06:16:04.718 align:start position:0%
at
 
06:16:09.390 --> 06:16:09.400 align:start position:0%
with um the potential pause on issuance
 
06:16:10.990 --> 06:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
of permits and I think that that's the
 
06:16:13.910 --> 06:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
key factor here nothing is uh suggesting
 
06:16:15.990 --> 06:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
that we stop with the process that is
 
06:16:18.030 --> 06:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
continuing away it's just we're pressing
 
06:16:21.468 --> 06:16:21.478 align:start position:0%
pause on issuing any new ones until we
 
06:16:23.430 --> 06:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
get a better sense of like
 
06:16:25.830 --> 06:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby said where some of
 
06:16:28.548 --> 06:16:28.558 align:start position:0%
these things are going and I I don't
 
06:16:31.628 --> 06:16:31.638 align:start position:0%
know what representative ktoa had sort
 
06:16:34.190 --> 06:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
of intimated at with regard to Solid
 
06:16:37.110 --> 06:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
Waste working group but I would is I is
 
06:16:39.670 --> 06:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
that what you
 
06:16:43.350 --> 06:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah so I had a uh conversation
 
06:16:46.628 --> 06:16:46.638 align:start position:0%
with um representative eel and um
 
06:16:47.990 --> 06:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
believe it was
 
06:16:52.070 --> 06:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
Steve POI out in the hallway um and I do
 
06:16:54.150 --> 06:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
believe Steve's going to be coming to
 
06:16:56.548 --> 06:16:56.558 align:start position:0%
your committee on
 
06:17:03.390 --> 06:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
on March 6 to discuss further um so
 
06:17:06.150 --> 06:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead
 
06:17:09.628 --> 06:17:09.638 align:start position:0%
represent uh thank you ma'am yeah I I
 
06:17:12.430 --> 06:17:12.440 align:start position:0%
just really like what representative R
 
06:17:14.788 --> 06:17:14.798 align:start position:0%
just said the I'm sitting here looking
 
06:17:16.590 --> 06:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
and so you're you're talking about
 
06:17:20.230 --> 06:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
reducing inate to 15% you're talking
 
06:17:22.868 --> 06:17:22.878 align:start position:0%
about a seven-year moratorium you're
 
06:17:25.990 --> 06:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
talking about a rules committee that is
 
06:17:28.430 --> 06:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
changing rules and then you know
 
06:17:30.030 --> 06:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
continually upgrading those for the next
 
06:17:32.788 --> 06:17:32.798 align:start position:0%
3 months and so there just there's a lot
 
06:17:34.628 --> 06:17:34.638 align:start position:0%
of churn
 
06:17:36.830 --> 06:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm just I don't want to break
 
06:17:39.030 --> 06:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
anything in our haste to fix everything
 
06:17:41.270 --> 06:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
and we're doing a lot of fixing and to
 
06:17:43.590 --> 06:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
figure out because all that is based on
 
06:17:45.628 --> 06:17:45.638 align:start position:0%
assumption there's assumption there's
 
06:17:48.230 --> 06:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
analysis but no one has a crystal ball
 
06:17:51.070 --> 06:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
so I would be in favor of a pause I
 
06:17:53.510 --> 06:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
would say 27 instead of 28 but I'm not
 
06:17:56.310 --> 06:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
going to fall on my sword on that I just
 
06:17:58.788 --> 06:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
think we do need to just make sure that
 
06:18:01.230 --> 06:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is having the intended
 
06:18:05.390 --> 06:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
effect and not breaking other things
 
06:18:08.510 --> 06:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
over representative NAB thank you madam
 
06:18:10.830 --> 06:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
chair um I mean I agree we have a lot of
 
06:18:12.430 --> 06:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
irons in the fire but we also don't have
 
06:18:13.750 --> 06:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
control of the outcome of all these
 
06:18:15.350 --> 06:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
bills right we can only do what we can
 
06:18:19.350 --> 06:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
do so I don't see a a real conflict with
 
06:18:20.948 --> 06:18:20.958 align:start position:0%
some of these landfill bills I also
 
06:18:22.628 --> 06:18:22.638 align:start position:0%
think if the permanent process is on
 
06:18:25.150 --> 06:18:25.160 align:start position:0%
average 6 to 10 years that having a
 
06:18:27.750 --> 06:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
pause till 2030 is 6 years from now it's
 
06:18:29.468 --> 06:18:29.478 align:start position:0%
not really that far in the future and if
 
06:18:31.070 --> 06:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
we're allowing landfill permitting the
 
06:18:33.948 --> 06:18:33.958 align:start position:0%
process to still continue it doesn't
 
06:18:36.110 --> 06:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately hinder a company that is
 
06:18:37.590 --> 06:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
trying to site a new
 
06:18:41.030 --> 06:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
landfill so all I have to say thank you
 
06:18:44.110 --> 06:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins thank you madam
 
06:18:46.510 --> 06:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
chair I think the reason why we have all
 
06:18:48.788 --> 06:18:48.798 align:start position:0%
these landfill bills is because we're
 
06:18:51.708 --> 06:18:51.718 align:start position:0%
waking up to what's going on in our
 
06:18:54.468 --> 06:18:54.478 align:start position:0%
state and I think people care
 
06:18:57.830 --> 06:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
desperately about what we are going to
 
06:19:00.708 --> 06:19:00.718 align:start position:0%
do about this problem and it's a
 
06:19:03.468 --> 06:19:03.478 align:start position:0%
multifaceted problem for sure and the
 
06:19:06.230 --> 06:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
out ofate waste bill doesn't answer the
 
06:19:08.750 --> 06:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
question about the fact that Dees is
 
06:19:11.788 --> 06:19:11.798 align:start position:0%
trying to write rules review an
 
06:19:14.670 --> 06:19:14.680 align:start position:0%
application at the same time which
 
06:19:17.910 --> 06:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
frankly to me never made sense so I do
 
06:19:20.230 --> 06:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
think we need to pause I guess the bill
 
06:19:22.788 --> 06:19:22.798 align:start position:0%
says they can review it I don't really
 
06:19:25.868 --> 06:19:25.878 align:start position:0%
know what that means but they can't
 
06:19:28.150 --> 06:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
issue the permit at least until we
 
06:19:30.628 --> 06:19:30.638 align:start position:0%
settle some of these issues and make
 
06:19:33.788 --> 06:19:33.798 align:start position:0%
some delineation about public benefit
 
06:19:37.830 --> 06:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
and public harm yeah and out ofate trash
 
06:19:40.788 --> 06:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
and all the rest so I I see them as
 
06:19:43.270 --> 06:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
distinct they're a lot and it's a lot of
 
06:19:45.990 --> 06:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
work for us I'm willing to do my share
 
06:19:49.990 --> 06:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
of the work it matters greatly to me so
 
06:19:53.190 --> 06:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
I I hope that we do get the
 
06:19:56.350 --> 06:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
pause okay representative Howard
 
06:19:59.590 --> 06:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I I agree with
 
06:20:01.750 --> 06:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative H Haskins I think that
 
06:20:04.910 --> 06:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
um that a pause will give us time to
 
06:20:07.110 --> 06:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
sort these other things out and it's it
 
06:20:10.230 --> 06:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
it it's five or seven years whichever
 
06:20:12.670 --> 06:20:12.680 align:start position:0%
date we pick is nothing compared to the
 
06:20:13.990 --> 06:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
forever of these chemicals that are
 
06:20:16.670 --> 06:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
leaking into our um into our at our
 
06:20:19.468 --> 06:20:19.478 align:start position:0%
environment so I think that um you know
 
06:20:23.390 --> 06:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
if if a permit came to Dees or whatever
 
06:20:26.070 --> 06:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
yeah Dees um that said that had the
 
06:20:27.830 --> 06:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
solution for forever chemicals if they
 
06:20:29.990 --> 06:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
said we want to build a land landfill
 
06:20:32.070 --> 06:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
and we know exactly what to do about
 
06:20:35.708 --> 06:20:35.718 align:start position:0%
about the Le Lee it um then I would say
 
06:20:37.590 --> 06:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
yes let's let's permit it right away but
 
06:20:39.750 --> 06:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have that and the and what they
 
06:20:41.590 --> 06:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
leave behind or what they enter into our
 
06:20:44.390 --> 06:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
environment is is much more longterm
 
06:20:46.110 --> 06:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
than what they would have to wait to to
 
06:20:48.030 --> 06:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
put their to get their permit approved
 
06:20:48.040 --> 06:20:49.468 align:start position:0%
put their to get their permit approved
represent

06:20:49.468 --> 06:20:49.478 align:start position:0%
represent
 
06:20:52.670 --> 06:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
kulon uh yeah I think life in America
 
06:20:55.230 --> 06:20:55.240 align:start position:0%
has changed drastically in the past five
 
06:20:58.910 --> 06:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
years and I also think Dees is capable
 
06:21:01.910 --> 06:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
of multitasking so this idea that like
 
06:21:03.910 --> 06:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
we need to stop the permits so this
 
06:21:07.230 --> 06:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
other stuff can be done I mean d manages
 
06:21:10.468 --> 06:21:10.478 align:start position:0%
to come here and talk about bills and
 
06:21:13.270 --> 06:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
trash goes to the landfill it all kind
 
06:21:16.750 --> 06:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
of still happens so uh I can support the
 
06:21:20.390 --> 06:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
bill if the year changes not to be 2031
 
06:21:22.910 --> 06:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
because I feel like that's uh
 
06:21:22.920 --> 06:21:24.628 align:start position:0%
because I feel like that's uh
irresponsible

06:21:24.628 --> 06:21:24.638 align:start position:0%
irresponsible
 
06:21:24.638 --> 06:21:28.948 align:start position:0%
irresponsible
honestly

06:21:28.948 --> 06:21:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:33.270 --> 06:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
any other well let's let's talk about
 
06:21:35.390 --> 06:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
what year we would be comfortable with
 
06:21:37.110 --> 06:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
because ultimately if we're going to
 
06:21:38.948 --> 06:21:38.958 align:start position:0%
make an amendment to this bill I think
 
06:21:41.990 --> 06:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
that that the year is going to be um
 
06:21:45.270 --> 06:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
something that would be the
 
06:21:50.310 --> 06:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
negotiating notion so um give us a give
 
06:21:52.468 --> 06:21:52.478 align:start position:0%
us a thought I would agree with
 
06:21:54.990 --> 06:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
representative bixby's 28 I was going to
 
06:21:57.380 --> 06:21:57.390 align:start position:0%
say I agree with representative Katon
 
06:21:57.390 --> 06:22:01.350 align:start position:0%
say I agree with representative Katon
[Laughter]

[Laughter]
 
06:22:01.360 --> 06:22:07.670 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
2027

06:22:07.670 --> 06:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:19.628 --> 06:22:19.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:22.830 --> 06:22:22.840 align:start position:0%

06:26:51.230 --> 06:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
okay and with that I want to thank
 
06:26:55.190 --> 06:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
everybody for um all the work you guys
 
06:26:57.590 --> 06:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
have been doing um the tedious hours to
 
06:27:00.830 --> 06:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
listening and sitting patiently asking
 
06:27:03.270 --> 06:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
questions really good questions by the
 
06:27:06.070 --> 06:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
way and um just having these
 
06:27:07.788 --> 06:27:07.798 align:start position:0%
conversations and working through some
 
06:27:10.230 --> 06:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
things represent Bixby okay so on a
 
06:27:13.468 --> 06:27:13.478 align:start position:0%
slightly different topic I um ran into
 
06:27:19.190 --> 06:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
Henry vo who is the uh um uh uh lobbyist
 
06:27:23.310 --> 06:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
who works with waste management and um
 
06:27:25.468 --> 06:27:25.478 align:start position:0%
mentioned the possibility of doing a
 
06:27:28.350 --> 06:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
committee field trip later in the spring
 
06:27:33.548 --> 06:27:33.558 align:start position:0%
uh to uh to TurnKey and on Waste
 
06:27:35.628 --> 06:27:35.638 align:start position:0%
Management also has a murf in Northern
 
06:27:38.390 --> 06:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so uh he said that they
 
06:27:41.070 --> 06:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
would be able to do arrange a t a field
 
06:27:44.910 --> 06:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
trip for both turny and uh and to the
 
06:27:48.390 --> 06:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
murf um so that uh we could get to see
 
06:27:50.548 --> 06:27:50.558 align:start position:0%
what those two types of facilities look
 
06:27:53.468 --> 06:27:53.478 align:start position:0%
like uh so I think that's something the
 
06:27:55.590 --> 06:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
dates haven't been nailed down yet but
 
06:27:57.350 --> 06:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
um that's something to look forward to
 
06:28:12.510 --> 06:28:12.520 align:start position:0%
