00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
all right good morning uh
 
00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
just welcome to Joe Carr we have a
 
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
number of things we have to do and it
 
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
looks like we might have trouble
 
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
maintaining a quorum after 10 o'clock so
 
00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:14.939 align:start position:0%
I'd appreciate everyone being efficient
 
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
all right rep director Morrow
 
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
um for the members and for the audience
 
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
we do not have our court stenographer
 
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
today uh it's her 50th wedding
 
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
anniversary so she is absent uh that
 
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
means the transcript of the meeting will
 
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 align:start position:0%
be thank you
 
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
will be done afterwards by her but it
 
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
will be done using the minutes that the
 
00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 align:start position:0%
attorneys keep and the
 
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
video recording of this meeting that
 
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
means I would urge you to when you speak
 
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
make sure your microphone is on and make
 
00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 align:start position:0%
sure it's close enough to you so that
 
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
the audio will be clear
 
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.030 align:start position:0%
the audio will be clear
also

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.810 align:start position:0%
also
um

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 align:start position:0%
it was raised by a couple of members at
 
00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 align:start position:0%
the last meeting there is discrepancies
 
00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 align:start position:0%
between your written agenda it's printed
 
00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 align:start position:0%
out for you and the committee packet
 
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
that's online
 
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
the committee packet
 
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
is a little confusing because some final
 
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
proposals are listed in bold
 
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
that's only the ones that have more than
 
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
electronic item with them the others are
 
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
not in bulk so that makes it a little
 
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
confusing also the order that you see in
 
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
the meeting packet is not in the same
 
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
order as in the printed agenda that of
 
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
the printed agenda is correct we've
 
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
talked with it about this and it cannot
 
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
be corrected at least at this time if
 
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
they make try to make a structural
 
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 align:start position:0%
change to meeting packet then it throws
 
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
off everything else in the meeting
 
00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 align:start position:0%
packet hopefully in the future that will
 
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:04.259 align:start position:0%
down the online version to get what we
 
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
want correct okay
 
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
so we only have regular members so far
 
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
except for Senator Gray
 
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 align:start position:0%
and he can sit in for Senator and this
 
00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 align:start position:0%
and represent hack and Phillips
 
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
is expected and when she shows up she
 
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
can sit in for representative hatch
 
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes we did hear from
 
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
representative groda this morning and
 
00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
she will not be attending
 
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
that's why I didn't mention her
 
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.090 align:start position:0%
that's why I didn't mention her
okay

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 align:start position:0%
we'll be here we'll be sick if she does
 
00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:43.259 align:start position:0%
if you can sit in for Senator walk
 
00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley
 
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 align:start position:0%

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 align:start position:0%

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 align:start position:0%

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 align:start position:0%

and I'd like to comment that all the
 
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
people that seem to be interested in
 
00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:55.140 align:start position:0%
fish the fish and game rules is that we
 
00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:57.959 align:start position:0%
are not a policy committee we are not
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
going to hear any testimony on any of
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
the policy involved in setting the uh
 
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
rules and and uh schedules
 
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.110 align:start position:0%
rules and and uh schedules
so

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.590 align:start position:0%
so
uh

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
um yes this is um 2022 60. yes the
 
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
wildlife rules and licenses and permits
 
00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:23.339 align:start position:0%
um the rule did receive a lot of public
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
tax testimonies so there's just a few
 
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.329 align:start position:0%
tax testimonies so there's just a few
things

00:09:26.329 --> 00:09:26.339 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
that I want to go over
 
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.269 align:start position:0%
that I want to go over
um

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
one is that the there were some
 
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
questions about the public notice
 
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
um which notice for the hearings appears
 
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
in the rule making register once a week
 
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
this had three hearings
 
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
um some people said that there may have
 
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:47.220 align:start position:0%
been some religious discrimination
 
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:50.820 align:start position:0%
because one of them fell on Passover
 
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
um but it does not appear it appears
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
that the person that was complaining was
 
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
actually at one of the other three meet
 
00:09:59.810 --> 00:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
of the meetings and submitted public
 
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.370 align:start position:0%
of the meetings and submitted public
testimony

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
um so I don't believe that this Rises to
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
the level of religious discrimination
 
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.910 align:start position:0%
the level of religious discrimination
um

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:10.580 align:start position:0%
the many of the
 
00:10:14.449 --> 00:10:14.459 align:start position:0%
comments also used a um
 
00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:19.019 align:start position:0%
a percentage of 96 people 96 of the
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
population of New Hampshire and it's
 
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
used in different ways and I can't
 
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
confirm where that number came from so
 
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
just be aware of that or if you're
 
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
looking at the testimony
 
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:30.829 align:start position:0%
looking at the testimony
um

00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
and then like you said the
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
so that the statute
 
00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:38.540 align:start position:0%
um doesn't require
 
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
the commission or the department to
 
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
incorporate public comment it only
 
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
requires that they consider it
 
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
um and so this is a um
 
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
like just because somebody gives
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
testimony does not mean that they have
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
to put it in their rules
 
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
um they simply have to consider it so
 
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
this is a statutory issue if people want
 
00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
this policy changed they need to go to
 
00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:10.740 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.350 align:start position:0%
the legislature
um

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
Dr Morrow uh thank you I'd also add that
 
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
I noticed the majority of the public
 
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:26.220 align:start position:0%
comment uh said that the rules contrary
 
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
to public interest that is a basis for
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
committee objection however it appears
 
00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:33.779 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:11:37.569 --> 00:11:37.579 align:start position:0%
emails Etc that were sent that
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
contrary to public interest in the
 
00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
Public's mind appeared to be that it's a
 
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
bad idea uh because as the chair said
 
00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839 align:start position:0%
gel car is not a policy committee it is
 
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
not up to them to determine whether
 
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
something is a good idea or a bad idea
 
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
uh the committee has very limited basis
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
specific bases under their own rules as
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
to what is contrary to the public
 
00:12:01.079 --> 00:12:21.230 align:start position:0%
to what is contrary to the public
interest

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
I'm Marty Mobley I'm the legal
 
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
coordinator for fish and game and with
 
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:29.220 align:start position:0%
me today is Dan Bergeron the chief of
 
00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
our Wildlife Division and Andy Timmons
 
00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:34.380 align:start position:0%
who is the head of our game program
 
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
by Statute fish and game is required to
 
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
set season dates and bag limits for
 
00:12:44.449 --> 00:12:44.459 align:start position:0%
hunting and fishing these just deal with
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
the hunting aspect fishing rules are
 
00:12:49.009 --> 00:12:49.019 align:start position:0%
something different and because we have
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
put into rule the dates in themselves
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
for two years every two years we need to
 
00:12:57.889 --> 00:12:57.899 align:start position:0%
change the rules to update the date and
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
we also have a 10-year game management
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
plan and we we set the bag limits to
 
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
keep up with the game management plan
 
00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
the only other changes in these rules is
 
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
that we are incorporating an online deer
 
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
registration as required and mandated by
 
00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:17.339 align:start position:0%
Statute or legislation that was passed
 
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:20.700 align:start position:0%
and we are adding a couple of
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
definitions reaping and Fanning which
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
are prohibited practices associated with
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
um I think that's about that's about all
 
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
that we're doing there
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions all right
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:41.220 align:start position:0%
were some
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
um Clarity comments on the rule but the
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
agency and I went through all of them
 
00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:50.339 align:start position:0%
and they were all cleared up so
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
all right are there any questions from
 
00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
we would like a statement from the
 
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
agency that you heard all the public
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
comments and have considered them yes
 
00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
ma'am in fact we actually did adjust a
 
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
couple of things due to public comments
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
there was some uh there was a request to
 
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
expand the use of crossbows in Wildlife
 
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:00.180 align:start position:0%
Management unit L to be so we have done
 
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
that in this in this rulemaking so
 
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:05.220 align:start position:0%
anyone with an archery license in
 
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
hunting in WMU Wildlife Management unit
 
00:15:13.009 --> 00:15:13.019 align:start position:0%
L can use their archery license and a
 
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
crossbow and um we were originally
 
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
intending to make it so that um you did
 
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
not have to register one turkey before
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
you took your second turkey in the fall
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
hunting season but there was some
 
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
concerns about that so we have re based
 
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
on public comment we removed that and
 
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
now it's gone back to that that you have
 
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
to register one turkey and then take the
 
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
second turkey all right thank you
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
Megan okay moved by Senator Lang
 
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Lynn any
 
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
discussion comments questions
 
00:15:53.449 --> 00:15:53.459 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none
 
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
for those in favor
 
00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:03.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
all right uh Department of Safety
 
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh so the next item on the agenda
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
because uh 159 was postponed is going to
 
00:16:15.069 --> 00:16:15.079 align:start position:0%
be 20 22
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
186. the agency did submit a conditional
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
approval for this particular proposal
 
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
that addressed uh
 
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
pretty much all the substantive comments
 
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
however it did convert some of the
 
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
comments into notes to the committee
 
00:16:32.689 --> 00:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
just for informational purposes if the
 
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
committee would like me to go over them
 
00:16:36.769 --> 00:16:36.779 align:start position:0%
I certainly will but I will go over at
 
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
least the first one which is found on
 
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
page one of the rule
 
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
the rule specifically says
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
that in the event of a dispute regarding
 
00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
the interpretation of the federal
 
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
standard of application of any rule
 
00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.850 align:start position:0%
standard of application of any rule
Incorporated

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:52.860 align:start position:0%
Incorporated
 
00:16:55.249 --> 00:16:55.259 align:start position:0%
by these rules
 
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
the federal interpretation of the rule
 
00:16:59.810 --> 00:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
as it appears in the Federal Register or
 
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
the most recent version of the Federal
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
Motor Carrier safety administration
 
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
motor care regulation information system
 
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
shall be used now the statute that
 
00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
addresses that is RSA 266 colon 72a
 
00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
where the statute specifically allows
 
00:17:21.289 --> 00:17:21.299 align:start position:0%
the agency to incorporate the Federal
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
Regulations into their rules and
 
00:17:26.689 --> 00:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
additionally that if any amendments or
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
additions are made to that the federal
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
rules that have been adopted they are
 
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
automatically applied to the rules
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
without any further action on part of
 
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
with regard to I'd like to comment on
 
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
that section it's blatantly
 
00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.010 align:start position:0%
that section it's blatantly
unconstitutional

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:45.020 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
the using the interpretation and the
 
00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
Federal Register is fine if it's you
 
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
know an explanation or whatever but
 
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
saying that the commissioner can adopt
 
00:17:58.850 --> 00:17:58.860 align:start position:0%
the latest version without going through
 
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
rulemaking or having any approval is
 
00:18:03.529 --> 00:18:03.539 align:start position:0%
against the Constitutional Clause that
 
00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
says no law that has not been approved
 
00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
by the people or their elected
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
representatives needs to be followed
 
00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
so I hope you're uh
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
the agency is prepared to deal with that
 
00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:18.059 align:start position:0%
and we I expect I'll be pursuing a
 
00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
statutory fix
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
and just to address that comment as well
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
on my end I did look into that
 
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
particular concern and
 
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
under chapter 4 section three point
 
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
one two of the manual
 
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
um as the committee may know normally
 
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
yes you have to include a date when
 
00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:39.539 align:start position:0%
incorporating a particular
 
00:18:39.539 --> 00:18:41.150 align:start position:0%
incorporating a particular
uh

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
document or Internet content by
 
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
reference however there is an exception
 
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
if it's allowed by Statute and there are
 
00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:54.200 align:start position:0%
actually two other statutes in RSA
 
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.870 align:start position:0%
actually two other statutes in RSA
541a21

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
541a21
 
00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
for two other agencies that specifically
 
00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
allow them to incorporate those
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
incorporate documents into their rules
 
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:08.100 align:start position:0%
without including a date one of them is
 
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
for DHHS which has to do with the
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Federal Medicaid regulations
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
and the other one is for the Department
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
of Transportation with regard to some of
 
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
their internal manuals so I just wanted
 
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
to also bring that to the committee's
 
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.010 align:start position:0%
to also bring that to the committee's
attention

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
attention
 
00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:25.970 align:start position:0%
attention
lovely

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
all right any questions comments
 
00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:33.070 align:start position:0%
all right any questions comments
okay

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
unless you want me to go over the other
 
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
notes please I think we've sure so the
 
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
next note is on page two of the rule
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
text with regard to the definition of a
 
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
serious traffic violation this statute's
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
also very unique in that normally when
 
00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
you adopt a definition that's defined in
 
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
statute you have to mirror the format
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
and language however this particular
 
00:19:59.810 --> 00:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
statute not only lists what's considered
 
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
a serious traffic violation it also
 
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
allows the agency to adopt rules
 
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
that would also constitute a serious
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
traffic violation so that's why it's not
 
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
exact to the statute because the agency
 
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
is actually adopting additional
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
serious traffic violations in that role
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
the next one is on page four of the role
 
00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:23.900 align:start position:0%
text it has to do with
 
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
some dates that are really no longer
 
00:20:29.529 --> 00:20:29.539 align:start position:0%
relevant anyone who was born
 
00:20:33.169 --> 00:20:33.179 align:start position:0%
prior to January 1st 2011 is is now over
 
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
21. so it's not a relevant paragraph
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
however after conversation with the
 
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
agency they want to keep it in because
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
that is still what is listed in the
 
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.909 align:start position:0%
that is still what is listed in the
statute

00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:42.919 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:20:45.409 --> 00:20:45.419 align:start position:0%
so even though it's irrelevant it really
 
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:48.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:58.970 --> 00:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh yes so yes that at the top paragraph
 
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:04.850 align:start position:0%
uh yes so yes that at the top paragraph
C

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:04.860 align:start position:0%
C
 
00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:05.810 align:start position:0%
C
um

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
and that actually should have been
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
highlighted to paragraph B
 
00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
um so I apologize for that um regarding
 
00:21:15.289 --> 00:21:15.299 align:start position:0%
RSA 21p 18.
 
00:21:15.299 --> 00:21:16.190 align:start position:0%
RSA 21p 18.
um

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
so that was the top uh comment and then
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
the next note to jail on that particular
 
00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
K page
 
00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
um the statute specifically includes
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
only if being driven in interstate
 
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.270 align:start position:0%
only if being driven in interstate
commerce

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
commerce
 
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:32.039 align:start position:0%
um with regard to K
 
00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
if that particular rule however after
 
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
talking with the agency the agency did
 
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
point out that in their introductory
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
language they do use inter Towing in
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce so that would
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
address uh that comment that I had as
 
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:53.990 align:start position:0%
address uh that comment that I had as
well

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:01.630 align:start position:0%
good morning
Mike

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm attorney Dave hiltz I'm
 
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
here for the Department of Safety um uh
 
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
unless the committee has any other uh
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
specific uh Focus uh questions that they
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
have I just want to address the issue of
 
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.750 align:start position:0%
have I just want to address the issue of
constitutionality

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
constitutionality
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
um so you know the the department
 
00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
obviously can't dispute that the
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
legislature is the final you know
 
00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
Arbiter decision maker on on policy
 
00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
however it seems clear to the department
 
00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
that the legislature has at least up
 
00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
until this point expressed a clear
 
00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
policy decision that it is acceptable
 
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
and legal to enact uh rulemaking
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
Authority that allows an agency to
 
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
incorporate by reference
 
00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
third-party materials without specifying
 
00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
a particular date or addition
 
00:22:59.330 --> 00:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
and as attorney Ricard pointed out the
 
00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
evidence of that is not only in the
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
statutes that we're talking about but
 
00:23:06.909 --> 00:23:06.919 align:start position:0%
other statutes you know that pertain to
 
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
DHHS and Dot and those statutes live in
 
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
this committee's statutes they're in
 
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:17.700 align:start position:0%
541a they're in 541a 21 Roman 8 and 541a
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
21 Roman nine and also that in the
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
committee's rulemaking manual it's
 
00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:29.700 align:start position:0%
specifically uh contemplates this
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
activity and again since it's brief I'll
 
00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:36.299 align:start position:0%
be redundant the manual says that an
 
00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:38.820 align:start position:0%
agency has to you know as long an agency
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
can incorporate outside material as long
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
as the agency identifies in the rule and
 
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
abides by a specific addition or date of
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
the document or a read-only dated copy
 
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
of otherwise undated internet content
 
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
and does not automatically adopt future
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
amendments unless Allowed by Statute
 
00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.649 align:start position:0%
amendments unless Allowed by Statute
and

00:23:57.649 --> 00:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you I can see why you're
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
you're saying you've got strong
 
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority I
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
happen to think the legislature has made
 
00:24:09.049 --> 00:24:09.059 align:start position:0%
a mistake in that case but you're
 
00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:10.700 align:start position:0%
relying on
 
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
authoritative sources for your actions
 
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:16.919 --> 00:24:18.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else yes Senator okay so I guess
 
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:23.940 align:start position:0%
I I'm a little confused so I understand
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
we we will allow it uh incorporation by
 
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
reference without an explicit document
 
00:24:33.169 --> 00:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
uh data document allow but only under
 
00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:35.700 align:start position:0%
conditions that where the we've already
 
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
approved it for certain agencies it
 
00:24:39.649 --> 00:24:39.659 align:start position:0%
sounds like we've done that for DOT and
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
DHHS we have not done it for the
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
Department you have done it for safety
 
00:24:46.909 --> 00:24:46.919 align:start position:0%
it's the statute specifically says that
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
they can adopt the revisions
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
that's correct it's just not in 541a
 
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
it's within the Department's own
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments
 
00:25:04.799 --> 00:25:08.690 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments
okay

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
nothing better is there a reason we
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
can't have a specific data document that
 
00:25:15.409 --> 00:25:15.419 align:start position:0%
just can be updated a fishing game comes
 
00:25:16.909 --> 00:25:16.919 align:start position:0%
every two years obviously to do their
 
00:25:18.409 --> 00:25:18.419 align:start position:0%
rules is there any reason you can't have
 
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
a specifically a specifically data
 
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
document reference so this doesn't
 
00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:22.970 align:start position:0%
document reference so this doesn't
happen

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
so my understanding thank you for your
 
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:25.610 align:start position:0%
so my understanding thank you for your
question

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know that it's impossible
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
um I unfortunately don't have Personnel
 
00:25:33.169 --> 00:25:33.179 align:start position:0%
from the state police here I was told
 
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
that everybody that was involved in uh
 
00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
working on this rule set is in training
 
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
uh today
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
um so I I could seek a more specific
 
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
answer for you but you know what I can
 
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
tell you is you know these
 
00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.310 align:start position:0%
tell you is you know these
um

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:51.169 --> 00:25:51.179 align:start position:0%
these regulations that we're
 
00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
incorporating by reference pertaining to
 
00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:54.919 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle
 
00:25:57.649 --> 00:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
Motor Carrier safety they're very
 
00:25:59.090 --> 00:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
important they have to do with Public
 
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
Safety and if the if the federal
 
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
government amends changes
 
00:26:06.049 --> 00:26:06.059 align:start position:0%
um you know interprets into published
 
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
Federal Register that the regulations
 
00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
ought to be interpreted a certain way
 
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
um it's really the most efficient and
 
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
protective of the public to like have
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
those changes just be effective in our
 
00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:19.740 align:start position:0%
rules immediately rather than to have to
 
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
go back every time the federal
 
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
government goes back to change any of
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
those regulations and I apologize I
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
can't speak more specifically without
 
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
Personnel from the division of State
 
00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:29.350 align:start position:0%
Personnel from the division of State
Police

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360 align:start position:0%

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
director Morrow
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure in this instance or with
 
00:26:36.529 --> 00:26:36.539 align:start position:0%
DOT but I know with Health and Human
 
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
Services the reason they have two
 
00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
exception is well one of them for
 
00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
example is a provider reimbursement
 
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
which is set by CMS and it changes
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
constantly so it simply could not be
 
00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
done through the current rule making
 
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.130 align:start position:0%
done through the current rule making
process

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
yes I'm not sure that the
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
the motor of a carrier safety rules are
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
liquid Dynamic thank you that's the word
 
00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:03.900 align:start position:0%
I was looking for
 
00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
okay representative lamb thank you my
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
question was actually some are similar
 
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
to that do you know how frequently these
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
these um Federal Regulations are updated
 
00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
so I
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
um I was able to speak with one person
 
00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:22.140 align:start position:0%
um yesterday afternoon about this so I
 
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't consider it to be like very
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
comprehensive but I to give you all the
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
information I had that person said that
 
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
there might be changes every three to
 
00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:33.539 align:start position:0%
four years
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
um I that was one person that I talked
 
00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:37.740 align:start position:0%
to I wouldn't consider it to be
 
00:27:39.649 --> 00:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
comprehensive but passing along what I
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
was told yesterday that's what he said
 
00:27:44.049 --> 00:27:44.059 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:49.559 align:start position:0%
thank you madam pure so it may well be
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
more efficient uh to do it this way and
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
indeed legal but I was the public and in
 
00:27:58.490 --> 00:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
indeed how's the agency supposed to know
 
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
when these changes occur uh because the
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
public is not monitoring uh the federal
 
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
government's actions so how are they
 
00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
going to be aware of the fact that the
 
00:28:12.769 --> 00:28:12.779 align:start position:0%
regulations have changed
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
um so I have two points in response to
 
00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
that and and I offer them as
 
00:28:18.529 --> 00:28:18.539 align:start position:0%
respectfully as possible I don't mean
 
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
any offense but
 
00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:24.380 align:start position:0%
um the the first is is that
 
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
these questions and answers are really
 
00:28:33.289 --> 00:28:33.299 align:start position:0%
more appropriate for a a a legislative
 
00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
committee session
 
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
um considering a bill to amend or repeal
 
00:28:42.169 --> 00:28:42.179 align:start position:0%
this statute today the Department's
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
position is is there a statute on the
 
00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:47.700 align:start position:0%
books that authorizes this activity and
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
there is and so we're asking that the
 
00:28:54.289 --> 00:28:54.299 align:start position:0%
committee approved the rules as long as
 
00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
the committee believes that the rules
 
00:28:58.909 --> 00:28:58.919 align:start position:0%
are in line with the statute
 
00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
um so you know whether the expression of
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
legislative intent and policy in the
 
00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
statute is something that folks feel
 
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
differently about today than they did
 
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
before is really more appropriate in
 
00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:11.570 align:start position:0%
before is really more appropriate in
session

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Lang a question with
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
director Moreau this isn't due till June
 
00:29:20.269 --> 00:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
could we he we gave him a question to
 
00:29:21.649 --> 00:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
come back for is there any reason we
 
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:22.980 align:start position:0%
can't postpone this let him come back
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
with the why they can't incorporate by
 
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
reference but not on our end I don't
 
00:29:30.529 --> 00:29:30.539 align:start position:0%
know if there would be an issue with the
 
00:29:33.289 --> 00:29:33.299 align:start position:0%
agency thank you
 
00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:37.640 align:start position:0%
thank you fine then I will suggest that
 
00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
barring objections we will
 
00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
move this to our next meeting
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
and ask the agency to come back with
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry which what what types of
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
dates do you want us to come back with
 
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
what date of these Federal rules are you
 
00:30:03.649 --> 00:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
incorporating and when were they last
 
00:30:03.659 --> 00:30:08.510 align:start position:0%
incorporating and when were they last
changed

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
is anyone else have any other thing
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
Madam chair we should have a vote on
 
00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
that Madam chair move the postpone uh
 
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:26.580 align:start position:0%

discussion those in favor
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
aye aye opposed
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%

00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:42.539 align:start position:0%

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:50.940 align:start position:0%
here okay so um the state police toll
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
list rules um the rules Implement a
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
statute that allows for the creation of
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
a rotating tow list for the State Police
 
00:31:00.649 --> 00:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
to use in the event that a State Trooper
 
00:31:03.169 --> 00:31:03.179 align:start position:0%
needs to have a vehicle towed the rules
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
are currently in effect as emergency
 
00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:08.220 align:start position:0%
rules and they expire on July 30th of
 
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
this year I spoke with the Department
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
yesterday a couple of times and um we we
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
went through my comments and um he also
 
00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
submitted a elite filed draft
 
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request which is
 
00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:26.220 align:start position:0%
linked on the website and you do have so
 
00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:28.860 align:start position:0%
um I went through that and it does
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
alleviate or does remove all of my
 
00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.350 align:start position:0%
alleviate or does remove all of my
concerns

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
we can still go through them if you want
 
00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
but we do need to have the committee to
 
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
First vote to accept the late filed item
 
00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
before we can you know move on okay
 
00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
I'll move that we accept the late file
 
00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:48.779 align:start position:0%
motion is there a second second
 
00:31:50.649 --> 00:31:50.659 align:start position:0%
and five
 
00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.630 align:start position:0%
those in favor
aye opposed

00:31:59.630 --> 00:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
okay now we're on the late filed uh
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request oh yeah um
 
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
so um I had some questions because some
 
00:32:09.409 --> 00:32:09.419 align:start position:0%
of the forms had indicated that they
 
00:32:12.649 --> 00:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
were revised in January of 2023 but they
 
00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:14.820 align:start position:0%
were brand new forms as it turns out
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
this is semantics the department
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
typically puts revised on all of their
 
00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
forms even if it's the first time
 
00:32:24.529 --> 00:32:24.539 align:start position:0%
they're doing a form so that kind of
 
00:32:27.049 --> 00:32:27.059 align:start position:0%
threw me off you know why is it revised
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
if it's a brand new form but um so that
 
00:32:33.769 --> 00:32:33.779 align:start position:0%
concern is is has been addressed some of
 
00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
the forms two of them required the
 
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
submission of a social security number
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't sure where the authority
 
00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:42.539 align:start position:0%
was for it but the agency is going to
 
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
remove that requirement on the
 
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
individual form and then on the business
 
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:49.740 align:start position:0%
form they're going to require the
 
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
federal tax ID number
 
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
so um I think that's okay so there's no
 
00:32:59.330 --> 00:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
ban on collecting tax IDs from
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
businesses not that I know of um but the
 
00:33:03.769 --> 00:33:03.779 align:start position:0%
department can probably talk about you
 
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
know why they're requiring it
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
um the other issues were around
 
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
um on page six of The Proposal it was um
 
00:33:18.169 --> 00:33:18.179 align:start position:0%
around some of the language where the
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
where the rule was using the word May
 
00:33:20.399 --> 00:33:22.070 align:start position:0%
where the rule was using the word May
and

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
um and it seemed to sort of you know it
 
00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:27.059 align:start position:0%
had some general criteria for when the
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
colonel would consider deciding whether
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
or not to impose discipline for
 
00:33:33.889 --> 00:33:33.899 align:start position:0%
violations of the statute but the use of
 
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
word may just kind of indicated that the
 
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
kernel may not take action and it wasn't
 
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:41.700 align:start position:0%
clear why or when that would take place
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
so um if you look there on the the draft
 
00:33:49.009 --> 00:33:49.019 align:start position:0%
conditional approval on page six they've
 
00:33:51.289 --> 00:33:51.299 align:start position:0%
changed some of that language and I
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
think it does a much better job of
 
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
laying out when that action would take
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
place and when it wouldn't
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
and then there was um on the next page
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
on page seven I had some concerns here
 
00:34:06.889 --> 00:34:06.899 align:start position:0%
because the rule said that a tow
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
business May appeal any disciplinary
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
action that has taken place meaning it
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
took place in the past so my concern was
 
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
having that discipline take place before
 
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
you know a hearing could possibly you
 
00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
know be problematic for due process but
 
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
um the statutes there that are cited in
 
00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
106 actually state that the being on the
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
toe list is a privilege and not a right
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
and discipline can take place prior to a
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
public hearing but they do have the
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
ability to request a hearing you know
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
after the fact so um those were the only
 
00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
issues that I had with the proposal
 
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
right Mr Hills thank you very much again
 
00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
Dave hiltz for the Department of Safety
 
00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:54.710 align:start position:0%
Dave hiltz for the Department of Safety
um

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
on the issue of the social security
 
00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.650 align:start position:0%
on the issue of the social security
number

00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:00.300 align:start position:0%
um it was we clearly had the authority
 
00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
to collect the social security number on
 
00:35:05.089 --> 00:35:05.099 align:start position:0%
a form that wasn't being commented on it
 
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
was a roster of all the operator tow
 
00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
truck operators that a business needed
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
to attach to their form the two forms
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
that there was a the question about one
 
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
was the individual application form so
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
basically everybody who was an operator
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
or an owner or manager or supervisor has
 
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.140 align:start position:0%
to fill out one of these individual
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
forms and we had the social security
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
number on that and arguably it is
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate if that form is filled out
 
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
by an operator but because if it could
 
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
get filled out by other people we just
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
decided to go without it on that form
 
00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
because we're getting the social
 
00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:42.300 align:start position:0%
security number authorized by statute on
 
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
the roster as to the business there was
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
no clear statutory authority to collect
 
00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
the social security number and as The
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
Madam chair had said there's no specific
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
prohibition on collecting a federal tax
 
00:35:59.690 --> 00:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
ID number for a business so to help I do
 
00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
have other folks here Captain Hagerty
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
and Lieutenant Lop here to chime in if
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
um I don't fully answer the question but
 
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding is the federal tax ID
 
00:36:11.089 --> 00:36:11.099 align:start position:0%
number would help to identify the
 
00:36:11.099 --> 00:36:11.829 align:start position:0%
number would help to identify the
business

00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:11.839 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
but otherwise we rectified the Social
 
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
Security Number issue on the authority
 
00:36:20.329 --> 00:36:20.339 align:start position:0%
um on the May versus shall
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
um again the comment was with the May it
 
00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
seemed like we had set up the rule in a
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
way that could contemplate that no
 
00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:29.700 align:start position:0%
action may arise even though a violation
 
00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:32.099 align:start position:0%
was found and so we did actually clarify
 
00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
the rule as you see in front of you to
 
00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
provide for that outcome that we
 
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
possibly could take no action again the
 
00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
folks here from the division can step in
 
00:36:43.849 --> 00:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
if there are other examples that they'd
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
like the committee to know about but one
 
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
would be if the division uh caught wind
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
of a a violation and when they looked
 
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
into it they found that it had already
 
00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:55.220 align:start position:0%
been rectified
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
and if the nature of it was minor then
 
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
they very well may not take any action
 
00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
so we decided to clarify the rule for
 
00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
that and then again on on the appeal
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
um you know just the way that we had had
 
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.410 align:start position:0%
um you know just the way that we had had
it

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
made it seem like there could have been
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
an ambiguity uh between the rule and
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
541a 30 Roman 3 for the uh
 
00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
immediate suspension and so we just
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
clarified it to make sure that everybody
 
00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
who read this rule knew that the way the
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
appeals were going to go were pursuant
 
00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
to the toe rule statutes 106 b-31 Roman
 
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
14 and 106 b34 so we hope that the
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
committee believes that we've clarified
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
the rules sufficiently
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
um thank you are there any questions
 
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
from the committee comments
 
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn no
 
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang moved to approve
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
um additionally approved 66 as presented
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
and amended
 
00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.109 align:start position:0%
and amended
second

00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%

comments questions I said one thing
 
00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
manager yes I want to thank the agency I
 
00:38:04.609 --> 00:38:04.619 align:start position:0%
had meetings with the Deputy
 
00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
Commissioner on this issue going back
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
trying to get these rules in place and
 
00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
you guys acted pretty quickly once I
 
00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
asked so thank you very much you're
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
by Senator Lang second by representative
 
00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
Lynn those in favor
 
00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
aye those opposed
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
all right the next one is at DHHS
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
um rule
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
2020 yeah 2022 160. it's on Telehealth
 
00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.089 align:start position:0%
2020 yeah 2022 160. it's on Telehealth
Services

00:38:37.089 --> 00:38:37.099 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
rules for the
 
00:38:45.359 --> 00:38:46.310 align:start position:0%
rules for the
um

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
for this area Telehealth Services
 
00:38:52.849 --> 00:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
um was actually effective in 2019 so gel
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
cart may have questions about how this
 
00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
process has been done since then and
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
then the only substantive comment is
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
down on page four of the rule and it's
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
really it's just maybe this is just me
 
00:39:08.089 --> 00:39:08.099 align:start position:0%
but the sentence just doesn't make any
 
00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
sense to me
 
00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:12.660 align:start position:0%
um and I think you guys have another one
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
to offer
 
00:39:16.849 --> 00:39:16.859 align:start position:0%
good morning Allison radney
 
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
administrator for the administrative
 
00:39:19.609 --> 00:39:19.619 align:start position:0%
rules unit for the Department of Health
 
00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:23.700 align:start position:0%
and Human Services with respect to the
 
00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
paragraph in D um in the unclear
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
um we would actually ask that we striped
 
00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
that it is actually pretty redundant to
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph a in that section
 
00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
um so we don't feel it's quite necessary
 
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
for it to be in there
 
00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
um I why I have a question why are you
 
00:39:47.089 --> 00:39:47.099 align:start position:0%
stating in the rule but people have to
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
follow the laws
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
I mean that
 
00:39:53.569 --> 00:39:53.579 align:start position:0%
I would think that would be assumed
 
00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
we do that in a lot of our rules we
 
00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
always I think every single rule the
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
department has we always imply that they
 
00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
have to comply with rules state law
 
00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
federal regulations
 
00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you
 
00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:09.380 align:start position:0%
all right anything else
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh just to address the first part about
 
00:40:13.849 --> 00:40:13.859 align:start position:0%
for the record Robert Berry uh general
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
counsel the division of Medicaid with
 
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:17.450 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
Services

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:17.460 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:20.460 align:start position:0%
um so when the law of that
 
00:40:23.329 --> 00:40:23.339 align:start position:0%
um passed that directed the department
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
to adopt rules for Telehealth was late
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
2019 as we all remember 2020 uh kovid
 
00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:32.220 align:start position:0%
became an issue
 
00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
um so the executive order that the
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
governor had issued uh executive order
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
number eight uh dealt with Telehealth
 
00:40:41.569 --> 00:40:41.579 align:start position:0%
services at that point when that expired
 
00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:44.820 align:start position:0%
the department was relying pretty
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
heavily on the statutory scheme the
 
00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
statute is pretty thorough as to
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
directing the department as to how to
 
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
administer Telehealth and it also has
 
00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
references to federal regulations in
 
00:40:59.450 --> 00:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
there as well so we felt that the uh the
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
statutory scheme and the Federal
 
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:02.220 align:start position:0%
Regulations were pretty sufficient at
 
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
emergency orders which I've
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
okay any questions comments
 
00:41:20.329 --> 00:41:20.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
okay moved by set Center to Lang second
 
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
by senator chandley
 
00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:31.140 align:start position:0%
discussion those in favor
 
00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:42.589 --> 00:41:42.599 align:start position:0%
uh the next item 2022 208
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
um the agency did submit a conditional
 
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
approval and additionally they submitted
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
an amended conditional approval and I
 
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
want to apologize in advance I just
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
noticed that's not posted online and I
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
have reached out to our administrative
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
staff back in the office to get that
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
posted as quickly as possible but the
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
only difference between the conditional
 
00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
approval and the amended condition of
 
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
approval is that the substantive comment
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
I had on page three of the rule text of
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
the conditional approval the agency did
 
00:42:13.609 --> 00:42:13.619 align:start position:0%
adjust that language to address that
 
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
comment so the only remaining comment I
 
00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:17.270 align:start position:0%
comment so the only remaining comment I
had

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
is on um
 
00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.130 align:start position:0%
is on um
page

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:22.140 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
I believe it's 20 22. thank you uh
 
00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
the agency with regard to definition of
 
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
relative uses or references the federal
 
00:42:37.849 --> 00:42:37.859 align:start position:0%
definition of relative as opposed to
 
00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:41.420 align:start position:0%
using the state definition of related
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
and when I had a conversation with the
 
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
agency about this they stated it's
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
because the federal definition does not
 
00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:52.140 align:start position:0%
include cousins Within
 
00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
what is considered a relative well the
 
00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
state statute of related refers or
 
00:42:59.809 --> 00:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
incorporates first and second cousins
 
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
and because of that the federal agency
 
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
with whom they work was saying that they
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
would not qualify for certain funds and
 
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
I'll certainly let the agency address
 
00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:11.220 align:start position:0%
that more directly
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
but that's the only remaining comment I
 
00:43:12.839 --> 00:43:14.329 align:start position:0%
but that's the only remaining comment I
had

00:43:14.329 --> 00:43:14.339 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Nicole valenzola rules
 
00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
coordinator excuse me for the Department
 
00:43:20.809 --> 00:43:20.819 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services
 
00:43:20.819 --> 00:43:21.910 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services
um

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
good morning Ben Hoffman I'm the
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
business systems analyst with the Bureau
 
00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:27.780 align:start position:0%
of Child Development and Head Start
 
00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:29.390 align:start position:0%
of Child Development and Head Start
collaboration

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
collaboration
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
um so on March 2nd 2022 the department
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
received a preliminary notice of
 
00:43:35.809 --> 00:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
non-compliance from the federal office
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
of child care so the majority of the
 
00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
edits to this rule in front of you were
 
00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:42.300 align:start position:0%
made to bring us into compliance with
 
00:43:43.609 --> 00:43:43.619 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Child Care scholarship
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
program which does utilize Federal ccdf
 
00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
which is child care and Development Fund
 
00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
dollars so one of the areas that the
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
department was cited was our definition
 
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
of related when it comes to child care
 
00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:55.790 align:start position:0%
of related when it comes to child care
providers

00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:56.329 align:start position:0%
providers
um

00:43:56.329 --> 00:43:56.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
so in RSA as attorney Rickard mentioned
 
00:44:01.849 --> 00:44:01.859 align:start position:0%
it means any of the following
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
Relationships by Blood marriage or
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
adoption parent grandparent brother
 
00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
sister step parent grandparents
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
stepbrother stepsister uncle aunt niece
 
00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
nephew first cousin or cousin the
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
federal office of child care in Federal
 
00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:15.780 align:start position:0%
Regulations defines relative for the
 
00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:17.220 align:start position:0%
purposes of child care providers as
 
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
Grandparents great grandparents siblings
 
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
if the siblings live in a separate
 
00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:24.839 align:start position:0%
residence from the child aunts or uncles
 
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
um so the department uses a child care
 
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
licensing unit to conduct monitoring
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
visits of child care providers to ensure
 
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:34.140 align:start position:0%
that they are in compliance with our
 
00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
health and safety rules relative
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
providers are exempt from monitoring
 
00:44:40.609 --> 00:44:40.619 align:start position:0%
visits so essentially we were exempting
 
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
cousins and these other relationships as
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
well perhaps siblings if they did live
 
00:44:47.569 --> 00:44:47.579 align:start position:0%
in the same unit as the um as the child
 
00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
where they shouldn't have been Exempted
 
00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:51.180 align:start position:0%
from the monitoring visits so that's
 
00:44:53.569 --> 00:44:53.579 align:start position:0%
what we were cited for we're looking to
 
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
align our definition with Federal
 
00:44:56.809 --> 00:44:56.819 align:start position:0%
Regulation so that we're not potentially
 
00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
fined or lose any ccdf dollars
 
00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:02.270 align:start position:0%
fined or lose any ccdf dollars
um

00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
this uh the edits in front of you were
 
00:45:06.109 --> 00:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the federal office of child
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
care they did indicate that these edits
 
00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:10.740 align:start position:0%
would bring us into compliance
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
um and unfortunately I don't believe
 
00:45:14.809 --> 00:45:14.819 align:start position:0%
that this is a simple
 
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
situation where we could propose a
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
legislative change to the stat
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
definition in statute because the
 
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
definition in statute is child daycare
 
00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
licensing and we're talking about
 
00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:25.140 align:start position:0%
license exempt providers here so I
 
00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:26.780 align:start position:0%
believe that child care licensing unit
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
may use the same definition in statute
 
00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
do I understand you correctly that the
 
00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:39.980 align:start position:0%
only difference is that the
 
00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:43.140 align:start position:0%
relative is does not get
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
visited for or inspected for compliance
 
00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
representative lamb um thank you madam
 
00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:54.770 align:start position:0%
representative lamb um thank you madam
chair

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
um is it my understanding that if this
 
00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
there's a sibling providing the care
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
that lives in the home then they're
 
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
inspected but if that sibling has a
 
00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
separate house they're not or am I
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
getting that backwards that's correct
 
00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:07.980 align:start position:0%
for federal regulations the Federal
 
00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
Regulation requires that the sibling
 
00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
live in a separate residence from the
 
00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:11.870 align:start position:0%
live in a separate residence from the
child

00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
that's great for our housing issues
 
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you indeed
 
00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:20.700 align:start position:0%
Rec Center is is there I know a lot of
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
our federal programs are state law and
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
what we've enacted is different than a
 
00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
federal law and we apply for federal
 
00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
waivers for a given program to because
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
of the conflict between state law have
 
00:46:31.849 --> 00:46:31.859 align:start position:0%
we done that here
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question uh we
 
00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:35.460 align:start position:0%
have been working directly with the feds
 
00:46:37.849 --> 00:46:37.859 align:start position:0%
and they suggested that we not cite this
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
anymore so I mean we've been in
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
communication with them and they haven't
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
indicated that was even an option they
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
said that we need to stop exempting
 
00:46:48.349 --> 00:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
cousins and and so forth from monitoring
 
00:46:48.359 --> 00:46:51.790 align:start position:0%
cousins and and so forth from monitoring
visits

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
representative lamb um thank you madam
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
chair given our housing situation and
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
child care situation is it appropriate
 
00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
to request a waiver so that these in
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
in-home siblings and cousins wouldn't be
 
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:07.380 align:start position:0%
subject to this uh these visits
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
I actually I think I need to make a
 
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
correction because relative
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
um sorry relative providers in the
 
00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
child's home are actually exempt that's
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
my fault
 
00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
so any relative provider who provides
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
care in the child's home is exempt from
 
00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
a monitoring visit that's sorry about
 
00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
that and a sibling of
 
00:47:26.809 --> 00:47:26.819 align:start position:0%
would be would be if they're in a
 
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
whether they're in the same home or in
 
00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:29.390 align:start position:0%
whether they're in the same home or in
different

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
right so it's actually it seems to just
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
be the cousins primarily that is the
 
00:47:34.319 --> 00:47:36.230 align:start position:0%
be the cousins primarily that is the
issue

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
anything ever director Morrow
 
00:47:47.329 --> 00:47:47.339 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd once again ask that
 
00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
anybody that testifies please fill out a
 
00:47:53.089 --> 00:47:53.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I'm going to make a motion
 
00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
to approve not reluctantly make the
 
00:47:59.210 --> 00:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
motion to approve but also ask the
 
00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:01.380 align:start position:0%
agency to try to
 
00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
submit a waiver and see what the feds
 
00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:06.230 align:start position:0%
submit a waiver and see what the feds
say

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:08.809 --> 00:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
and I apologize uh Senator is that
 
00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:10.740 align:start position:0%
approving the amended conditional
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
issue is that you don't know who else is
 
00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
using that statutory definition of
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
family or relatives you might instead
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
find out and if necessary correct
 
00:48:32.569 --> 00:48:32.579 align:start position:0%
and amend the statute
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
if you think that's important whichever
 
00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
you think would be more appropriate to
 
00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
the situation yes we can go back to
 
00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
child care licensing unit and discuss
 
00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
with them uh you know they specifically
 
00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
okay we have a motion to approve by
 
00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang is there a second
 
00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
second Senator chamley any comments
 
00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:58.970 align:start position:0%
second Senator chamley any comments
questions

00:48:58.970 --> 00:48:58.980 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none those in favor
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
aye a pool opposed
 
00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
all right your rule is approved and uh
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
all right the next one is the
 
00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:20.450 align:start position:0%
all right the next one is the
um

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
office of licensed Allied health
 
00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.010 align:start position:0%
office of licensed Allied health
professionals

00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
00:49:26.809 --> 00:49:26.819 align:start position:0%
um there's just a couple comments on
 
00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:28.460 align:start position:0%
here one
 
00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
RSA 328 F-15 gives the authority to ahp
 
00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:38.180 align:start position:0%
but 310
 
00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
a1d2h1 gives you authority to oplc
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
it seems like these should be in the PLC
 
00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
rules for oplc but I'm I'm just not sure
 
00:49:59.569 --> 00:49:59.579 align:start position:0%
the statutes are conflicted statutes are
 
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
currently in flux yes and as far as I
 
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
know the entire Allied Health
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
Professional Organization is being
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
repealed in House Bill too
 
00:50:09.359 --> 00:50:11.150 align:start position:0%
repealed in House Bill too
and

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
we hope that the oplc knows who's
 
00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
setting the fees where okay
 
00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
um so then the other issue is just um
 
00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
paragraph B underneath the fee table
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
um this is because it says all fees
 
00:50:29.809 --> 00:50:29.819 align:start position:0%
shall not be refundable but historically
 
00:50:29.819 --> 00:50:30.770 align:start position:0%
shall not be refundable but historically
um

00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
there are certain fees that
 
00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:36.839 align:start position:0%
are must be refundable so
 
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
um if you have an application fee
 
00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
that the agency has done something with
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
the application
 
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
um and so you can keep that fee but if
 
00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
you have a licensure like the
 
00:50:50.589 --> 00:50:50.599 align:start position:0%
application is leading to a licensure
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
the the and the agency doesn't give the
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
person their license for whatever reason
 
00:51:02.329 --> 00:51:02.339 align:start position:0%
denies the license then they can't keep
 
00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:05.460 align:start position:0%
that the funding they have to give the
 
00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:07.549 align:start position:0%
that the funding they have to give the
feedback

00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
feedback
 
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
um and that's just been
 
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:12.900 align:start position:0%
kind of historically how we function
 
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
with the fees so
 
00:51:16.849 --> 00:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
I wanted to bring that up and then
 
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
there's just a minor edit on the
 
00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:20.210 align:start position:0%
there's just a minor edit on the
appendix

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:20.220 align:start position:0%
appendix
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair members of the
 
00:51:26.329 --> 00:51:26.339 align:start position:0%
committee Lindsay Courtney executive
 
00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
director office of professional Ace
 
00:51:30.109 --> 00:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
insurance certification
 
00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
um I would ask that the committee
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
postpone consideration of
 
00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:37.940 align:start position:0%
um this final proposal The Proposal
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
conflicts with oplc's filing which is
 
00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
also on your agenda it's the offices
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
position that the board of Allied Health
 
00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
directors does not have fee setting
 
00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:51.300 align:start position:0%
Authority because of the conflicts that
 
00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
have existed in statute we have seen
 
00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:57.300 align:start position:0%
boards continue to file uh fees but I
 
00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
think assuming that the oplc proposed
 
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
1002s moves forward that would obviate
 
00:52:07.549 --> 00:52:07.559 align:start position:0%
the need for any filings by board so I
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
would request that the committee
 
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
postpone consideration and assuming 1002
 
00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:13.380 align:start position:0%
is adopted we would go back to the board
 
00:52:17.290 --> 00:52:17.300 align:start position:0%
and ask them to withdraw this proposal
 
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that this is redundant
 
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
to a proposal
 
00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:23.630 align:start position:0%
to a proposal
um

00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
we will consider in a bit and you want
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
to withdraw it
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
I don't have authority to withdraw it so
 
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
I would just ask that they can the
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
committee consider postponing this
 
00:52:37.309 --> 00:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
consideration and we would go back to
 
00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
the board that does have the authority
 
00:52:42.349 --> 00:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
and ask them to withdraw it
 
00:52:42.359 --> 00:52:43.730 align:start position:0%
and ask them to withdraw it
yeah

00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
okay we our deadline is not till late
 
00:52:49.849 --> 00:52:49.859 align:start position:0%
June so yes is there a postpone thank
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%

I won't be showing up with the next time

00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:23.940 align:start position:0%
all right this is uh 2022 230 it was
 
00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:25.430 align:start position:0%
all right this is uh 2022 230 it was
um

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
postponed from the last meeting
 
00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:29.329 align:start position:0%
postponed from the last meeting
and

00:53:29.329 --> 00:53:29.339 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:30.829 --> 00:53:30.839 align:start position:0%
um there is a conditional approval
 
00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
request the agency made changes based on
 
00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
public testimony from the the last
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
meeting and you can see those changes on
 
00:53:42.829 --> 00:53:42.839 align:start position:0%
the conditional approval request down on
 
00:53:42.839 --> 00:53:45.109 align:start position:0%
the conditional approval request down on
pages

00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
pages
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:56.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:58.910 --> 00:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
and I I
 
00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
there was public testimony on this but
 
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
from what I'm seeing I think that it is
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
in compliance with the Federal
 
00:54:06.359 --> 00:54:07.490 align:start position:0%
in compliance with the Federal
law

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:54:11.809 --> 00:54:11.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:13.500 align:start position:0%
good morning Allison radmay I'm
 
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
administrator for the ministry of rules
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
unit for Department of Health and Human
 
00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:19.069 align:start position:0%
unit for Department of Health and Human
Services

00:54:19.069 --> 00:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
Melissa Nemeth I'm the attorney for the
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Developmental services within
 
00:54:24.049 --> 00:54:24.059 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:27.380 align:start position:0%
Services and we do believe that the
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
changes that we have made in this
 
00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:31.220 align:start position:0%
conditional approval requests have
 
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
addressed the most of the testimony that
 
00:54:37.609 --> 00:54:37.619 align:start position:0%
was previously provided by the
 
00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
stakeholders there is one area and I
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
believe they are here ready to speak um
 
00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:43.740 align:start position:0%
and so I I'm not sure which order you
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
would like us to go in I I don't know if
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
you'd like to hear from them and then we
 
00:54:50.089 --> 00:54:50.099 align:start position:0%
can respond I know the general nature of
 
00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
some of their commentary and I'm ready
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
for them specifically okay so
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
um do you have any other comments that
 
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
you need us to know the only other thing
 
00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
that I think she may bring this up as
 
00:55:02.809 --> 00:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
well which was not in her other
 
00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:04.980 align:start position:0%
testimony she did point out to us this
 
00:55:08.049 --> 00:55:08.059 align:start position:0%
morning that on page 22
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
in 310.12
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
letter a number two the notice of the
 
00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
rights to appeal gives an individual the
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
right to appeal within five business
 
00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:19.130 align:start position:0%
right to appeal within five business
days

00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:19.140 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
however on page 20
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
in letter C five
 
00:55:27.049 --> 00:55:27.059 align:start position:0%
then notice that they are excuse me
 
00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
letter C six the the notice that they
 
00:55:30.829 --> 00:55:30.839 align:start position:0%
repealing gives them three days to
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
vacate the resident so she has pointed
 
00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:34.140 align:start position:0%
out that that is a conflict and that was
 
00:55:35.569 --> 00:55:35.579 align:start position:0%
an oversight on our part so we would
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
certainly be willing to change make the
 
00:55:41.089 --> 00:55:41.099 align:start position:0%
change on page 22 to allow that appeal
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
to be required to be filed within three
 
00:55:45.049 --> 00:55:45.059 align:start position:0%
days so that those two time frames are
 
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:50.569 --> 00:55:50.579 align:start position:0%
we will
 
00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
that could that be considered an
 
00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
editorial con corre correction since
 
00:55:58.370 --> 00:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
it's agreeing with the previous part
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
yes to be consistent with the other rule
 
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so we'll we'll take care
 
00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
of that thank you and then we can be
 
00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
ready to respond provide our feedback
 
00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
after you hear from the public okay Ms
 
00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:12.410 align:start position:0%
after you hear from the public okay Ms
Rosenberg

00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:19.549 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:56:19.549 --> 00:56:19.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
thank you I think something is
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
circulating that I prepared for you all
 
00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:25.559 align:start position:0%
my name is Karen Rosenberg I'm the
 
00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
policy director at the disability rights
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
Center where this dates protection and
 
00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
advocacy system for people with
 
00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
disabilities and I'm here to ask that
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
you enter a preliminary objection to
 
00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
these rules based on them being beyond
 
00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
the agency's authority and this is on
 
00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
behalf of the people of Developmental
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
Disabilities and brain injuries that are
 
00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
our constituents who receive home and
 
00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
community-based residential programs
 
00:56:53.089 --> 00:56:53.099 align:start position:0%
here's why the federal regulations that
 
00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
govern how Medicaid HCBS Home
 
00:56:59.210 --> 00:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
community-based Services may be spent
 
00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
require that individuals who benefit
 
00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
from these Services who are in
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
residential programs receive the same
 
00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
rights and protections that are
 
00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
available to tenants under the state's
 
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant law and that applies
 
00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether our landlord
 
00:57:19.849 --> 00:57:19.859 align:start position:0%
tenant law would apply to the situation
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
so in that document that I sent you kind
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
of summarizing our the Salient points
 
00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:28.740 align:start position:0%
here I've taken out and highlighted the
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation that applies in this
 
00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:31.849 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation that applies in this
instance

00:57:31.849 --> 00:57:31.859 align:start position:0%
instance
 
00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:35.220 align:start position:0%
so while the department did work with us
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
to address some concerns what was not
 
00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
addressed is the most important
 
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
distinction between what our state law
 
00:57:47.809 --> 00:57:47.819 align:start position:0%
protections require and what these rules
 
00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:51.180 align:start position:0%
would provide and what that is is due
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
process that is pre-deprivation under
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
our state landlord tenant law regardless
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
of the reason for eviction a tenant is
 
00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
entitled to Due Process a hearing before
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
an impartial judge to determine whether
 
00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
the landlord met their burden of proof
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
in the allegations that they made in the
 
00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
notice to terminate the tenancy and that
 
00:58:18.049 --> 00:58:18.059 align:start position:0%
occurs before the tenant is forced to
 
00:58:20.329 --> 00:58:20.339 align:start position:0%
leave their property
 
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
that is that is the most important
 
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
aspect of of due process in this case we
 
00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
don't deprive people of their property
 
00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:32.819 align:start position:0%
interest that is so important their home
 
00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:35.460 align:start position:0%
without providing the opportunity for
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
them to appear before a judge have
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
Discovery all of it and at that point if
 
00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
the court rules against the tenant they
 
00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
actually under our state law have a
 
00:58:48.049 --> 00:58:48.059 align:start position:0%
right to appeal to the New Hampshire
 
00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and during this entire
 
00:58:53.329 --> 00:58:53.339 align:start position:0%
time like I said regardless of the
 
00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
reason for the eviction that tenant
 
00:59:00.049 --> 00:59:00.059 align:start position:0%
remains housed the rules as proposed
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
carve out an exception for allegations
 
00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:05.940 align:start position:0%
that are based on tenant behavior that
 
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
allegedly causes substantial property
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
damage or harm to someone else
 
00:59:14.809 --> 00:59:14.819 align:start position:0%
now keep in mind that our our law says
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
we have we have untrained landlords they
 
00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:20.099 align:start position:0%
did not sign up to work with tenants who
 
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
may damage their property or harm people
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
yet a tenant can remain in their home
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
even if they lose and they follow all
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
the procedures for around 90 days after
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
that initial eviction action while vague
 
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
contests that action under the rules as
 
00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
proposed a resident would have to leave
 
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:38.940 align:start position:0%
in six days
 
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
they could appeal but what's the point
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
of that appeal if any Victory would be a
 
00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
peric victory because they would be
 
00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:47.579 align:start position:0%
unhoused at that time and we know how
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
hard it is to find housing in the state
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
and to come up with programs and another
 
00:59:55.069 --> 00:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
difference here is that with the
 
00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
programs that serve people with
 
00:59:58.849 --> 00:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities these are
 
01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:00.660 align:start position:0%
trained these are providers that hold
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
themselves out as experts they are
 
01:00:06.589 --> 01:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
trained experts who contract to provide
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
services to people with developmental
 
01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:11.700 align:start position:0%
disabilities and brain injuries who may
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
actually engage in behaviors that are
 
01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
challenging and they know that and
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
they're trained to deal with it they're
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
also paid a lot of money to do this so
 
01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
budgets I mean we see budgets I mean a
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollar budget is not a
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
big budget for someone who is getting
 
01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
for these kind of Residential Services
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
that's over eight thousand dollars a
 
01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
month at that level
 
01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
our private landlords are not
 
01:00:36.490 --> 01:00:36.500 align:start position:0%
are not receiving that kind of
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
remuneration and yet they actually have
 
01:00:42.349 --> 01:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
to comply with fundamental principles of
 
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
due process so for those reasons I think
 
01:00:47.809 --> 01:00:47.819 align:start position:0%
that these rules do not provide
 
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
comparable protections as our landlord
 
01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
tenant law does and that an objection
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
should be entered and I'm happy to
 
01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
01:00:59.450 --> 01:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm still trying to I apologize thank
 
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
you I'm still trying to follow the
 
01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:05.780 align:start position:0%
process here right and understand so
 
01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
there is that there is an under a 12 a
 
01:01:12.829 --> 01:01:12.839 align:start position:0%
number three
 
01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:16.140 align:start position:0%
right so if someone files an appeal they
 
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
get to remain in their residence or in
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
the notice requirement we tell them that
 
01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:20.940 align:start position:0%
they file an appeal they get to stay in
 
01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:23.220 align:start position:0%
their residence right is that correct so
 
01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
yeah and actually that's what that's
 
01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
what that chart shows you is so under
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
12a there's an ex there's an exclusion
 
01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
so you get they get one three-day notice
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
I think if you follow the chart that I
 
01:01:36.289 --> 01:01:36.299 align:start position:0%
provided that refers to the role it may
 
01:01:37.549 --> 01:01:37.559 align:start position:0%
be more helpful
 
01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
so you'll see on the right hand side of
 
01:01:42.589 --> 01:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
that chart it tells you the initial
 
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
notice that you get is a three-day note
 
01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:47.220 align:start position:0%
a 72-hour notice
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
after that then you get the set a second
 
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
notice three days to vacate
 
01:01:56.829 --> 01:01:56.839 align:start position:0%
you actually if if the reason for the
 
01:01:59.030 --> 01:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
termination of The Residency agreement
 
01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
under these rules is alleged behavior of
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
the tenant that is property damage or
 
01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
physical harm then
 
01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
you leave you can file an appeal
 
01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
you can stay for those three days but
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
after those three days you're done
 
01:02:21.049 --> 01:02:21.059 align:start position:0%
if you if the reason for eviction is
 
01:02:23.089 --> 01:02:23.099 align:start position:0%
something other than those
 
01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
two reasons then you can stay longer
 
01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:29.339 align:start position:0%
while you fight your appeal
 
01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
so if I understand you correctly the
 
01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:34.140 align:start position:0%
only people who are affected by this
 
01:02:35.410 --> 01:02:35.420 align:start position:0%
rule change
 
01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
as opposed to normal housing landlord
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
tenant laws are the people that are
 
01:02:44.569 --> 01:02:44.579 align:start position:0%
causing uh bodily harm and property
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
damage well the thing is we don't know
 
01:02:47.809 --> 01:02:47.819 align:start position:0%
if they're actually causing it like in
 
01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
our landlord tenant law there's an
 
01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:51.170 align:start position:0%
our landlord tenant law there's an
allegation

01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
allegation
 
01:02:53.809 --> 01:02:53.819 align:start position:0%
and we don't allow our landlords to
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
determine if their allegations are true
 
01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
we require a judge to determine if the
 
01:03:02.089 --> 01:03:02.099 align:start position:0%
landlord's allegations are true
 
01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
so similarly
 
01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
if there's an allegation that there's
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
property damage or harm we don't we
 
01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
shouldn't allow the trained provider
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
agency to be both the prosecutor and
 
01:03:15.359 --> 01:03:16.970 align:start position:0%
agency to be both the prosecutor and
judge

01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
judge
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:35.829 --> 01:03:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
good morning again for the record my
 
01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
name is Melissa Nemeth an attorney with
 
01:03:42.289 --> 01:03:42.299 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Developmental services at
 
01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
um and and the department
 
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
feels that this rule does meet the
 
01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:49.980 align:start position:0%
requirements of the Federal Regulation
 
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
in that the regulation says that the
 
01:03:55.549 --> 01:03:55.559 align:start position:0%
rights of the individual if the landlord
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
tenant laws do not apply which is the
 
01:03:58.370 --> 01:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
case in New Hampshire for this
 
01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
population that in these settings there
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
need to be protections and again that
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
address eviction processes and appeals
 
01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:08.700 align:start position:0%
comparable to those provided under the
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant law and so you
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
comparable does not mean 100 equal and
 
01:04:19.609 --> 01:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
equal as possible as in alignment with
 
01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
the landlord tenant law as possible with
 
01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
the exception of this one
 
01:04:28.849 --> 01:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
um cohort that Ms Rosenberg has
 
01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
testified to but unlike in landlord
 
01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:35.700 align:start position:0%
tenant law I'm looking now at page 20 of
 
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
our conditional approval request in
 
01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:40.140 align:start position:0%
letter c
 
01:04:43.609 --> 01:04:43.619 align:start position:0%
number four excuse me number four is
 
01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:47.220 align:start position:0%
where they would get the notice to that
 
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
there's an intention to terminate their
 
01:04:50.450 --> 01:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
residency agreement
 
01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:52.380 align:start position:0%
um within 72 hours based on their
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
behavior number five and this is a
 
01:04:56.329 --> 01:04:56.339 align:start position:0%
difference that something that does not
 
01:04:58.730 --> 01:04:58.740 align:start position:0%
exist in the landlord tenant law but we
 
01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:00.660 align:start position:0%
have added for this population is that
 
01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
in that case within 24 hours that
 
01:05:06.349 --> 01:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
individuals the the resident their
 
01:05:08.569 --> 01:05:08.579 align:start position:0%
service coordinator or their team has to
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
convene a team meeting in 24 hours to
 
01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
determine and take the appropriate
 
01:05:14.809 --> 01:05:14.819 align:start position:0%
course of action to ensure that they're
 
01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
going to have access to a safe
 
01:05:20.210 --> 01:05:20.220 align:start position:0%
alternative residence so the the
 
01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
intention here is that while they may
 
01:05:24.049 --> 01:05:24.059 align:start position:0%
not be staying in the same place that
 
01:05:25.609 --> 01:05:25.619 align:start position:0%
they were they're not going to be
 
01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
unhoused or rendered homeless and in the
 
01:05:30.170 --> 01:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
typical landlord tenant law that kind of
 
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
a resource is not available to the
 
01:05:35.569 --> 01:05:35.579 align:start position:0%
tenant another concern of the department
 
01:05:38.569 --> 01:05:38.579 align:start position:0%
is that not only you know we have these
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
the Federal Regulations this is One
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation that we need to
 
01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:43.260 align:start position:0%
comply with
 
01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
Additionally the we have the overall
 
01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility as a department to ensure
 
01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:49.980 align:start position:0%
that the rights of all of the
 
01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
individuals that are supported are being
 
01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
protected so in a case of of this nature
 
01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
it could be someone lives in a community
 
01:05:58.130 --> 01:05:58.140 align:start position:0%
residence with you know there could be
 
01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
six individuals living there and if
 
01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
their behavior is causing bodily harm to
 
01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
other individuals in that residence
 
01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
allowing them to stay there throughout
 
01:06:12.289 --> 01:06:12.299 align:start position:0%
an entire appeals process could put the
 
01:06:16.010 --> 01:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
other residents at risk and also put the
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
department and their providers at risk
 
01:06:19.849 --> 01:06:19.859 align:start position:0%
of not protecting the rights of those
 
01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
other individuals that live in the home
 
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
so there's a balance that has to be
 
01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
stricken here too with the department so
 
01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
we we do feel like the provisions we
 
01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:31.140 align:start position:0%
have provided are in compliance with the
 
01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:38.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:06:38.349 --> 01:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:41.569 --> 01:06:41.579 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so again walking through
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
this so there's a couple different so in
 
01:06:45.529 --> 01:06:45.539 align:start position:0%
a normal process they get a 90-day
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
notice and they get they get notified of
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
their rights and there's a meeting that
 
01:06:52.490 --> 01:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
occurs within 10 days upon notice of
 
01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
those rights of that they're being the
 
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
proposed eviction is going to happen in
 
01:06:58.970 --> 01:06:58.980 align:start position:0%
90 days however in the case of a
 
01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
resident where we have harm a potential
 
01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:03.049 align:start position:0%
resident where we have harm a potential
harm

01:07:03.049 --> 01:07:03.059 align:start position:0%
harm
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
um they're they're they don't get that
 
01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
90-day illness they only get a 72-hour
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
notice yes and in that 72-hour notice in
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
addition to getting that notice
 
01:07:16.609 --> 01:07:16.619 align:start position:0%
um you also for that for that CL for
 
01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
those uh residents they get
 
01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:21.900 align:start position:0%
um a meeting within 24 hours with their
 
01:07:24.049 --> 01:07:24.059 align:start position:0%
service coordinator or designee
 
01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
to convene a team meeting to see what to
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
do about this that's correct and the and
 
01:07:29.569 --> 01:07:29.579 align:start position:0%
the team needs to like take those
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate actions to make sure they
 
01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:34.140 align:start position:0%
have that access to the safe alternative
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
residence in the 90 days that's that
 
01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
meeting is to like talk about what is
 
01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
the transition plan going to be but the
 
01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
requirement here is if that notice
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
you've been notified you know there's an
 
01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
intent to have you leave in 72 hours
 
01:07:47.569 --> 01:07:47.579 align:start position:0%
we've got to get something done quickly
 
01:07:49.609 --> 01:07:49.619 align:start position:0%
and not only talk about a future
 
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
transition but what are we going to do
 
01:07:53.210 --> 01:07:53.220 align:start position:0%
right now to ensure someone has a safe
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
alternative follow-up so then if that's
 
01:07:59.210 --> 01:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
if that person in that 72-hour period or
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
their designee or service coordinator
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
files an appeal what happens so
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
um there's one other step so they get
 
01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
that 72-hour notice is their first
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
notice if they don't leave within that
 
01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
72 hours they get a additional notice
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
that is that they need to vacate within
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
three days and that's in number six so
 
01:08:22.490 --> 01:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
that provision applies that that second
 
01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:25.140 align:start position:0%
notice that actually says now it's now
 
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
you have to vacate that applies whether
 
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
your original notice was 90 days or 72
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
hours and it's that second three day
 
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
notice that can be appealed and then the
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
appeal provisions
 
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
for if anyone getting the 90-day notice
 
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
that says you would stay in your
 
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
residence but if you
 
01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
the allegation is your behavior you've
 
01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
gotten that notice because your behavior
 
01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
is dangerous then you don't have the
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
right to remain in your residence during
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
the pendency of the appeal
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
but the alternative is that your team
 
01:08:56.809 --> 01:08:56.819 align:start position:0%
has met and you at least you have a safe
 
01:08:58.970 --> 01:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
alternative residence to go to within
 
01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
that time frame
 
01:09:03.289 --> 01:09:03.299 align:start position:0%
I would certainly feel a lot better
 
01:09:07.090 --> 01:09:07.100 align:start position:0%
about this rule if it was explicit that
 
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
eviction cannot be you they can't be
 
01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
evicted because they're waiting for a
 
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
safe place or if their team can't find a
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
safe place I mean you I agree you need
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
to protect the other residents
 
01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.090 align:start position:0%
to protect the other residents
but

01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:26.169 align:start position:0%
but
um

01:09:26.169 --> 01:09:26.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
representative Hawkins Phillips so I'm
 
01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
sorry I have been out of practice now
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
for about a year and a half and I am
 
01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
struggling to remember
 
01:09:37.269 --> 01:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
there is an emergency
 
01:09:37.279 --> 01:09:38.510 align:start position:0%
there is an emergency
[Music]

01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:39.890 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:39.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
format to work outside of 540A to
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
expedite a hearing before a judge if
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
there is harm being caused on the
 
01:09:50.150 --> 01:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
property I'm struggling to remember the
 
01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
RSA number
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
um for
 
01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:54.229 align:start position:0%
um for
um

01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
for this purpose but um I think there is
 
01:09:59.450 --> 01:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
a way a tenant or a landlord can apply
 
01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
for a temporary injunction
 
01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
an expedite a quick 10-day hearing
 
01:10:07.610 --> 01:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
notice if there's some sort of
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
Harmony as to you shaking your hand head
 
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
um you don't think it applies
 
01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
um my my recollection is that there is
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
an alternative
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
um Avenue to expedite a hearing before a
 
01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
judge within a short shorter time period
 
01:10:23.149 --> 01:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
let me just say blankly that I'm feeling
 
01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
a little uncomfortable about moving
 
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
forward with this role because I it
 
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
seems like there is a major gap between
 
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
what the department is saying
 
01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
is providing accurate and full um
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
compliance with regulations and then
 
01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
also hearing from people who regularly
 
01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
are aware of tenants rights possibly
 
01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:51.169 align:start position:0%
are aware of tenants rights possibly
being

01:10:51.169 --> 01:10:51.179 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:10:51.179 --> 01:10:53.270 align:start position:0%
being
um

01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
being violated you know their due
 
01:10:57.410 --> 01:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
process being violated so
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
um with that thought I I just think
 
01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:01.430 align:start position:0%
um with that thought I I just think
um

01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know if there is this alternative
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
hearing process to expedite a hearing
 
01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
before a judge my question would be
 
01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
you know if that is given to regular 540
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
tenants why would that not also be
 
01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
extended to people who fall under this
 
01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:16.850 align:start position:0%
extended to people who fall under this
subcategory

01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
subcategory
 
01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:17.870 align:start position:0%
subcategory
um

01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
as a general statement I don't believe
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
that this group subgroup of folks who
 
01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
are being affected by this rule should
 
01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:27.659 align:start position:0%
have fewer due process rights than a
 
01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
regular tenant under who might fall
 
01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
under 540 that feels
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
um like the opposite of what the intent
 
01:11:35.330 --> 01:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
of the law
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
would be in my opinion
 
01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.630 align:start position:0%
would be in my opinion
so

01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm not sure where I'm going
 
01:11:42.290 --> 01:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
with that but I just I think that that's
 
01:11:44.689 --> 01:11:44.699 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that we're quite far away
 
01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
from being happy with with this rule is
 
01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:53.090 --> 01:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
so I
 
01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
thank you so the chairman had to leave
 
01:11:59.209 --> 01:11:59.219 align:start position:0%
so I'll take over so I guess the
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
the question comes you have 72 hours and
 
01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
72 hours these people that are at that
 
01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:05.460 align:start position:0%
put other people at risk or at least
 
01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:06.900 align:start position:0%
have been accused of putting other
 
01:12:09.169 --> 01:12:09.179 align:start position:0%
people at risk and at the end of those
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
272-hour periods what happens to them so
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
they would have a they would need to
 
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
move from that residence and their team
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
would have helped them locate a safe
 
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
alternative place to go
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
um to representative Maguire chairman
 
01:12:24.169 --> 01:12:24.179 align:start position:0%
McGuire's Point
 
01:12:26.270 --> 01:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
um we have language in there that they
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
determine and take the appropriate
 
01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
course of action and ensure that the
 
01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
residents has access to an alternative
 
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
safe residence that's where we've tried
 
01:12:36.649 --> 01:12:36.659 align:start position:0%
to make it clear I think she felt that
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
it wasn't as explicit as maybe it could
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
be that someone that this is what is
 
01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
required and they would this is where
 
01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:43.380 align:start position:0%
they would need to go and I you know
 
01:12:45.950 --> 01:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes as we as we all know there are
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
um housing you know it's difficult to
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
locate housing here sometimes it might
 
01:12:51.649 --> 01:12:51.659 align:start position:0%
be something on a temporary emergency
 
01:12:53.810 --> 01:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
basis um there I know there have been
 
01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:55.140 align:start position:0%
instances where
 
01:12:57.410 --> 01:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
this isn't ideal but someone might go to
 
01:12:59.209 --> 01:12:59.219 align:start position:0%
a hotel room they would have staff with
 
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
them the appropriate staff with them but
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
while something is located for them um
 
01:13:06.169 --> 01:13:06.179 align:start position:0%
so they're they would not be you know
 
01:13:08.689 --> 01:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
rendered homeless or put out on the
 
01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
street they would their something would
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
be found for them even if it's uh it
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
would be safe and appropriate although
 
01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
maybe less than their ideal ultimately
 
01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
where they would be going but there
 
01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
would some be something found for them
 
01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:21.900 align:start position:0%
in that interim time frame and if they
 
01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
don't find anything because given the
 
01:13:25.570 --> 01:13:25.580 align:start position:0%
housing situation right now what happens
 
01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
well I like I said I think this would be
 
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know it would it might be an
 
01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
emergency it might be a respite with
 
01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
someone with a family
 
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
the provider Network in New Hampshire
 
01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:41.460 align:start position:0%
you know independent of the housing
 
01:13:44.330 --> 01:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
bridge that we have for you know all
 
01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:45.649 align:start position:0%
bridge that we have for you know all
citizens

01:13:45.649 --> 01:13:45.659 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:47.699 align:start position:0%
there are certain providers that provide
 
01:13:49.610 --> 01:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
these services for these individuals so
 
01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
locating them you know there can be it
 
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
might take time to have someone move out
 
01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a domino effect sometimes
 
01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
one person has to move out for another
 
01:13:57.890 --> 01:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
person to move in
 
01:13:59.570 --> 01:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
um so I think that there would be that
 
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
these protections are there and in fact
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
these these things are there this
 
01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
happens now independent of whether we
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
we're adopting this rule or not would
 
01:14:11.090 --> 01:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
um in these situations now work is done
 
01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
to ensure and it can take a variety of
 
01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:16.669 align:start position:0%
to ensure and it can take a variety of
um

01:14:16.669 --> 01:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:18.290 --> 01:14:18.300 align:start position:0%
it can go in a bunch of different
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
scenarios but there is work done by all
 
01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
the providers to make sure that people
 
01:14:23.570 --> 01:14:23.580 align:start position:0%
are getting the supports that they need
 
01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
so on the department doesn't have
 
01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
concerns that there would be nothing
 
01:14:29.209 --> 01:14:29.219 align:start position:0%
found for someone and that they would be
 
01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:31.140 align:start position:0%
rendered homeless um but that the the
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
team that what we have in here has
 
01:14:35.330 --> 01:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
enough requirements for their team to
 
01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
find something for them
 
01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
further discussion uh representative
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
Lynn yeah I guess I'm just wondering the
 
01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
I mean it seems to me that that the
 
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
rules in us and do not take account of
 
01:14:51.410 --> 01:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
other avenues I mean I I assume that if
 
01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
in under four for example if a resident
 
01:14:57.709 --> 01:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
was posing serious threat of bodily harm
 
01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
or serious property damage
 
01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
if I think we have to be careful because
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
if we make the
 
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
if we make the the restrictions on the
 
01:15:11.450 --> 01:15:11.460 align:start position:0%
landlord so to speak or the the manager
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
of the of the thing too restrictive it
 
01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
would seemed to me in other words if if
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
I'm the if I'm the manager of this
 
01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
property and and there's a resident
 
01:15:23.630 --> 01:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
who's you know I can making ongoing
 
01:15:26.209 --> 01:15:26.219 align:start position:0%
threats to other residents or me or the
 
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
whoever and I don't have any ability to
 
01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
to remove the person in some reasonable
 
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
manner my alternative is to go to the is
 
01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
to go to the go to the courts or file a
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
com ask for you know the police to come
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
and arrest the person and get them
 
01:15:40.729 --> 01:15:40.739 align:start position:0%
involved in the criminal justice system
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
which may not be
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh may not be the best thing but but
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
presumably if they did do that the court
 
01:15:48.290 --> 01:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
the court might say in those
 
01:15:49.970 --> 01:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
circumstances you know I'm going to
 
01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
issue a bail order that says you can't
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
you can't associate with the place where
 
01:15:55.970 --> 01:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
you were living you have to go live
 
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
um which might not be what what uh what
 
01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
would be the most of most uh most
 
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing that that you know
 
01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:07.140 align:start position:0%
someone in this rosenberg's position
 
01:16:09.050 --> 01:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
would think is a good idea
 
01:16:11.209 --> 01:16:11.219 align:start position:0%
in in the department would you know that
 
01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
would not be something we want to happen
 
01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
but it can and does happen in in today's
 
01:16:17.810 --> 01:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
world in extreme circumstances I uh you
 
01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
know providers aren't jumping to that
 
01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
but sometimes the situation is does call
 
01:16:23.689 --> 01:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
um and and the other I think another
 
01:16:27.770 --> 01:16:27.780 align:start position:0%
risk here too and something again when I
 
01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
was talking before about balancing we do
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
have a limited provider Network and and
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
to your point representative and if the
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
providers don't feel like there is
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
recourse that they can take that might
 
01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:42.780 align:start position:0%
be reluctant to accept individuals and
 
01:16:44.689 --> 01:16:44.699 align:start position:0%
there could be a risk of you know I I
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
don't know the numbers that I can tell
 
01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
you but there could be a risk that
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
providers would decide that if these are
 
01:16:53.570 --> 01:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
the parameters then that might be not be
 
01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:54.900 align:start position:0%
a business noun that they would like to
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
go into because they don't want to be
 
01:16:59.090 --> 01:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
put in that situation where they have
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
someone acting in that manner and they
 
01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
don't have any recourse okay
 
01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:06.290 align:start position:0%
don't have any recourse okay
representative

01:17:06.290 --> 01:17:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so I I think the
 
01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:12.179 align:start position:0%
the word has not been spoken recently
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
but it was spoken by Miss Rosenberg uh
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
word is allegation uh so I I think
 
01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
that's the concern it's a balancing act
 
01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
we're all obviously seeing that
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
um that if you have an allegation of of
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
threat or harm or or uh or violation uh
 
01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
of someone else's rights including the
 
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
landlords uh then then the the potential
 
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
Hammer is
 
01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
they get yanked out after a couple of
 
01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
days on the basis of an allegation and I
 
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
think that underlying question is going
 
01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
what uh what modality is there in order
 
01:17:59.810 --> 01:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
to ascertain what the reality is whether
 
01:18:02.930 --> 01:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
the allegation is is based in reality in
 
01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
other words it is really happening that
 
01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
person is being uh the landlord or the
 
01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
other tenants are being threatened or
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
harmed or damage is being done and
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
that's a real situation then clearly all
 
01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
the other parties have a right to have
 
01:18:23.930 --> 01:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
that that harm stopped
 
01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:27.060 align:start position:0%
and have that person removed but the
 
01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
question is is the allegation
 
01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
substantiated or not and I think that's
 
01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
the point that Miss Rosenberg was was
 
01:18:37.610 --> 01:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
underlying uh making as her underlying
 
01:18:40.729 --> 01:18:40.739 align:start position:0%
argument so I mean it's obviously a very
 
01:18:42.649 --> 01:18:42.659 align:start position:0%
difficult situation with all the other
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
parameters are involved
 
01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
so I I'm troubled by the the situation
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
if there's no intervening authority to
 
01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
to examine the reality the situation to
 
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
establish that
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise a person is the tenant is
 
01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
potentially deprived and becoming
 
01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:04.310 align:start position:0%
potentially deprived and becoming
unhoused

01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
unhoused
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
all right represent Leon for a question
 
01:19:08.209 --> 01:19:08.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
um are these are these residential
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
housings for this community considered
 
01:19:14.689 --> 01:19:14.699 align:start position:0%
Health Care Facilities under our
 
01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
statutes they are they can be certified
 
01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
or licensed under uh it depends on the
 
01:19:21.770 --> 01:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
amount of residence that they have in
 
01:19:23.689 --> 01:19:23.699 align:start position:0%
them so if it's three or fewer they
 
01:19:25.610 --> 01:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
would be certified by the health
 
01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
facilities licensing of Health and Human
 
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
Services and if there are four or more
 
01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
they would additionally be licensed
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so this actually brings up
 
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:36.300 align:start position:0%
another sorry if I can have a follow-up
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
this brings up another conflict we have
 
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
um set up the library 58 which is
 
01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
talking about the warrantless arrest in
 
01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
healthcare facilities that may end up
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
being the what what could be used if
 
01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
somebody is causing potential bodily
 
01:19:51.290 --> 01:19:51.300 align:start position:0%
harm and there's allegations of it I
 
01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
don't know with the deadline of May 23rd
 
01:19:56.090 --> 01:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
and I know that I also need to go
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
somewhere so we have Quorum issues how
 
01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
technically we we handle this because
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
this this doesn't seem like it's quite
 
01:20:04.189 --> 01:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
ready but I know we're also bumping up
 
01:20:05.689 --> 01:20:05.699 align:start position:0%
on a deadline so I'm not sure what the
 
01:20:07.850 --> 01:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
right procedure is
 
01:20:10.189 --> 01:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
Dr Moreau if you wanna
 
01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
uh regarding the rule the committee
 
01:20:15.050 --> 01:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
could postpone
 
01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:16.310 align:start position:0%
could postpone
um

01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:19.010 --> 01:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to see
 
01:20:21.169 --> 01:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
they would need a waiver would need a
 
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
waiver by the committee uh from the
 
01:20:24.649 --> 01:20:24.659 align:start position:0%
committee would need a waiver from the
 
01:20:27.709 --> 01:20:27.719 align:start position:0%
director in order to postpone so before
 
01:20:30.169 --> 01:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
postponing I I want we in the beginning
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
of this whole hearing we started with an
 
01:20:34.250 --> 01:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
agreement on a change of some a date
 
01:20:36.050 --> 01:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
timeline where was that in the rule
 
01:20:38.689 --> 01:20:38.699 align:start position:0%
again I apologize
 
01:20:41.810 --> 01:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
that was on page 22.
 
01:20:43.630 --> 01:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
it's in
 
01:20:47.450 --> 01:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
310.12 letter a number two
 
01:20:50.450 --> 01:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
it was changing five business days to
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:02.209 --> 01:21:02.219 align:start position:0%
you know I wonder if you could tell I
 
01:21:03.649 --> 01:21:03.659 align:start position:0%
mean it sounds like this and it sounds
 
01:21:05.330 --> 01:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
like appropriately maybe this might we
 
01:21:06.770 --> 01:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
may end up postponing this but I'm
 
01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:08.090 align:start position:0%
may end up postponing this but I'm
wondering

01:21:08.090 --> 01:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
01:21:09.770 --> 01:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
um when you come back it would be
 
01:21:11.570 --> 01:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
helpful I think to all of us to know
 
01:21:14.330 --> 01:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
what our other states do what kind of
 
01:21:17.810 --> 01:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
regulations have they adopted for these
 
01:21:20.630 --> 01:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
situations in other words do they have
 
01:21:23.209 --> 01:21:23.219 align:start position:0%
do they have the sort of shortened time
 
01:21:23.219 --> 01:21:24.729 align:start position:0%
do they have the sort of shortened time
frame

01:21:24.729 --> 01:21:24.739 align:start position:0%
frame
 
01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
from a regular landlord tenant situation
 
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
that that you're proposing here and if
 
01:21:33.169 --> 01:21:33.179 align:start position:0%
you know if if you came back to us and
 
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
said you know this 23 states do
 
01:21:38.330 --> 01:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
something similar to this that's going
 
01:21:40.010 --> 01:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
to be pretty persuasive to me on the
 
01:21:42.770 --> 01:21:42.780 align:start position:0%
other hand if there's if there's uh if
 
01:21:44.330 --> 01:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
everybody if all the other states don't
 
01:21:46.189 --> 01:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
do something like this then that would
 
01:21:53.810 --> 01:21:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:55.490 --> 01:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
put that piece of information you'll be
 
01:21:58.610 --> 01:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
able to get if if we were way at Grant a
 
01:22:00.410 --> 01:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
waiver and postponents till next month
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
is that something you can bring
 
01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
um to us we can certainly look into that
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know how readily available that
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
information is um but it's something
 
01:22:11.570 --> 01:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
that the department could look into
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
sure I mean I just have some suggestion
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
I mean I assume you might call HHS you
 
01:22:17.450 --> 01:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
know the feds and just say look can you
 
01:22:18.770 --> 01:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
tell us what what do all the other
 
01:22:20.090 --> 01:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
states do and can you give us some
 
01:22:22.669 --> 01:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
examples and that they'll presumably
 
01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:29.330 --> 01:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
thank you so our our
 
01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
position we're in and Dr tomorrow
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong we can um
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
01:22:36.890 --> 01:22:36.900 align:start position:0%
this is a conditional approval a
 
01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request has been
 
01:22:39.649 --> 01:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
submitted so we can conditionally
 
01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:42.300 align:start position:0%
approve I I'm I'll be honest I'm feeling
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
a little better and I know that no one's
 
01:22:45.649 --> 01:22:45.659 align:start position:0%
going homeless in this situation and
 
01:22:47.209 --> 01:22:47.219 align:start position:0%
while it's being conditionally approved
 
01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
and going on that we're not going to be
 
01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
putting people out on the streets with
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
this they may have to go to a different
 
01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
place with this abbreviated timeline
 
01:22:57.530 --> 01:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
only as it relates to people who are
 
01:22:59.630 --> 01:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
putting other people at serious risk of
 
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
or property damage so I'm feeling better
 
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
about that piece but I would
 
01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
um so the questions do we conditionally
 
01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
approve this and let them know that it's
 
01:23:09.890 --> 01:23:09.900 align:start position:0%
not the final rule that they'll be
 
01:23:11.330 --> 01:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
coming back but it gives them a set of
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
rules to work on when do these expire or
 
01:23:18.649 --> 01:23:18.659 align:start position:0%
have they expired uh so the rules we
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
were working on these they weren't
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
expiring we were making these changes
 
01:23:24.350 --> 01:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
because we had to pour the federal
 
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
government to come into compliance with
 
01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
the Federal Regulations so I don't have
 
01:23:29.810 --> 01:23:29.820 align:start position:0%
that in front of me I don't know if I
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
don't think they're nearing any
 
01:23:32.450 --> 01:23:32.460 align:start position:0%
expiration date
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
so Dr tomorrow if we do a conditional
 
01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:35.820 align:start position:0%
approval what does that mean does that
 
01:23:36.890 --> 01:23:36.900 align:start position:0%
mean they have to come back with a final
 
01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:38.750 align:start position:0%
mean they have to come back with a final
proposal

01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
no it doesn't uh they have the final
 
01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
proposal they have the conditional
 
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
approval request if the committee
 
01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
approves the conditional approval
 
01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
request they have to file a conditional
 
01:23:51.709 --> 01:23:51.719 align:start position:0%
approval response the text of that has
 
01:23:54.050 --> 01:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
to be identical to their request it
 
01:23:56.689 --> 01:23:56.699 align:start position:0%
simply goes to our office we confirm
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
that the two documents the conditional
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
approval request and the response are
 
01:24:03.649 --> 01:24:03.659 align:start position:0%
identical and in that case they can go
 
01:24:05.209 --> 01:24:05.219 align:start position:0%
ahead and adopt the rule and then it
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
becomes a final approval in essence yes
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
and with an emotion to approve for
 
01:24:12.649 --> 01:24:12.659 align:start position:0%
conditionally improve the committee can
 
01:24:15.530 --> 01:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
also make recommendations or petitions
 
01:24:18.890 --> 01:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
or other requests of the agents
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
these rules were last effective in 2015
 
01:24:26.810 --> 01:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:29.689 --> 01:24:29.699 align:start position:0%
representative so I just wanted to
 
01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
comment that I think what we're talking
 
01:24:34.970 --> 01:24:34.980 align:start position:0%
about is the possessory interest of the
 
01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
of the unit and we're talking about
 
01:24:39.229 --> 01:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
people who are not regularly functioning
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
members of society but people who have
 
01:24:42.890 --> 01:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
brain injuries and you know are having
 
01:24:46.370 --> 01:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
real challenges in life so you know I'm
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
just thinking through my normal
 
01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
experiences of a landlord tenant law
 
01:24:52.010 --> 01:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
when there are instances of emergency
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
needs or substantial property damage or
 
01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
even harm being done to folks in their
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
uni you know adjacent units a six day
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
removal is a very quick timeline
 
01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
um even in normal circumstances I think
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
that you know without a hearing before
 
01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
judge it's not permissible so
 
01:25:14.689 --> 01:25:14.699 align:start position:0%
um I am very concerned about you know
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
asking people who are with brain
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
injuries to be removed from their home
 
01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
within six days and temporarily put
 
01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and I think that's what
 
01:25:26.450 --> 01:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
we're really talking about and we're you
 
01:25:28.130 --> 01:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
know you have to think through that who
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
is going to assist these folks moving
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
all of their personal property out of
 
01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
these spaces in this you know presumably
 
01:25:39.110 --> 01:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
time of Crisis for these folks so
 
01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
um you know when we're talking about you
 
01:25:43.970 --> 01:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
know this alternative service that might
 
01:25:46.729 --> 01:25:46.739 align:start position:0%
be able to help someone on day seven you
 
01:25:48.770 --> 01:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
know out of this possessory interest of
 
01:25:49.970 --> 01:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
their unit
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know that's a pretty big
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
pretty big deal this especially for
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
those folks you know who may not be of
 
01:26:00.050 --> 01:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
you know competency at the moment to
 
01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
really assess and grasp what's going on
 
01:26:04.129 --> 01:26:04.139 align:start position:0%
so they're going to be relying on other
 
01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
folks at the state or or where or these
 
01:26:09.709 --> 01:26:09.719 align:start position:0%
networks of you know support to help
 
01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
them through that crisis
 
01:26:13.850 --> 01:26:13.860 align:start position:0%
so I think we really do need to pause if
 
01:26:16.729 --> 01:26:16.739 align:start position:0%
there is no emergency to push this role
 
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
right now I think we really need to
 
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
assess the situation have a better grasp
 
01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
of what it is
 
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
um that process is going to look like so
 
01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
I I I'm not comfortable moving forward
 
01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
with the conditional approval at this
 
01:26:30.410 --> 01:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
time so I just remember we're not a
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
policy committee right so generally
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's not what we we step into we can
 
01:26:36.110 --> 01:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
give our recommendations We additionally
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
approve them said we want you to do this
 
01:26:39.169 --> 01:26:39.179 align:start position:0%
there's no obligation for them to do
 
01:26:41.470 --> 01:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
this but we're not a policy committee so
 
01:26:44.209 --> 01:26:44.219 align:start position:0%
doctor that's basically what I was going
 
01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
to say that the issue with the committee
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
is does the department have the
 
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
authority to do this is it consistent
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
with legislative intent
 
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
so we've already granted we've granted
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
in law waivers for them the normal
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant laws for this so it's
 
01:27:03.410 --> 01:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
definitely within their right to make
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
changes and to make these conditions so
 
01:27:07.610 --> 01:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:09.780 align:start position:0%
I just make a statement we can we can
 
01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:12.540 align:start position:0%
agree to wave and move on but uh you
 
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
know wave that wave the timelines make
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
them come back next month and see if
 
01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
they're willing to change the policy but
 
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
again I don't think there's any
 
01:27:20.930 --> 01:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
obligation for them to change the policy
 
01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
because what not a policy committee we
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
don't set policy here we just decide
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's within the law and
 
01:27:27.770 --> 01:27:27.780 align:start position:0%
within the intent of Law and
 
01:27:29.450 --> 01:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
constitutional and make a recommendation
 
01:27:33.250 --> 01:27:33.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
we do have the authority if if we
 
01:27:39.169 --> 01:27:39.179 align:start position:0%
if we do what what has been referred to
 
01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:42.060 align:start position:0%
as a waiver we can we can get ourselves
 
01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
we can get more time and ask them to
 
01:27:46.010 --> 01:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
give us to to give us some additional
 
01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:47.209 align:start position:0%
give us to to give us some additional
information

01:27:47.209 --> 01:27:47.219 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
yes the committee can postpone this to a
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
future meeting they will have to request
 
01:27:53.629 --> 01:27:53.639 align:start position:0%
from the director of legislative
 
01:27:57.310 --> 01:27:57.320 align:start position:0%
Services a waiver of the committee's own
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
45-day deadline to act like I'm I guess
 
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
I would be inclined to do that to do the
 
01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
waiver thing just because I I think I
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
mean I I really would like to know I I'm
 
01:28:11.209 --> 01:28:11.219 align:start position:0%
my inclination is that I I share many of
 
01:28:12.770 --> 01:28:12.780 align:start position:0%
the things you've already said but I
 
01:28:15.050 --> 01:28:15.060 align:start position:0%
would like to know what are others you
 
01:28:16.729 --> 01:28:16.739 align:start position:0%
know I'm not saying I expect some of you
 
01:28:18.350 --> 01:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
to come back and tell us you know here's
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
a list of all the 50 states and here's
 
01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
what they've done but if you could come
 
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
back and give us at least some
 
01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
information that says you know here are
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
what other states have generally done
 
01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
and if it's generally consistent with
 
01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
this that I think that's that's going to
 
01:28:31.850 --> 01:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
be good enough for me
 
01:28:34.250 --> 01:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
um but I but I do think we need to know
 
01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
something about that so representative
 
01:28:38.330 --> 01:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
is that a motion Grant the waiver and
 
01:28:40.129 --> 01:28:40.139 align:start position:0%
postponed next month and request the
 
01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
agency bring in data regarding what
 
01:28:44.209 --> 01:28:44.219 align:start position:0%
other states are doing yes that's what
 
01:28:45.649 --> 01:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
it is so that's the motion that's the
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
motion okay
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
and it's been seconded by representative
 
01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:50.570 align:start position:0%
and it's been seconded by representative
Schmidt

01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
Schmidt
 
01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
so the motion on the table is to Grant a
 
01:28:55.850 --> 01:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
waiver on timelines and to uh postponed
 
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
this until next month and have the
 
01:28:59.209 --> 01:28:59.219 align:start position:0%
agency bring in data about what's going
 
01:29:02.450 --> 01:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
on in other states right
 
01:29:03.950 --> 01:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
Dr tomorrow we're okay with that motion
 
01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:29:09.229 --> 01:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
any further discussion hearing none all
 
01:29:11.629 --> 01:29:11.639 align:start position:0%
those in favor say aye aye all opposed
 
01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
name yeah I just have it we'll see you
 
01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
next month ladies
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:18.239 --> 01:29:19.790 align:start position:0%
thank you
chair

01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
I just want to mention one
 
01:29:26.290 --> 01:29:26.300 align:start position:0%
one that uh just for the record earlier
 
01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh on I believe it was the Telehealth
 
01:29:32.570 --> 01:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
Services vote Senator gray seconded the
 
01:29:35.090 --> 01:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
motion I believe Senator uh
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire may have
 
01:29:39.410 --> 01:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
I second in the motion which I totally
 
01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:40.850 align:start position:0%
I second in the motion which I totally
did

01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:29:44.090 --> 01:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
in in spirit agree with but just for the
 
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
record it probably his best that it
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
reflected it was Senator Gray thank you
 
01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
so we'll move on to the next one I
 
01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
greatly apologize but I have another
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
meeting scheduled and I'm not sure if
 
01:29:58.729 --> 01:29:58.739 align:start position:0%
we'll have a quorum at that point
 
01:30:01.370 --> 01:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
uh uh let me just take a look at what we
 
01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:09.169 --> 01:30:09.179 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
share something back no I don't believe
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
so she's done yeah I believe so I don't
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
think she's coming back so Mr chairman
 
01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
yes if the committee uh needed to
 
01:30:22.129 --> 01:30:22.139 align:start position:0%
postpone because of the lack of Quorum
 
01:30:24.590 --> 01:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh the only other item that would
 
01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
require a waiver uh to avoid being
 
01:30:31.129 --> 01:30:31.139 align:start position:0%
automatically approved is the last item
 
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
from the Department of administrative
 
01:30:37.970 --> 01:30:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:39.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:30:39.490 --> 01:30:39.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
that would need a waiver so can you
 
01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
staple one more quick hearing and then
 
01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:46.550 align:start position:0%
staple one more quick hearing and then
we'll

01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
01:30:48.649 --> 01:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
Grant we'll do this one and then we'll
 
01:30:50.450 --> 01:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
postpone everything else yes all right
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
so if we jump to
 
01:30:53.570 --> 01:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
um the objection response for Department
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
administrative services and do that one
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
and I do promise this is gonna be very
 
01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
very quick because essentially what is
 
01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:01.669 align:start position:0%
very quick because essentially what is
um

01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:03.050 --> 01:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
happening at this point I know
 
01:31:04.610 --> 01:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection responses are
 
01:31:06.350 --> 01:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
fairly rare
 
01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:07.010 align:start position:0%
fairly rare
um

01:31:07.010 --> 01:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:09.540 align:start position:0%
and normally the only course is to
 
01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
either approve
 
01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:12.950 align:start position:0%
either approve
um

01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:16.610 --> 01:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
enter our final objection or uh
 
01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:17.810 align:start position:0%
enter our final objection or uh
to

01:31:17.810 --> 01:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:21.300 align:start position:0%
accept the response as written as
 
01:31:22.850 --> 01:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
addressing the issues however in this
 
01:31:25.390 --> 01:31:25.400 align:start position:0%
case there were still remaining issues
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
with the response I've had conversations
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
with the agency they want to fix these
 
01:31:32.689 --> 01:31:32.699 align:start position:0%
issues so there is one mechanism to do
 
01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
that and that is for a revised objection
 
01:31:37.490 --> 01:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
to be issued by the committee to allow
 
01:31:40.129 --> 01:31:40.139 align:start position:0%
the agency to do a revised objection
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
response in order to do that the agency
 
01:31:46.370 --> 01:31:46.380 align:start position:0%
has to request the revised objection and
 
01:31:48.350 --> 01:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
then it would have the same timelines as
 
01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
an objection response the agency would
 
01:31:52.729 --> 01:31:52.739 align:start position:0%
had 45 days to
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
submit it to our office and then the
 
01:31:57.709 --> 01:31:57.719 align:start position:0%
committee would have 50 days to act on
 
01:31:57.719 --> 01:32:01.070 align:start position:0%
committee would have 50 days to act on
it

01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%

Mr chairman yes I was mistaken about uh
 
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
what else would uh be automatically
 
01:33:32.050 --> 01:33:32.060 align:start position:0%
approved if it doesn't have a waiver
 
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
items m n and o on the regular agenda
 
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
will uh committee's deadline will be met
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
before the committee's next meeting so
 
01:33:45.050 --> 01:33:45.060 align:start position:0%
if in one motion you wanted to uh
 
01:33:46.970 --> 01:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
request a waiver from the director of
 
01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
legislative services for those three
 
01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%

01:33:53.810 --> 01:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
for is a motion that will do two things
 
01:33:56.930 --> 01:33:56.940 align:start position:0%
will uh Grant request a waiver for all
 
01:33:59.149 --> 01:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
timelines on the remaining items on the
 
01:34:00.410 --> 01:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
