okay folks i think we're ready to go
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
we have several of our bills which are
 
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
currently being heard down in senate
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
education at this moment
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
right now they're hearing the bill
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
dealing with um
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
the require request that we get the
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
statutory books here and annotated
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
versions at the beginning of the session
 
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
rather than at the end
 
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's uh that was started at nine
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
o'clock and at 9 15 senator khan is
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill that we submitted
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
on my behalf the granite state merger
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
with the unh system which of course came
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
out here unanimously was approved by
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
higher ed unanimously and and by all the
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
community college and university system
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
as well so there shouldn't be much of a
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
problem there but these are occurring at
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
the same time and linda's back now so we
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
can go ahead
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
i know that some of the other
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
departments around here are not too keen
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
about us asking for these uh hard copies
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
in the annotated version
 
00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:42.230 align:start position:0%
in the annotated version
yeah

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
oh yeah ols is not very happy about it
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
not very happy i i was hammered just
 
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
well they think the next thing we're
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
going to ask for is sticky notes that we
 
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
can put in the annotated version so it's
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
they say it's never going to end
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
alrighty so what we have today is we
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
have uh on
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
we have to close out all these bills one
 
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%

in the classroom committee further
discussion

00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes um thank you very much um
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
really i think the the concern that um
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
that we have on this that was aired
 
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
specifically by representative walls
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh several weeks ago
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
revolves around the um the
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
the base bill
 
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know as amended
 
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
on pay on page
 
00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.870 align:start position:0%
on pay on page
one

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
lines um
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
eight through ten
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
and where where there's a non-profit
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
corporation under rsa 292
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
so it i'm sorry not for prof not for
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
profit voluntary corporation under rsa
 
00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.190 align:start position:0%
profit voluntary corporation under rsa
292

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
292
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
that is that that becomes a organized
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
under the state as part of the state of
 
00:29:08.389 --> 00:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:29:08.399 --> 00:29:09.430 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
and

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
and at least the concern that was uh
 
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
that was expressed um
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
by representative walls
 
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
and uh and it actually came through i
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
think some correspondence
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
with um with with the bar association
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
um or with with other members of the bar
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
association that that
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
that it's not specific enough and and
 
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.070 align:start position:0%
that it's not specific enough and and
could

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919 align:start position:0%
could potentially breach sovereign
 
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
immunity and and other things that i'm
 
00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
really not
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
you know i really don't have the
 
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
background to speak with
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
but that would really be i think one
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
objection to um to the bill as it's um
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
as it's presented and amended and maybe
 
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
it's something that can be uh looked at
 
00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919 align:start position:0%
um more carefully in the uh in the
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
senate but um but unfortunately i don't
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
think we have any more um
 
00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
yeah we had discussed that
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative luno and the commissioner
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
of agriculture
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
sean jasper had taken this to the ag's
 
00:30:11.919 --> 00:30:13.029 align:start position:0%
sean jasper had taken this to the ag's
office

00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
and they reviewed that and they said
 
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
this is fine
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
however it probably will need a little
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
bit more look at
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a above and beyond this
 
00:30:23.039 --> 00:30:25.029 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a above and beyond this
committee

00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
from a policy perspective i don't see
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
any problem with it uh but i i i think
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
that what you bring up is a point that
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
will need to be looked at
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
down the road in the senate they don't
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
have anything to do so they can look at
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
that part of it
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
mr clerk
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
this is fine this one's fine
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
yeah did we have a motion i didn't
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.310 align:start position:0%
and hobson would that work
no

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
i made the motion i have that
 
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%

yeah
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
so um thank you mr chair the uh the base
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
bill and i'm i i am going to uh or or
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
representative ladd will introduce
 
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
amendment 923 which replaces the base
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
bill but uh there's uh there's elements
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the base bill that are that are very
 
00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.470 align:start position:0%
of the base bill that are that are very
important

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
for the uh from uh basically providing
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
over sound oversight relativity to the
 
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
accountability of uh of of um of public
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
schools in new hampshire and uh
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
and and uh i think it um
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
it was it was probably an oversight that
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
it was that it was repealed last year
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
during a sort of an omnibus um statutory
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
repeal and a lot of stuff did need to
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
get sweeped up but uh this wasn't one of
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
them and um and so it's uh i'm i'm glad
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative ladd is bringing this
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
back and um and and is about to
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
introduce an amendment
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
and you know i'll just echo exactly what
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative luna said each year
 
00:35:56.829 --> 00:35:56.839 align:start position:0%
uh or each
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
biennium uh there are there are omnibus
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
bills to come omnibus bills to come
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
forward with all the bills that we look
 
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
at the committees and commissions that
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
haven't been active and there's
 
00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.550 align:start position:0%
haven't been active and there's
recommendations

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
to get rid of them seeing we don't have
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
enough reps and to really get all these
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
things done or that really are
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
interested in in that task this was one
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
that was caught up a year ago in that
 
00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:20.630 align:start position:0%
that was caught up a year ago in that
bundle

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
bundle
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
and it really needs to continue so what
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
this is doing it's repealing the repeal
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
improvement and assessment oversight and
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
that deals with our statewide assessment
 
00:36:33.839 --> 00:36:34.950 align:start position:0%
that deals with our statewide assessment
program

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
and where the legislature looks at the
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
assessment and there's a process a time
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
frame in which the commissioner has to
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
bring back to us information regarding
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
that how we're doing on it and if
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
there's changes to be made it has to
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
come back through that oversight group
 
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
so it's not necessarily used every year
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
but it is necessary that we still have
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
it and that group is also was very
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
instrumental when we went through and we
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
approved the esser program
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
is the elementary secondary education
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
act the most recent version of it that
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
had to come to that committee as well
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
because we were dealing with assessment
 
00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.910 align:start position:0%
because we were dealing with assessment
so

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
we need to have this thing back in the
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
books and we've noticed it when we've
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
been trying to write legislation this
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
year even that it doesn't exist anymore
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get it back in the books
 
00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:29.190 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get it back in the books
simple

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
simple
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
simple task but we have modified that
 
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
and the amendment will
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
address that
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to introduce and and
 
00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.069 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to introduce and and
amendment

00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
0 9 2 3 h
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
um i'm not going to you know i've read
 
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
this but i prefer that if you would
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
speak to some of the changes we've done
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
reps in luno regarding committee
 
00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:10.150 align:start position:0%
reps in luno regarding committee
membership

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
membership
 
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
happy too um you know
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons some um
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
statutory committees don't meet as often
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
as they should
 
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
is sometimes due to how membership is
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
is applied on that that committee and so
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
what uh what we've done in the amendment
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
is to have five members of the house of
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
representatives appointed by the speaker
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
of the house
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
and one member of the senate appointed
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
by the senate president as opposed to
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
specific members coming from specific
 
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.589 align:start position:0%
specific members coming from specific
committees

00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:44.310 align:start position:0%
committees
and

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
and several members coming from the
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
senate we certainly all recognize that
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
that senators have have
 
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
a number of obligations outside of the
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
multiple committees that they already
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
serve on and um and getting to um
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
to uh work on statutory committees is
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes a real stretch for their for
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
their time so um
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
so we think this is a this is a better
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
organization for this and frankly um
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
allows the the five members um coming
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
from the house
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
to be representative obviously of the
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
composition of the political composition
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
of the house
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
and um and uh and i think puts the
 
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
speaker in a position where uh where
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
they can work with the um
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
the chair of um
 
00:39:31.109 --> 00:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
of you know let's say the education
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
committee to recommend who those five um
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
members would uh would be so i think
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
that's a good um good improvement and
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
then and then a little bit of structure
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of how the um the meeting gets
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh organized electing a chair
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
and then um and then the rest of it is
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh pretty much taken from the um the the
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
the earlier statute in terms of what the
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
what the authority is to review
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
provisions associated with the
 
00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
accountability and assessments under
 
00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.190 align:start position:0%
accountability and assessments under
193h

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
193h
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
and then uh
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
submitting a report legislative
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
oversight committee submitting a report
 
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh the commission will submit the submit
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
the report to the chairs of the house
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
and senate education committees so um so
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit of housekeeping on um on
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
that and uh and then i think also a nice
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
i think addition to this
 
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
is um is you know the sort of the
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
structure of the preamble here which did
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
not exist um in um in the in the earlier
 
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
version of this that really sort of lays
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
out the the the scope of um of why you
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
would have an oversight a legislative
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
oversight committee responsible for um
 
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
for looking at the accountability and
 
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
assessments of our public schools so um
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
i hope that um sort of sort of brings
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
people through what the amendment does
 
00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
and i hope you'd find
 
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
be favorable to supporting the amendment
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
i think that does uh it's very difficult
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
to get senate members on committees and
 
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
commissions at times
 
00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:07.910 align:start position:0%
commissions at times
and

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
this will put the bulk of the burden on
 
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
one other aspect of this bill is every
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
four years the statewide assessment
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
program must be reviewed
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
by the commissioner
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
and in the past reports have been
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
submitted to the education committee
 
00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
senate and house
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
without that we would you know not have
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
any input in terms of what we're using
 
00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
as an instrument to assess where we are
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
with adequacy
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
and achievement and growth
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
and i i they're they're i think by
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
having the legislature involved
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
is extremely important and so i
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely support uh reinstating the
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
oversight committee and the way it is i
 
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be a more effective
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
group with the membership leaning on the
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
reps and like us
 
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
i just have a question did section 1a
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
was was
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
did you change that or is that exactly
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.829 align:start position:0%
 
1a

00:42:14.829 --> 00:42:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
yes that's
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
that's like a purpose statement and um
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
reflects um
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
basically what what
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay we have a
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
um do we i i gotta wake up here do we
 
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
have a motion on that yeah we must
 
00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.470 align:start position:0%
have a motion on that yeah we must
yeah

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
and i made the motion on
 
00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.910 align:start position:0%
and i made the motion on
okay

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
so i think we're good uh reps and nelson
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
and vote
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
on the amendment all those case
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
we're on the amendment
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
i wasn't done asking questions i'm sorry
 
00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.470 align:start position:0%
i wasn't done asking questions i'm sorry
nice

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
nice
 
00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.750 align:start position:0%
nice
good

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
okay so now we have to look at the bill
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
hb 1236
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
the motion is ought to pass as amended
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
i have further questions it was still
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
questions on the amendment i was still
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
working on that
 
00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
but it says public
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
public elementary and secondary
 
00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.630 align:start position:0%
public elementary and secondary
education

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to work this out with
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
things that have been going on like
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
does this mean
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
that public schools must accept all
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
students or
 
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to work through the
 
00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.829 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to work through the
the

00:43:54.829 --> 00:43:54.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
ramifications of that paragraph
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
currently on our statewide assessment
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
program if you're in a charter school or
 
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
you're being tuition to a receiving
 
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
environment of some kind
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
the state is required if the student so
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
desires to take that assessment so the
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
state has the dollar
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
allocates that dollar every year for the
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
state assessment to be used by all
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
that's the assessment i'm talking about
 
00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.870 align:start position:0%
that's the assessment i'm talking about
schools

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
public elementary and secondary
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
education shall provide all students
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
and so what does that mean public
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
elementary and secondary education
 
00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
that's my first thing yeah yeah that's
 
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
exactly what it means it's fairly plain
 
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
language there it has nothing to do with
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
with um
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
you know what uh what
 
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
school a student
 
00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
goes to
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
it's basically referring to to public
 
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:56.079 align:start position:0%
elementary and secondary
 
00:44:56.079 --> 00:44:57.430 align:start position:0%
elementary and secondary
education

00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
um in new hampshire uh shall provide all
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
students with the opportunity to acquire
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
the knowledge and skills okay so it's
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
not talking about public schools it's
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
just talking about public education as
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
in education provided by public dollars
 
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
is that what that means
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to make sure i
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:17.190 align:start position:0%
understand it
okay

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%

discussion
 
00:47:12.069 --> 00:47:12.079 align:start position:0%
yes this bill has written was
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
very badly written
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
as you've heard me say before
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted on the record that the
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
title teacher's loyalty has to do with
 
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
the section in law and not my title
 
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
because there's been a lot of
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh emails etc that that we're trying to
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
say that teachers aren't loyal etc and
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with that that
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
happened to be the title of the section
 
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
that was already in law that was being
 
00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:40.390 align:start position:0%
that was already in law that was being
amended

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
amended
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
um i did come up with an amendment as i
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
promised i would
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
i it took a long time and discussion
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
with a lot of people both in in the
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
committee and outside of the committee
 
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
and it came in yesterday but the problem
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
is it is so different because like i
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
said i did not like it all the way the
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
bill was worded and it didn't express in
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
any way
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill the new amendment
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
expresses the bill very nicely but it is
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
so different you wouldn't recognize it
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
as being the same and so having a
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
discussion on that on the day we have to
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
have all of our bills exact
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
is uh unreasonable so
 
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
i decided the best thing to do is itl
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
the whole thing and bring it back next
 
00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.430 align:start position:0%
the whole thing and bring it back next
year

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:48:30.309 --> 00:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent cordelia
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
yes i think that this
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
bill started out
 
00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.630 align:start position:0%
bill started out
badly

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
badly
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons including
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
timing issues
 
00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.790 align:start position:0%
timing issues
timing

00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
timing
 
00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:45.030 align:start position:0%
timing
with

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
personal issues family issues
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor in trying to
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
get the proper language in
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
to drafting
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
for the bill
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
never had the opportunity to
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
revise that original
 
00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.710 align:start position:0%
revise that original
language

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
which caused quite a bit of
 
00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
i know there were repeated attempts and
 
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
discussions with people who testified on
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:19.430 align:start position:0%
the bill
to

00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
update it
 
00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:21.670 align:start position:0%
update it
but

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative lakers mentioned
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
that we've come to the point where we're
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
at a deadline and so i
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%

00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
currently 300 percent of the federal
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
same as the education freedom account
 
00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:38.390 align:start position:0%
same as the education freedom account
program

00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
too often i think
 
00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%
in government
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
programs we initiate
 
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
are aimed at
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
lower income
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
families but
 
00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.589 align:start position:0%
families but
ignore

00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
ignore
 
00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:53.720 align:start position:0%
middle income and lower middle income
 
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
families uh this bill
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
raises the family income cap from 300
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
we have heard um
 
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
from many people
 
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
in relation to the new education freedom
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
account program that
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
the problem they see with the program is
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
this is this program the tax credit
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
program is based on
 
00:54:26.549 --> 00:54:26.559 align:start position:0%
voluntary donations to the scholarship
 
00:54:26.559 --> 00:54:27.910 align:start position:0%
voluntary donations to the scholarship
program

00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
in return for tax credit
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
both from businesses or individuals
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
with a credit against the interest and
 
00:54:35.599 --> 00:54:36.710 align:start position:0%
with a credit against the interest and
dividends

00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
dividends
 
00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:38.799 align:start position:0%
tax that they might pay
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
and those
 
00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
have to be approved in advance by the
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
department of revenue administration
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
those credits
 
00:54:50.549 --> 00:54:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
legislation simply increases the uh
 
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
family uh income cap
 
00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:57.430 align:start position:0%
family uh income cap
um

00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
and i think uh after 10 years and
 
00:55:05.109 --> 00:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
you know what we've seen in terms of
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
the uh demand and the interest in
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
providing some
 
00:55:14.069 --> 00:55:14.079 align:start position:0%
relief and educational opportunities to
 
00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:16.799 align:start position:0%
lower middle-income families
 
00:55:19.109 --> 00:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
that this bill is needed
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:24.309 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
representative

00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair so my
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the tax credit
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship program actually works
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
within a
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
budget that is defined in statute is
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
that that's correct
 
00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:37.750 align:start position:0%
that that's correct
um

00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure about uh i can't remember a
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
budget specifically in statute i know
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
there are um the limit as terms of the
 
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
amount of tax credit that can be
 
00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:48.870 align:start position:0%
amount of tax credit that can be
obtained

00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
obtained
 
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
and so so unlike the um the education
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
freedom account program which operates
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
without any budget at all and is
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely a blank check
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
the tax credit scholarship program does
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
work within a budget so i guess
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
my my concern here or my question here
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
is that will
 
00:56:10.079 --> 00:56:11.829 align:start position:0%
is that will
will

00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
will students who come from families
 
00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
that earn less or equal to
 
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
income eligibility threshold of 300 of
 
00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
the federal poverty guideline be given
 
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
preference toward that toward that
 
00:56:29.359 --> 00:56:30.710 align:start position:0%
preference toward that toward that
finite

00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
finite
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
budgeted amount
 
00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
or might might some of these
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
students from lower income families
 
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
not receive a scholarship
 
00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:42.390 align:start position:0%
not receive a scholarship
yet

00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
a student that um that's from a family
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
of four let's say
 
00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
500 i think is approximately 132 000
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
a year um could they receive a
 
00:56:56.309 --> 00:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
scholarship over somebody that was uh
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
maybe from a much lower income
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
family or is there some sort of some
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:03.910 align:start position:0%
sort of
policy

00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
in statute that that gives preference to
 
00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
lower income
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh representative cordelli would you
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
like to respond to that thank you uh yes
 
00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
thank you um for bringing that up
 
00:57:14.549 --> 00:57:14.559 align:start position:0%
because i
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
neglected to talk about that um in my
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
previous remarks
 
00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.390 align:start position:0%
previous remarks
but

00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.990 align:start position:0%
but
this

00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
increase in the income
 
00:57:23.599 --> 00:57:24.549 align:start position:0%
increase in the income
cap

00:57:24.549 --> 00:57:24.559 align:start position:0%
cap
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
would only affect uh people if there was
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
a significant
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
increase in the
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
donations made to the program
 
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
i think right now the majority of people
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
in the program even though the cap is at
 
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
300 percent i believe the majority
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
or close to the majority
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
of families have an income cap um of 180
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
have an income of 185 or lower which is
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
the free and reduced
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
level so
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
this in effect
 
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
is uh setting the stage
 
00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
for the possibility of increased uh
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
donations to the scholarship fund
 
00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
because as of now um with the amount
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
that's been donated to the
 
00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund
 
00:58:13.589 --> 00:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
there is not money to provide
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
to families over the 300 percent income
 
00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
cap so um unless there is uh an increase
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
there will be no direct scholarship
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
impact to the increase to 500 percent
 
00:58:31.589 --> 00:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
i'm hopeful that um by doing this
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
make send a message to businesses let's
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
say that there are more people out there
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
who are interested
 
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
in these scholarship opportunities and
 
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
maybe spur um additional donations to
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
follow up on that
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
but um but given the fact that the the
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
tax credit
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
um is is set at a finance a finite
 
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
amount um
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
that that any
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh voluntary contributions from
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
businesses or or um
 
00:59:12.559 --> 00:59:13.349 align:start position:0%
businesses or or um
or

00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
or persons
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
towards the towards the program
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh over and above the budgeted amount
 
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
would would not qualify for tax credit
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
is that isn't that correct
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
i think in order for us to respond this
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
is one of the areas that represent
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
tanner's bill would have helped us out
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
77 g is not in our book
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of areas which are dealing
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
with education which are also dealt with
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
other areas like in finance and all that
 
00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
and so that's not in this annotated
 
00:59:47.589 --> 00:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
version whereas we've had it in the past
 
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
so it's one of the areas to cut out
 
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
that's why we do need to move forward
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
and get that
 
00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
done correctly
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
so it's you're going to have to find
 
00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:55.670 align:start position:0%
so it's you're going to have to find
that

00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
section if you're looking for it on your
 
00:59:58.870 --> 00:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
computer or your iphone
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
no i'm not i don't know
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
did represent cordelia you want to
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
are you looking that up right now um
 
01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.150 align:start position:0%
are you looking that up right now um
yeah

01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i could just state that as a
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
concern as well if if we um if we can't
 
01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
quickly find it i i uh my
 
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
my my concern is that um is that the um
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
that the amount that's raised through
 
01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:28.950 align:start position:0%
that the amount that's raised through
through

01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.630 align:start position:0%
through
contributions

01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
contributions
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
that qualify for for uh for a tax credit
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
is really where the uh is really where
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
the voluntary part you know sort of
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
comes to an end uh if um if if uh if if
 
01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
a person or a business wants to
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
contribute beyond that i think that
 
01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
could go towards what representative
 
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
cordelli is suggesting that that an
 
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
increase in voluntary contributions but
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
they would not necessarily
 
01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:57.430 align:start position:0%
they would not necessarily
be

01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
be receiving
 
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh the um the tax credit for those
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
contributions beyond what's laid out in
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:01:11.109 --> 01:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
thank you i will point out that we
 
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
talked uh or i mentioned briefly the
 
01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
free and reduced 185 percent um it is in
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
statute that at least 40 of the
 
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
scholarships have to be awarded to
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
people um at that income level or so
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
that that is not changing even if the
 
01:01:32.309 --> 01:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
top end cap is increasing um at least 40
 
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
percent of all scholarships have to go
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
to the 185 percent or lower families
 
01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
further discussion representation than
 
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
01:01:44.079 --> 01:01:45.190 align:start position:0%
yes um
the

01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:46.309 align:start position:0%
the
cap

01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
cap
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
the total cap in
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
legislation in law
 
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
is way higher
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
than the
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
amount that they've ever managed to get
 
01:01:59.029 --> 01:01:59.039 align:start position:0%
through donations so running out of that
 
01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
cap is not an issue
 
01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
in choosing which families because
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
there's limited money tends to be those
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
with most need so usually it is the very
 
01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
poor but occasionally
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
there's a student who is in a situation
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
in a public school
 
01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
who is extreme bullied
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
potentially special needs and bullied
 
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
because of that
 
01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:30.549 align:start position:0%
because of that
who

01:02:30.549 --> 01:02:30.559 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
whose family might make
 
01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:35.349 align:start position:0%
whose family might make
350

01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
350
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
you know rather than 300
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
but can't afford to put their kids still
 
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
because that's still not that much
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
can't afford to put their
 
01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:46.870 align:start position:0%
can't afford to put their
child

01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
into another a private school and they
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
can't find another public school for
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
them to go into
 
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
and so there are those occasions
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's rare but there are those
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
occasions where they do need to move a
 
01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:03.829 align:start position:0%
occasions where they do need to move a
kid

01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
under the children's scholarship fund to
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
get them out of a dangerous and very bad
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
situation and they need to move them and
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
they need to have the flexibility to do
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
that now hopefully
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
donations will pick up and hopefully
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
this will come to that point but one of
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
the things you have to realize with this
 
01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:25.039 align:start position:0%
percent it's the federal poverty
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
guidelines and everybody looks at it
 
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
like that's a lot but
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire poverty and federal
 
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:33.039 align:start position:0%
poverty are two different things because
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
remember the cost of living like along
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
this in the south is a fraction of the
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
cost of living here so think about what
 
01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
just a cheap one-room
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
room apartment is here
 
01:03:45.359 --> 01:03:46.549 align:start position:0%
room apartment is here
and

01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
and how much that costs so our cost of
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
living is considerably higher so basing
 
01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't accurately
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
describe what's actually going on in
 
01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
real life if you've tried to get an
 
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
apartment lately
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
um any place in the southern part of the
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
state it's extremely expensive
 
01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
and so you can be a family a lower
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
middle class family and barely make an
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
ends meet and then find that you have to
 
01:04:20.069 --> 01:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
move your kid because
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
that your kid is is not for whatever
 
01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
reason doing very badly in the local
 
01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:26.799 align:start position:0%
public school and you have to move your
 
01:04:26.799 --> 01:04:27.829 align:start position:0%
public school and you have to move your
kid

01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
kid
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
and you can't afford it because our cost
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
of living is so high so
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to point that out further
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
questions representative porter
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i'm really
 
01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:39.190 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i'm really
pulling

01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
pulling
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
back from memories from a couple of
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
years ago but originally when the tax
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
credit program
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
came in it only dealt with business
 
01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:48.069 align:start position:0%
came in it only dealt with business
taxes

01:04:48.069 --> 01:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
but several years ago and i remember
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
sitting volunteering on the ways and
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
means committee when it changed
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
it was allowed that interest and
 
01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:57.990 align:start position:0%
it was allowed that interest and
dividends

01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
dividends
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
taxes could also be reduced by
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
contributions to this fund
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
and that was the time when they did set
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
a maximum limit of how much could be
 
01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.470 align:start position:0%
a maximum limit of how much could be
credited

01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
credited
 
01:05:13.589 --> 01:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
what the top of the budget was
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
is this attempt here do you think
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli an effort to
 
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
now that the legislature has started to
 
01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.109 align:start position:0%
now that the legislature has started to
reduce

01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax with the goal
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
of getting rid of it all together a
 
01:05:27.599 --> 01:05:28.710 align:start position:0%
of getting rid of it all together a
whole

01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
batch of contributors will be eliminated
 
01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:34.839 align:start position:0%
so is this the goal of this to
 
01:05:34.839 --> 01:05:36.390 align:start position:0%
so is this the goal of this to
encourage

01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
encourage
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
other kinds of contributions and do you
 
01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:40.230 align:start position:0%
other kinds of contributions and do you
think

01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
i know the discussion was back then that
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
the businesses were contributing but not
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
to the degree that had been anticipated
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
which was one of the reasons why
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends was included so
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
are you hoping now that
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
that this will encourage other kinds of
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
contributions that aren't tax credit
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
contributions toward this fund
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
if i might
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
go ahead yeah um
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
i really hadn't thought of other
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
types of contributions to the program
 
01:06:14.069 --> 01:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
other than tax credits um but i do
 
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
recognize the uh phase out of the
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends attacks which
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
might have
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
an impact on the number of an amount of
 
01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.309 align:start position:0%
an impact on the number of an amount of
donations

01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
donations
 
01:06:24.319 --> 01:06:26.230 align:start position:0%
donations
um

01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
but i in terms of my hopes
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
um the hopes are that
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
more businesses
 
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
will become aware of the program and
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the program and
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
provide scholarships to needy children
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
i have a couple of
 
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
well a couple of comments a couple
 
01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:56.230 align:start position:0%
well a couple of comments a couple
questions

01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
first of all the median household income
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire for a family of four is
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
ninety seven thousand dollars and
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
uh a hundred and thirty thousand dollars
 
01:07:07.829 --> 01:07:07.839 align:start position:0%
which i believe is what we're talking
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
about puts people in the 80th percentile
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.270 align:start position:0%
 
top

01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
top
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
15 percent of the people in new
 
01:07:19.829 --> 01:07:19.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire as far as income is concerned
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
so just to get an idea of how this
 
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.390 align:start position:0%
so just to get an idea of how this
increases

01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
increases
 
01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
i'd like to ask that if somebody took a
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
education tax credit are they then
 
01:07:32.069 --> 01:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
eligible for an education freedom
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:37.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
and as a follow-up to that so they would
 
01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
get approximately five thousand dollars
 
01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
from that
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
and how much from the education tax
 
01:07:45.119 --> 01:07:47.589 align:start position:0%
and how much from the education tax
credit

01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:51.029 --> 01:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
uh when the tax credit scholarship um
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
program started
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:07:56.950 --> 01:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
average um
 
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
scholarship amount was i believe 2500
 
01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
um and it's in
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
increases with the consumer price index
 
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
annually so i'm not sure what the
 
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
maximum average scholarship is right now
 
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
so we're talking maybe
 
01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
between seven thousand and eight
 
01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for a person that
 
01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
qualifies for both
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
um that's that's possible i'm not sure
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
how many people um currently are
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
doing both you know maybe when
 
01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
the oversight
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
committee for the fa program
 
01:08:37.829 --> 01:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
meets again we will
 
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
be able to raise that question
 
01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
further further discussion yes
 
01:08:44.070 --> 01:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.630 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
um

01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
i have a follow-up to representative
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
tanner but that wasn't my initial intent
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
i'll just sort of speak a minute ago
 
01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
check it through my notes from our the
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
initial dialogue of this bill
 
01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
if i recall if my notes are accurate
 
01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
which they may be
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
it says they already have an extreme
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
waiting list
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
at the 300 level
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
and when we first started this bill
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
first thought the mission was for
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
low-income families
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
to help their students and help their
 
01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.070 align:start position:0%
to help their students and help their
children

01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:09:19.349 --> 01:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
so if we increase the scholarship level
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
to 500 we aren't even
 
01:09:21.679 --> 01:09:22.789 align:start position:0%
to 500 we aren't even
filling

01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
filling
 
01:09:22.799 --> 01:09:23.749 align:start position:0%
filling
the

01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
amount of scholarship need
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
as it exists right now at 300 percent
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
and i and i have the same concern that
 
01:09:30.239 --> 01:09:31.669 align:start position:0%
and i and i have the same concern that
that

01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
representative luna mentioned about
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen when more the
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
increase of level of the parental
 
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
guidelines for a financial
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
level at 500 percent
 
01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.950 align:start position:0%
level at 500 percent
particularly

01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
when we talked about the requirement of
 
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
i think glenn said forty percent for i
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
think those who use the quarterly forty
 
01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
percent uh for the 185 guy line so that
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
means sixty percent of the kids uh
 
01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:58.790 align:start position:0%
means sixty percent of the kids uh
currently

01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh are above that the one that 185 was
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
still below 300 and we have a waiting
 
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
list and i think that my number here
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
that i wrote down at the time was 600
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh when they had when they had the
 
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
testimony so my concern is
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
i have a i don't have a concern on
 
01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.270 align:start position:0%
i have a i don't have a concern on
scholarships

01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
scholarships
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
i think they're terrific i do have a
 
01:10:20.229 --> 01:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
concern the fact that we may be given
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
scholarship at the home the homeless
 
01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
schools are already there but that's a
 
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
different issue my concern is that this
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
was a program based on low income
 
01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:29.590 align:start position:0%
was a program based on low income
families

01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
and three percent or 500 is around 70 80
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
000 it makes it low income for a family
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
of four and now we're going to jack that
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
up to
 
01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
500 percent without any limit on uh the
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
the youngster's percentage so he's
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
servicing those people most needy we're
 
01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
not we're providing an option for those
 
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
who are in the next level and we have a
 
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
waiting list of folks who are already
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
low income which was the mission of this
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
account so um i i'm not i'm not going to
 
01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
support this moving up when we have 600
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
kids waiting at the 300 level i just see
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
it being filtered out to other
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
youngsters who were less than 80.
 
01:11:08.229 --> 01:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
further for the discussion
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
as it stands now
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
raising it to 500
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
won't make any difference whatsoever
 
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
there's not enough money
 
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
and they take the neediest kids first i
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
had a conversation
 
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
with the children's scholarship fund and
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
they specifically told me it won't make
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
any difference now because they don't
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
have enough money and it's not and it's
 
01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
not they're not limiting
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
to 40 percent the number of kids it's
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
not oh the law says 40 so we're doing 40
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
and the rest are higher no it's they're
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
they're taking the neediest ones first
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
uh representative cordelli had the
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
actual percent
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
it's well over 40 percent that are still
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
at that low income level but what it
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
does is it gives that option it does two
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
things one is it gives that option for
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
that one kid
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
like i said that one kid who they have
 
01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
to figure out what to do with who's in a
 
01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
bad situation who is in extreme need and
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
since they're rating on need
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
that would be an extreme need but the
 
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
other thing is it puts it for the future
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
if the if
 
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
the if the money does come in it gives
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
them those opportunities but they will
 
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
still take the neediest first and so
 
01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
even if we go all the way up to whatever
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
the maximum allowed is
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to take the neediest first
 
01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
they still may never get above the 300
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
depending upon what need and what kids
 
01:12:48.239 --> 01:12:49.189 align:start position:0%
depending upon what need and what kids
apply

01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
apply
 
01:12:49.199 --> 01:12:50.470 align:start position:0%
apply
so

01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
at any rate they told me it actually for
 
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
the moment except in that rare instance
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
won't make any difference anyways
 
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock thank you sir
 
01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
just to fall um represent legally i
 
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying but that's
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
exactly my concern that you're a lot
 
01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
they haven't met the need yet there's
 
01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
nothing in the statute that i see that
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
says they have to take the lowest income
 
01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
every time and nothing that says that
 
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
you're telling me that they they may or
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
they choose to except for this one
 
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
section with this one exception or this
 
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
one exception uh and then i see that
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
exception we have a in a large number of
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
rsas that allow for movement of
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
youngsters from one school to another
 
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
school that there is options there now
 
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
now that has nothing to do with the
 
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
finances of it that's a different option
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
for kids who may be in different
 
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
circumstances we have all those
 
01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
regulations that do that and we have a
 
01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
process for that i don't i can't i'm
 
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
concerned that using a single one
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
student identifying with these two
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
characteristics and then saying well
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
that one but that still moves if that
 
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
youngster is at the 500 level that there
 
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
are other youngsters at the 300 level
 
01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
that aren't being serviced by
 
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
the mission of this the goal of this was
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
for low income families and they're not
 
01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
they're not there's nothing in the law
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
that says they have to do it that way 40
 
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
so my concern is we're just adding to
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
the pile and there will be more
 
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
exceptional exception there i think
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
until we get to a level where all of the
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
youngsters who apply can be serviced we
 
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
don't need to increase the criteria
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chairmanland thank you the
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
aggregate total of tax credits that can
 
01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:29.830 align:start position:0%
aggregate total of tax credits that can
be

01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
issued regarding to our taxpayers is 5.1
 
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
and you can carry forward as a business
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
that's being that's
 
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
applied to your business profits tax or
 
01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
your enterprise tax the most they can
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
carry forward is one million dollars for
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
four year period of time then it goes
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
you then it is gone my question is do we
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
know what the aggregate number is that
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
we have been receiving from as a result
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
of this is it is it up to the max of 5.1
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
million or are we down somewhere around
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
three or so or two i don't know
 
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
according to the 2021 report
 
01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:11.750 align:start position:0%
according to the 2021 report
um

01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:16.669 --> 01:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
2.686 million dollars
 
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
right and uh
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
the percentage of students um eligible
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced price
 
01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:28.390 align:start position:0%

meals
 
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
was 68
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
thank you i i guess um and it's kind of
 
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
a follow-up to representative woodcock's
 
01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:43.910 align:start position:0%
a follow-up to representative woodcock's
um

01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh questions and comments is that
 
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
with this program and the reason the
 
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
program was come in
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
was the need that people needed money
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
because they without the money they
 
01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
didn't have
 
01:15:57.679 --> 01:15:58.790 align:start position:0%
didn't have
access

01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
access
 
01:15:58.800 --> 01:15:59.590 align:start position:0%
access
to

01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
educational options
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
the need that you're describing as the
 
01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
one student
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
is a need to have an option
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
but with a higher income
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
by definition don't have the need
 
01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
scholarship you know when when
 
01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
somebody's applying to college and they
 
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
want scholarships or they're trying to
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
get financial aid
 
01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
it's based on on
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
finance your financial situation
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
so the need should be
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
financial and not
 
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily the need
 
01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
over and above that of having an option
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
because these the people that have that
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
type of income
 
01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
have always had options and have those
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
options and
 
01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't stop them from going to a
 
01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
private school or doing tutors or
 
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
whatever they
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
would like to do
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
that's one comment i have and the other
 
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
comment i have is if it's not needed
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative cardelli
 
01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:11.110 align:start position:0%
representative cardelli
yes

01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
i i believe that this will send a
 
01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.110 align:start position:0%
i i believe that this will send a
message

01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
message
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
both to the
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
business community
 
01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.950 align:start position:0%
business community
that

01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
these scholarships are an opportunity
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
to help children and it's something they
 
01:17:30.719 --> 01:17:31.590 align:start position:0%
to help children and it's something they
should

01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
look more closely at
 
01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
i think that there can be
 
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:40.950 align:start position:0%
 
publicity

01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
publicity
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
awareness in the business community
 
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
about the program
 
01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.430 align:start position:0%
about the program
itself

01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
itself
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
so i think that this will help to
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
focus that attention
 
01:17:51.679 --> 01:17:53.030 align:start position:0%
focus that attention
um

01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:53.910 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
you know really
 
01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:56.550 align:start position:0%
you know really
tell

01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
tell
 
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
all families that uh
 
01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
we care about uh education and that um
 
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
you know we're doing our best to provide
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
for uh for all children um in the state
 
01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:10.709 align:start position:0%
for uh for all children um in the state
representative

01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
ellison and then representative
 
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair i i guess the
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
question is to
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
based on the the numbers that you gave
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
us about
 
01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
sort of last year and expenditures you
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
said 68
 
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
of the the students receiving assistance
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
were free
 
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
met that free and reduced price lunch
 
01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
185 percent is that am i correct
 
01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
are there other students who are
 
01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
applying for the program
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
who meet that criteria who did not get
 
01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:45.590 align:start position:0%
who meet that criteria who did not get
grants

01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
i i don't have that information but i
 
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
think that the
 
01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
intent is to provide for those uh lower
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
income students but i i don't have any
 
01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
hard numbers as to
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
maybe other students
 
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh just to add a little bit more to that
 
01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:04.070 align:start position:0%
uh just to add a little bit more to that
the

01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:04.790 align:start position:0%
the
the

01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
organization the business that's
 
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
contributing they can contribute uh 80
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
they get uh 85
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
of that contribution is that tax
 
01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:16.149 align:start position:0%
of that contribution is that tax
deduction

01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
deduction
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
if we have
 
01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
2.6 million dollars which we've heard
 
01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
there's capability of getting another
 
01:19:24.630 --> 01:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
2.5 million dollars which would if with
 
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
that money coming into this system
 
01:19:27.199 --> 01:19:28.070 align:start position:0%
that money coming into this system
and

01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
we're getting to that aggregate of 5.1
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
there's more opportunity for these
 
01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
children to have this opportunity the
 
01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
money would be there i think what
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative cortelli was speaking to
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:40.790 align:start position:0%
is that
um

01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.229 align:start position:0%
um
by

01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
if we can do some better marketing maybe
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
on this program
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh we can get more involvement so that
 
01:19:51.189 --> 01:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
we're able to help all those children
 
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
need this assistance
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
representatives and then follow the
 
01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
other i just wanted to respond that that
 
01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
one student
 
01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:01.990 align:start position:0%
one student
had

01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
financial needs because as i said
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
it costs more here than it does
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and it's based on national
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
numbers and sometimes
 
01:20:14.629 --> 01:20:14.639 align:start position:0%
i mean they're not going to give money
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
to a kid who doesn't need money
 
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
they're giving money to a kid who needs
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
money and it's proud don't assume it's
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
500 it might be 305.
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
i know i was hearing about one who was
 
01:20:30.629 --> 01:20:30.639 align:start position:0%
just over the 300 limit but the family
 
01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
didn't have the money and had an
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
immediate need
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
and are you going to tell a kid who's
 
01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
being bullied who's who's in who's
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
threatening to take his life
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
over it and has to get out of the school
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
that he has to stay there because his
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
parents make 305 percent of the limit or
 
01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
350 percent of the limit and his parents
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
can't put him in another school they
 
01:20:59.430 --> 01:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
don't have the money they don't have the
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
resources but i'm sorry you're over the
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
limit you got to go back to that school
 
01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:05.270 align:start position:0%
limit you got to go back to that school
where

01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
where you're making
 
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
any rate i don't even want to think
 
01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
woodcock and then we're going to have to
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
bring this discussion to us
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
i may have missed this during the
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
initial discussion i didn't write it
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
down i know it's either you or grandma
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
no is there uh rather than cordelia
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
is there a was there a balance left in
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
that account
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
last year at the end of the 2021 i i
 
01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0%
believe there was an amount carried
 
01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
forward about how much um
 
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh i think he said representative up
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
allowable a million but i just
 
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know what it was
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
well that that yeah the they're able to
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
keep credits that they haven't used for
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
four years okay
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
yeah the businesses okay right five
 
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
million right
 
01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:53.830 align:start position:0%
million right
okay

01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
in that particular account
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative cordelia
 
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
it was there a balance at the end of the
 
01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.790 align:start position:0%
it was there a balance at the end of the
year

01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:04.639 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying i'm just trying to weigh
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
we have all these youngsters
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
we have all these youngsters who
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
according to the when they made the
 
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
testimony did not get serviced
 
01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh waiting list
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm just trying to decide if they
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
zeroed out the account they still have
 
01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
money left they account
 
01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
i i i believe that they provide
 
01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
scholarships to the best of the their
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
ability based on the funding
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
do they have do they have money left in
 
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
the budget at the end of the year
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
oh we don't know that
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
refs and lucas
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
they get money in on a regular basis so
 
01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
they were zeroed out many times during
 
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
the year i don't actually know whether
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
they got money
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
right at the end and had some carryover
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
i know they would be zeroed out and then
 
01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
they'd put notice out to families to say
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
we got more money we can provide you
 
01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
some money now
 
01:22:56.629 --> 01:22:56.639 align:start position:0%
and um it's not unusual for money to
 
01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
come in at the end
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
so they they may well have had some at
 
01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
the end but that doesn't mean they had
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
it earlier
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman thank you
 
01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
thank you represent luna
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
sure thank you very much mr chair um i'm
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
really encouraged that uh that that
 
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
there's so many people that seem to um
 
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
recognize how important um spending um
 
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
5.1 million dollars
 
01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:21.830 align:start position:0%
5.1 million dollars
in

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
in what in tax credit dollars so you
 
01:23:26.709 --> 01:23:26.719 align:start position:0%
know without the state business profits
 
01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
tax we would not have this program so
 
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
clearly these are otherwise tax tax
 
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.030 align:start position:0%
clearly these are otherwise tax tax
dollars

01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
um and uh and 5.1 million dollars for
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
604 uh for students uh i'm aware that uh
 
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
that there's an effort in the senate to
 
01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:44.470 align:start position:0%
that there's an effort in the senate to
um

01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
to also provide
 
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
some some support for communities that
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
have higher numbers of students that
 
01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:54.639 align:start position:0%
come from low-income backgrounds
 
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
or or have low property valuations and
 
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
so i believe the senate has put 14
 
01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars for a program that
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
supports 160 000 students
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
so um so i i certainly hope as as this
 
01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
committee and as the legislature in
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
general looks to uh to get real in terms
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
of how the state funds its public
 
01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:20.639 align:start position:0%
schools that it will um it will look at
 
01:24:20.639 --> 01:24:21.990 align:start position:0%
schools that it will um it will look at
ratios

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
ratios
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
like what we're seeing here
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of the generosity from the
 
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
state in supporting students educational
 
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
needs and applying it beyond just 600
 
01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
kids and are probably applied to the 160
 
01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
000 kids that we have statewide thank
 
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
you but we need to be reminded that
 
01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
there's also the business bet
 
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
that this money is not state money the
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
credit is on the other side the coin and
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
remains with the business
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
and so it's not revenue comes into our
 
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
our general fund or trust fund any of
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
that so there is a a line there uh so
 
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
we're not subtracting from our our
 
01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
regular budget
 
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
no no rick
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
we are subtracting from the regular
 
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
budget because the tax credit is clearly
 
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
a subtraction from business profits or
 
01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax paid you pay you
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
pay whichever is greater your business
 
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
enterprise tax or your business profits
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
tax that's how it works in uh in new
 
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire and uh i'm actually a little
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
shocked to learn that with the tax
 
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
credit program you have a four-year
 
01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
carry forward where where where
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
businesses do not have any potential for
 
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
loss carry forward with business profits
 
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
taxes in new hampshire as they do in the
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
in the federal tax law so it's
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
surprising to me that but you know that
 
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
obviously the structure of the tax
 
01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:46.550 align:start position:0%
obviously the structure of the tax
credit

01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
credit
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
program goes beyond what we're what
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
we're debating this morning but uh but
 
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's it's very clear that
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
without our business
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
tax structure in new hampshire that this
 
01:26:01.110 --> 01:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
program would not exist at all
 
01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
last last discussion and then we're
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
going to move on
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
there are numerous people who give money
 
01:26:10.149 --> 01:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
and have given money to that program
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
myself included four years with no
 
01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
write-off whatsoever
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
number one and number two i have heard
 
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
businesses who give money to that who
 
01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
have said that is my money i choose
 
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
where that money goes and i could put it
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
into a different tax credit if i wanted
 
01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:29.590 align:start position:0%
into a different tax credit if i wanted
to

01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%

uh this is relative to rulemaking by the
 
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
state board of education for compliance
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
with federal provisions
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%

do we have any amendments on that one at
all

01:29:41.110 --> 01:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think so okay uh
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative hobson

made by representing hobson second by
 
01:29:59.350 --> 01:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
representative lekkis as otp on hb 1190.
 
01:30:01.110 --> 01:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh further discussion from the maker of
 
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
the motion
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
yes um so
 
01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
improper funding of state mandates in
 
01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire violates our new hampshire
 
01:30:11.189 --> 01:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
constitution under part first bill of
 
01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
rights article 28a
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
these programs become local taxpayer
 
01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities with only a rising
 
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
property tax bill to let
 
01:30:23.110 --> 01:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
constituents know that the programs even
 
01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:24.310 align:start position:0%
constituents know that the programs even
exist

01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
exist
 
01:30:25.990 --> 01:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
i think we can and should do better for
 
01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
our constituents let's hold the federal
 
01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
government to the same standards we hold
 
01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:33.350 align:start position:0%
government to the same standards we hold
ourselves

01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
this measure

does not oppose federal government but
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
does tell the state board they cannot
 
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
create rules where there is a lack of
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
federal funding similar bills have been
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
heard in the education committee and
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
this committee has also voted down
 
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
federal legislation that could not be
 
01:30:53.110 --> 01:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives
 
01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
as you hear from me all so often 28a
 
01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:00.229 align:start position:0%
as you hear from me all so often 28a
violation

01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
violation
 
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
this is what ends up happening we adopt
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
these federal we take this federal money
 
01:31:06.550 --> 01:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
we adopt these federal rules and the
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
schools end up having to pay for it
 
01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
without us providing the funding thank
 
01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:11.270 align:start position:0%
without us providing the funding thank
you

01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
rep san luna thank you very much mr
 
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
chair so um you know as we as we heard
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
the uh the the state does have to have
 
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
to comply with uh with federal laws
 
01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
and uh and just saying that while we
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
refuse to do rules to comply with
 
01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:32.719 align:start position:0%
federal laws only will put us in
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
non-compliance with federal laws which
 
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
have other strings attacks attached to
 
01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
it like like potentially idea funds like
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
like potentially title one dollars like
 
01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
potentially federal highway dollars so
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
all i can tell
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
is uh for the best of it this is a
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
feel-good bill uh at best
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
for um
 
01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh for the people who are who are the
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
proponents of this but um but at worst
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh this could potentially force the
 
01:32:04.629 --> 01:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
department of education to uh to
 
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
dismantle special education laws uh that
 
01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
are consistent with uh with uh with
 
01:32:13.189 --> 01:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
federal requirements and uh and could
 
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
could potentially have devastating
 
01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
effects at least on the the rules that
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
um that are that are uh uh developed by
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
the uh by the department uh but uh you
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
know uh that said that will not
 
01:32:31.110 --> 01:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
for a second change new hampshire's
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
obligation to um uh to meet uh and to
 
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
perform against the uh
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
uh the requirements that uh that that
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
come to us through the uh the us
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
department of of education
 
01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
and um and so you know i really i
 
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
th this this bill
 
01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
really doesn't accomplish anything that
 
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
that i think the sponsors um
 
01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:56.629 align:start position:0%
that i think the sponsors um
um

01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
intend to to happen but could certainly
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
have um have uh ill effects
 
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
um particularly uh on our special
 
01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:07.189 align:start position:0%
um particularly uh on our special
education

01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
student population thank you
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
yes represent hobson
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
yes i just wanted to simply point out
 
01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:17.189 align:start position:0%
yes i just wanted to simply point out
that

01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:19.110 --> 01:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
for instance the bill that we heard
 
01:33:23.669 --> 01:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
about the national school lunch program
 
01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
it was basically coming down to
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
instituting an entire program and
 
01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:29.669 align:start position:0%
instituting an entire program and
infrastructure

01:33:29.669 --> 01:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
positions to oversee this program for 30
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
schools that
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
had not already implemented their own
 
01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
breakfast program
 
01:33:40.719 --> 01:33:41.910 align:start position:0%
breakfast program
so

01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's fine to get grant money to
 
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
establish the program but it's incumbent
 
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
on the taxpayers to keep the program
 
01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
going and they don't even know that this
 
01:33:53.189 --> 01:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
is happening and that's the reason for
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
this bill we need to be more responsible
 
01:33:58.149 --> 01:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
to taxpayers
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%

memory refreshed does anybody know
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
what percentage of the employees at the

department of education
 
01:34:14.229 --> 01:34:14.239 align:start position:0%
are funded by federal funds somewhere
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
around 80 85 percent
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's about 200

president woodcock
 
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you i just wanted to clarify a
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
fact that we dealt uh the representative
 
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
hudson uh may have mistakenly uh
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
said i knew she wouldn't do it on
 
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
purpose uh
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
the 30 schools
 
01:34:37.110 --> 01:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
i'm talking back to the breakfast lunch
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
programs you just mentioned the one that
 
01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
was cost 40 cents a day for a student
 
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
have a breakfast and lunch if they're on
 
01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
a free reducing that program um
 
01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
the 30 schools
 
01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
were not 30 schools that
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
currently uh are regulated the 30 school
 
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
number that you hear from does uh 30
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
schools that currently do not uh
 
01:34:57.199 --> 01:34:58.709 align:start position:0%
schools that currently do not uh
participate

01:34:58.709 --> 01:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
participate
 
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
in the coe program with the federal
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
funding so they don't know uh which 30
 
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
schools they that who participate
 
01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
because they open this bank so it
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't cost those 30 schools anything
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
because they aren't in the program and
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't do that that's where that
 
01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
30 number comes from uh there are some
 
01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
schools however that that you i think
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
you're alluding to that take you just
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
only breakfast at lunch and don't do
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
breakfast which would be the cost it
 
01:35:25.830 --> 01:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't those thirty those thirty are all
 
01:35:28.709 --> 01:35:28.719 align:start position:0%

01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
i fully support
 
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
representative lou knows comments that
 
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
this is going to hurt the disabilities
 
01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
people in the state of new hampshire
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
has that potential but i'd also like to
 
01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
point out that the hypocrisy
 
01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
of 28a and also the little l that's put
 
01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
on our
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
bills speaking for local financial
 
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
impact and also our constant use of
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
local control
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
when it's
 
01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
advantageous to us and so is 28a used
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
there are so many things that are
 
01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
put into law in the state of new
 
01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.430 align:start position:0%
put into law in the state of new
hampshire

01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:16.229 align:start position:0%
hampshire
that

01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
do not have the funding
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
with them
 
01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:20.629 align:start position:0%
with them
and

01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
we do so because there's a need or
 
01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
because we feel that it's important and
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
the state can support it so
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
i just think again this is just a
 
01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
feel-good bill thanks

agree
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
we need to be responsible
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
for everything that we implement in the
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%

01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to be passing around an
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:31.750 --> 01:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
okay so we have several amendments here
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
on this bill 1513.
 
01:54:36.870 --> 01:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
there's one that's zero nine nine three
 
01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
h uh that's just a one liner that's
 
01:54:42.070 --> 01:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
changing the effective date of the bill
 
01:54:45.189 --> 01:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
to july one two thousand twenty three
 
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
the other amendment is zero three zero
 
01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
seven h
 
01:54:51.910 --> 01:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
and this is the bill where we're dealing
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
with special ed education where we have
 
01:54:56.229 --> 01:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
the age 21
 
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
and we were looking at inclusive through
 
01:54:58.480 --> 01:54:59.270 align:start position:0%
and we were looking at inclusive through
the

01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
age 21 before they lose all the services
 
01:55:03.510 --> 01:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
so they turn
 
01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
21 halfway through the school year it's
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
the pro the child ends up having to
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
either you know there's no more funding
 
01:55:12.870 --> 01:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
or else we'll have the funding continue
 
01:55:15.189 --> 01:55:15.199 align:start position:0%
through the end of the year
 
01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
so um let's have a little bit of
 
01:55:19.510 --> 01:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
discussion first on these two two bills
 
01:55:22.070 --> 01:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
and see if it's um
 
01:55:24.390 --> 01:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
it looks like
 
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
the effective date on the zero three
 
01:55:30.149 --> 01:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
zero seven h is the same date as
 
01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
as um as that amendment
 
01:55:36.149 --> 01:55:36.159 align:start position:0%
so let's look at uh zero three zero
 
01:55:38.310 --> 01:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
seven h uh not with a motion on the
 
01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
floor let's talk about it and see where
 
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:55:43.030 --> 01:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
reblad do you happen to have any extra
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
copies of that amendment
 
01:55:47.589 --> 01:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
are there any anywhere 307 you're
 
01:55:49.990 --> 01:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:35.189 --> 01:56:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:35.199 --> 01:56:44.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:51.669 --> 01:56:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
which amendment are you starting with
 
01:56:55.270 --> 01:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
she's going to make some copies now for
 
01:56:55.280 --> 01:57:02.709 align:start position:0%
she's going to make some copies now for
everybody

01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:06.070 --> 01:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
okay we can go ahead with the
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
with the discussion yes
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
on on three zero seven uh discussion
 
01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:13.679 align:start position:0%
represent uh mullen do you wanna go
 
01:57:16.070 --> 01:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
ahead please i would be happy to thank
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
you uh mr chairman so
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
this bill in uh when it came to us
 
01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
originally was uh to change the
 
01:57:28.070 --> 01:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
definition of who
 
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
a child eligible for services what the
 
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
age parameters are
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
the original bill went with the federal
 
01:57:37.189 --> 01:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
definition of child with a disability
 
01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
being defined as a child between the
 
01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
ages of 3 and 21 inclusive
 
01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
which meant that we would be adding an
 
01:57:48.070 --> 01:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
extra year of service
 
01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:49.109 align:start position:0%
extra year of service
but

01:57:49.109 --> 01:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:57:52.550 --> 01:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
we would still have the same problem of
 
01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
students being booted out when they
 
01:57:57.669 --> 01:57:57.679 align:start position:0%
turned a certain age
 
01:57:57.679 --> 01:57:58.790 align:start position:0%
turned a certain age
so

01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
under federal law that age is currently
 
01:58:05.189 --> 01:58:05.199 align:start position:0%
22 when a student turns the age of 22
 
01:58:05.199 --> 01:58:06.470 align:start position:0%
22 when a student turns the age of 22
they

01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
are no longer eligible to be in the
 
01:58:08.639 --> 01:58:09.669 align:start position:0%
are no longer eligible to be in the
program

01:58:09.669 --> 01:58:09.679 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:58:12.550 --> 01:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire it's 21.
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
in both of those circumstances it means
 
01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
that a child who turns a particular age
 
01:58:23.430 --> 01:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
in november or march or whatever could
 
01:58:26.229 --> 01:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
in fact be asked to
 
01:58:28.709 --> 01:58:28.719 align:start position:0%
discontinue attending school at that
 
01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
time because they had aged out this
 
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
amendment uh changes the original bills
 
01:58:38.229 --> 01:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
on line six and seven
 
01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
01:58:41.910 --> 01:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
in the original bill it's line four from
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
the age of three in 21 inclusive to
 
01:58:48.149 --> 01:58:48.159 align:start position:0%
between the ages of three and the age
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
attained at the end of the school
 
01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
calendar year during which the student
 
01:58:55.189 --> 01:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
turns 21.
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
so that is the change that is made and
 
01:59:00.550 --> 01:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
as representative ladd mentioned it also
 
01:59:03.189 --> 01:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
changes the effective date to july 1
 
01:59:03.199 --> 01:59:05.270 align:start position:0%
changes the effective date to july 1
2023

01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
2023
 
01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
what this would allow school districts
 
01:59:08.390 --> 01:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
is to budget for extending the services
 
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
of a student who is turning 21 during
 
01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
the school year to the end of that
 
01:59:21.189 --> 01:59:21.199 align:start position:0%
school year rather than to the day that
 
01:59:23.589 --> 01:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
they turned 21.
 
01:59:26.310 --> 01:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
it's a compromise between the
 
01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
federal definition which gave an extra
 
01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
year of service but still had a student
 
01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:33.030 align:start position:0%
year of service but still had a student
terminating

01:59:33.030 --> 01:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
terminating
 
01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:35.679 align:start position:0%
services midway through the school year
 
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
in some cases
 
01:59:40.629 --> 01:59:40.639 align:start position:0%
it's a compromise between that happening
 
01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
at the age of 22 or that happening
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
following the 21st birthday
 
01:59:50.390 --> 01:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much uh
 
01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:53.350 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much uh
representatives

01:59:53.350 --> 01:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:56.229 --> 01:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
you did exactly what i was wanting to do
 
01:59:57.910 --> 01:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
as far as the end of that the age
 
01:59:59.189 --> 01:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
attained at the end of the school
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
calendar year during which student turns
 
02:00:03.669 --> 02:00:03.679 align:start position:0%
age 21 that's awesome thank you for
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
doing that uh the problem with
 
02:00:09.109 --> 02:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
and and i'm not going to blame this on
 
02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
you because i don't know who actually
 
02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
did the
 
02:00:14.790 --> 02:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
actual wording when the bill comes out
 
02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:17.730 align:start position:0%
because we know how that goes
 
02:00:17.730 --> 02:00:19.030 align:start position:0%
because we know how that goes
[Music]

02:00:19.030 --> 02:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:00:21.589 --> 02:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
but reading the first part it's now
 
02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
it was taken just the part between the
 
02:00:25.990 --> 02:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
ages of and so between the ages of three
 
02:00:28.470 --> 02:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
well between doesn't include three so
 
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
now we've lost the early end
 
02:00:33.030 --> 02:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
and then down at below
 
02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:33.990 align:start position:0%
and then down at below
um

02:00:33.990 --> 02:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
person between the ages of 18 the age
 
02:00:39.669 --> 02:00:39.679 align:start position:0%
attained we lost a word when we crossed
 
02:00:43.030 --> 02:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
out 221 so
 
02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
it's a wonderful intent but whoever
 
02:00:48.550 --> 02:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
ended up finally wording it didn't um
 
02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
edit it
 
02:00:49.679 --> 02:00:50.709 align:start position:0%
edit it
right

02:00:50.709 --> 02:00:50.719 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:00:50.719 --> 02:00:51.990 align:start position:0%
right
sorry

02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:00:54.629 --> 02:00:54.639 align:start position:0%
can and can we just is that something we
 
02:00:58.550 --> 02:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:00.070 --> 02:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
bit to make sure that we're still
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
including three
 
02:01:01.679 --> 02:01:03.270 align:start position:0%
including three
and

02:01:03.270 --> 02:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
i think down below where we crossed out
 
02:01:09.910 --> 02:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
are you getting what i'm getting
 
02:01:14.470 --> 02:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
this is the amendment this is the
 
02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:15.750 align:start position:0%
this is the amendment this is the
amendment

02:01:15.750 --> 02:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:01:17.910 --> 02:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
0307 right that's the amendment we're
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
looking at right i'm not i'm not certain
 
02:01:23.189 --> 02:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
why between the ages of three and
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
whatever that would begin at the age of
 
02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:26.870 align:start position:0%
whatever that would begin at the age of
three

02:01:26.870 --> 02:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:27.669 align:start position:0%
three
well

02:01:27.669 --> 02:01:27.679 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
i guess mathematically it begins at four
 
02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:32.870 align:start position:0%
i guess mathematically it begins at four
but

02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:01:35.750 --> 02:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
no because between i know
 
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
you would say from the age of three if
 
02:01:40.390 --> 02:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
you wanted to include three because the
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
numbers between three and eighteen are
 
02:01:45.510 --> 02:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
four through seventeen
 
02:01:47.109 --> 02:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
but at any rate
 
02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh you can but the down below on line 15
 
02:01:54.310 --> 02:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
you see where it's crossed out 221 but
 
02:01:57.430 --> 02:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
there's no word to replace it
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
and you
 
02:02:02.470 --> 02:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
needed an and or something needed to
 
02:02:05.189 --> 02:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
or leave the two in or
 
02:02:07.030 --> 02:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
because right now it says between the
 
02:02:08.550 --> 02:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
ages of 18
 
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
that looks to me to be a clerical error
 
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm saying whoever actually
 
02:02:14.950 --> 02:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
ended up writing up the amendment that's
 
02:02:17.109 --> 02:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
why i said i'm not blaming this on you
 
02:02:18.790 --> 02:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying
 
02:02:20.950 --> 02:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
that there's just
 
02:02:22.470 --> 02:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
technical things
 
02:02:26.629 --> 02:02:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess the question would be and i
 
02:02:30.390 --> 02:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that whether or
 
02:02:33.589 --> 02:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
not the word and can be uh
 
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
requested as a
 
02:02:37.589 --> 02:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
that can be requested
 
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
but what we can do is that
 
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
that that yeah but that's a process
 
02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
which we went through already this year
 
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
if we have an hour or two
 
02:02:52.390 --> 02:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
which we do have we can get this quickly
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
changed over there come back and send it
 
02:02:57.030 --> 02:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
in in the fashion we want it sent i
 
02:02:58.950 --> 02:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
would you know i hesitate in trying to
 
02:03:01.270 --> 02:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
get you know let's go with this as it is
 
02:03:02.310 --> 02:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:03:03.750 --> 02:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
then we get nailed with all the other
 
02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:06.070 align:start position:0%
then we get nailed with all the other
stuff

02:03:06.070 --> 02:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
let's try and address now specifically
 
02:03:09.750 --> 02:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
where this has to be changed and how we
 
02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
want it done and then we can send it
 
02:03:13.109 --> 02:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
over to them
 
02:03:16.790 --> 02:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
um is the first day uh area on in lines
 
02:03:19.750 --> 02:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
six and seven okay
 
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
can can we change it to from the age of
 
02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
three to the age
 
02:03:27.430 --> 02:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
attained just to make it really clear
 
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
that we are including three
 
02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
the uh original bill
 
02:03:41.350 --> 02:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
uses the word between because it says
 
02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:42.870 align:start position:0%
uses the word between because it says
inclusive

02:03:42.870 --> 02:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
inclusive
 
02:03:45.589 --> 02:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
and since inclusive got left out it
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
changes the meaning and that's
 
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
you know and that's why i said that's
 
02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
the problem when you're copying from one
 
02:03:53.669 --> 02:03:53.679 align:start position:0%
to another okay let's just copy right
 
02:03:57.030 --> 02:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
let's jump down to 15 and 16.
 
02:03:58.470 --> 02:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
15 and 16 15 would be amended to read
 
02:04:06.069 --> 02:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
person between the ages of 18 and and
 
02:04:07.750 --> 02:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
the age attained at the end of the
 
02:04:09.589 --> 02:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
school calendar year during which the
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:18.950 --> 02:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative can you take care of that
 
02:04:20.870 --> 02:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
for us yes i would be happy to do that
 
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so much
 
02:04:26.069 --> 02:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
what we we should do is get this we
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
won't kick any
 
02:04:31.830 --> 02:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
jen can you help us out here please
 
02:04:34.069 --> 02:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
um we need to get this changed here and
 
02:04:35.910 --> 02:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
we want to keep on marching down this
 
02:04:38.550 --> 02:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
list of laundry lists we have we have
 
02:04:41.589 --> 02:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
several minor changes to this amendment
 
02:04:41.599 --> 02:04:42.390 align:start position:0%
several minor changes to this amendment

02:11:15.510 --> 02:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh things accomplished in amendment 2 10
 
02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:18.790 align:start position:0%
uh things accomplished in amendment 2 10
15.

02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:22.149 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:11:22.149 --> 02:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
so now we have is um a new amendment in
 
02:11:31.189 --> 02:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:34.629 --> 02:11:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:38.880 align:start position:0%

02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
yeah where did it come from
 
02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:41.830 align:start position:0%

yes
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
i believe if i understand the
 
02:11:45.030 --> 02:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
parliamentary situation you've already
 
02:11:46.950 --> 02:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
passed an amendment on this bill
 
02:11:48.390 --> 02:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh therefore
 
02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
i would move reconsideration on that
 
02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
amendment recommend a yes vote and a no
 
02:11:54.310 --> 02:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
vote on that amendment
 
02:11:56.470 --> 02:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
and then that will reset us back to
 
02:11:57.990 --> 02:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
being able to consider this amendment
 
02:11:59.589 --> 02:11:59.599 align:start position:0%
without having previously passed an
 
02:11:59.599 --> 02:12:07.189 align:start position:0%
without having previously passed an

02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%

02:12:16.149 --> 02:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
so first action would be to reconsider
 
02:12:18.310 --> 02:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
i move that the committee reconsider its
 
02:12:20.629 --> 02:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
action on amendment 3
 
02:12:20.639 --> 02:12:21.830 align:start position:0%

02:12:26.229 --> 02:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
three nine eight eight and recommend a
 
02:12:28.550 --> 02:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
yes vote and then and then a no vote on
 
02:12:29.990 --> 02:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
the reconsideration

02:22:21.190 --> 02:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
that's okay you can just join the rest
 
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
of the clutter on my desk here
 
02:22:25.429 --> 02:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead uh you have the floor
 
02:22:27.110 --> 02:22:27.120 align:start position:0%

02:22:46.870 --> 02:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead reps and hobson take us
 
02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%

02:22:53.750 --> 02:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
so the amendment all right so
 
02:22:56.469 --> 02:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
uh i'm here to present um an amendment
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
to hb 1499 after recommendations from
 
02:23:01.830 --> 02:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
our hearing last month
 
02:23:04.870 --> 02:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh 1499 relative to charter do we want
 
02:23:07.590 --> 02:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
to have a second on the
 
02:23:10.309 --> 02:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
okay reference lectures
 
02:23:12.870 --> 02:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
and so go ahead now
 
02:23:14.870 --> 02:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
relative to chartered public school
 
02:23:17.670 --> 02:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
eligibility to state school building aid
 
02:23:19.830 --> 02:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
this bill adds chartered public schools
 
02:23:21.910 --> 02:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
to the procedures for consideration
 
02:23:24.150 --> 02:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
approval plan requirements and
 
02:23:26.710 --> 02:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
determination of grants to school for
 
02:23:28.389 --> 02:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
school building aid
 
02:23:31.110 --> 02:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
02:23:35.510 --> 02:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
simply repeals section 10 of 194 colon
 
02:23:39.030 --> 02:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
b11 prohibiting charter schools from
 
02:23:41.750 --> 02:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
receiving school building aid and adds
 
02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
that revision language through the

02:23:47.510 --> 02:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
the importance of

of building aid cannot be understated
 
02:23:52.309 --> 02:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
building aid is defined by the new

this was a great first step however
 
02:24:43.830 --> 02:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
there are additional factors that lead
 
02:24:46.309 --> 02:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
us to believe
 
02:24:48.710 --> 02:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
more should be done in this area for
 
02:24:51.270 --> 02:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
instance we have learned in many states
 
02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:51.990 align:start position:0%
instance we have learned in many states
that

02:24:51.990 --> 02:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:24:53.590 --> 02:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry my glasses are really
 
02:24:55.990 --> 02:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
bothering me
 
02:24:58.150 --> 02:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
in many states that district districts
 
02:25:00.309 --> 02:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
frequently will not declare excess space
 
02:25:02.630 --> 02:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
if they think a charter may benefit
 
02:25:04.630 --> 02:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
moreover it's extremely difficult for
 
02:25:06.870 --> 02:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
the state to enforce a definite a
 
02:25:09.349 --> 02:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
definition of excess space just as
 
02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
importantly districts frequently declare
 
02:25:14.070 --> 02:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
buildings surplus because they can
 
02:25:16.469 --> 02:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
require sufficient upgrades
 
02:25:19.030 --> 02:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
maintenance issues code violations and
 
02:25:21.349 --> 02:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
cosmetic reservations top the list for
 
02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
anyone that decides to purchase the
 
02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
space these and other concerns would
 
02:25:27.349 --> 02:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed before they can be
 
02:25:30.070 --> 02:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
a good fit for a growing charter school
 
02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of charters currently
 
02:25:34.309 --> 02:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
lease space because they cannot afford
 
02:25:36.389 --> 02:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
significant renovations for any
 
02:25:38.469 --> 02:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
buildings that's
 
02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
not just surplus district buildings
 
02:25:44.230 --> 02:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
on their operating budgets the ability
 
02:25:46.150 --> 02:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
to own their own buildings and access to
 
02:25:48.790 --> 02:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
financing is cost prohibitive
 
02:25:50.790 --> 02:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
we learned from the last survey of
 
02:25:52.389 --> 02:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
charter facilities
 
02:25:53.590 --> 02:25:53.600 align:start position:0%

facilities funding hurts students in two
ways

02:25:56.950 --> 02:25:56.960 align:start position:0%

lack of funding forces charter public

schools to use operational funding to
 
02:26:07.349 --> 02:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
pay for the building therefore taking

the hearing for fort
 
02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
hb1499 we learned two changes that could
 
02:26:20.630 --> 02:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
make this measure stronger and as a
 
02:26:23.030 --> 02:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
result i will be introducing amendment

charter schools to all pertinent areas

receiving building aid
 
02:26:54.710 --> 02:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
additionally the amendment clarifies who

owns the building
 
02:26:58.710 --> 02:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
that's question that we all had related
 
02:27:01.110 --> 02:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
to school building aid
 
02:27:02.550 --> 02:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
during the hearing we also learned that
 
02:27:04.309 --> 02:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
charter schools serve twice the number
 
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
of children in poverty that three
 
02:27:10.070 --> 02:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
public charter schools currently own
 
02:27:12.309 --> 02:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
their own building two public charter
 
02:27:13.750 --> 02:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
schools currently
 
02:27:16.389 --> 02:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
owned by foundations that leads back to
 
02:27:18.710 --> 02:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
the school and one public charter school
 
02:27:20.230 --> 02:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
owns the property and would like to
 
02:27:21.910 --> 02:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
build one
 
02:27:23.910 --> 02:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony
 
02:27:26.790 --> 02:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:28.870 --> 02:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh represent like us you were the second
 
02:27:30.710 --> 02:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
do you have any further information to
 
02:27:32.710 --> 02:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
add it's open to the floor for
 
02:27:34.710 --> 02:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
discussion representative porter
 
02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i'm not familiar
 
02:27:39.110 --> 02:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
as they should be with building aid
 
02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
situation but
 
02:27:43.110 --> 02:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
if a charter school gets building aid
 
02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
from the state and then
 
02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
in years
 
02:27:48.950 --> 02:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
subsequent years
 
02:27:51.510 --> 02:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
needs to close for a lack of
 
02:27:54.309 --> 02:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
attendance or funding what happens to
 
02:27:56.710 --> 02:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
the building aid and who's responsible
 
02:28:01.590 --> 02:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:03.349 --> 02:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
so anybody on the committee that has
 
02:28:03.359 --> 02:28:04.230 align:start position:0%
so anybody on the committee that has
that

02:28:04.230 --> 02:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:11.349 align:start position:0%
that
response

02:28:11.349 --> 02:28:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:13.110 --> 02:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
yes i believe that's mentioned in the
 
02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:16.550 align:start position:0%
yes i believe that's mentioned in the
amendment

02:28:16.550 --> 02:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:19.190 --> 02:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
can you direct us to a line please
 
02:28:26.710 --> 02:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
oh yeah section uh roman numeral 2 dash
 
02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:37.990 align:start position:0%
oh yeah section uh roman numeral 2 dash
a16

02:28:37.990 --> 02:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:28:39.670 --> 02:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:28:42.230 --> 02:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes so is re representative
 
02:28:44.309 --> 02:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
porter's question about um
 
02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the if if uh if a charter um
 
02:28:51.030 --> 02:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
terminates while it um
 
02:28:57.590 --> 02:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:59.830 --> 02:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
yes that's my question what happens if
 
02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:00.870 align:start position:0%
yes that's my question what happens if
if

02:29:00.870 --> 02:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:29:02.870 --> 02:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
situations change five years down the
 
02:29:04.389 --> 02:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
road and they're no longer there but
 
02:29:06.870 --> 02:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
they still owe building aid money to the
 
02:29:10.950 --> 02:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:12.790 --> 02:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
to follow that up the the building aid
 
02:29:15.030 --> 02:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
for a regular public school
 
02:29:17.670 --> 02:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh if you shut that plant down within 20
 
02:29:19.910 --> 02:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
years you pay it back
 
02:29:20.830 --> 02:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
that's in
 
02:29:23.910 --> 02:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
law so i guess we're looking for a
 
02:29:26.550 --> 02:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
similar type scenario here what happens
 
02:29:30.309 --> 02:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
when the charter shuts down
 
02:29:32.309 --> 02:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
do they have to be accountable to the
 
02:29:35.190 --> 02:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
same language as every other
 
02:29:37.270 --> 02:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
receiver of public aid has to a public
 
02:29:40.230 --> 02:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
school aide has to
 
02:29:48.870 --> 02:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:51.990 --> 02:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair another uh
 
02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
question that came up during the um
 
02:29:57.349 --> 02:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
during the the hearing on the the bill
 
02:29:58.870 --> 02:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
is introduced
 
02:30:03.510 --> 02:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
um is pursuant to section two
 
02:30:03.520 --> 02:30:04.790 align:start position:0%
um is pursuant to section two
uh

02:30:04.790 --> 02:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:30:07.590 --> 02:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph c in section two
 
02:30:10.550 --> 02:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
which is how the department goes about
 
02:30:12.389 --> 02:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh calculating
 
02:30:14.710 --> 02:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh what the aid percentage is between
 
02:30:17.030 --> 02:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
that thirty and sixty percent
 
02:30:20.550 --> 02:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
of cost of eligible cost of construction
 
02:30:22.230 --> 02:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
and for um
 
02:30:23.670 --> 02:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
for school districts i believe the
 
02:30:25.750 --> 02:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
department use equalized valuation
 
02:30:27.590 --> 02:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
property valuation
 
02:30:29.830 --> 02:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
slash medium family income
 
02:30:30.950 --> 02:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
right right
 
02:30:33.110 --> 02:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
and uh and so with charters obviously
 
02:30:35.830 --> 02:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
charters can accept students from
 
02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
from all across the state and from out
 
02:30:38.630 --> 02:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
of state
 
02:30:40.150 --> 02:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
as long as there's no waiting list of
 
02:30:42.150 --> 02:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
in-state students
 
02:30:42.160 --> 02:30:43.190 align:start position:0%
in-state students
so

02:30:43.190 --> 02:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:30:45.830 --> 02:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
so how they would go about calculating
 
02:30:45.840 --> 02:30:46.630 align:start position:0%
so how they would go about calculating
that

02:30:46.630 --> 02:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:30:47.750 --> 02:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
is um
 
02:30:50.710 --> 02:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
you know it it is in statute where it
 
02:30:53.030 --> 02:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
comes to public school districts
 
02:30:55.590 --> 02:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
but it's it's um i think it's an open
 
02:30:55.600 --> 02:30:57.349 align:start position:0%
but it's it's um i think it's an open
question

02:30:57.349 --> 02:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:31:00.309 --> 02:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
as it relates to charters and also as it
 
02:31:02.150 --> 02:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
relates to conversion
 
02:31:02.160 --> 02:31:03.990 align:start position:0%
relates to conversion
charters

02:31:03.990 --> 02:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
charters
 
02:31:06.150 --> 02:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative hobson
 
02:31:09.670 --> 02:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
yes i believe that the dissolution
 
02:31:11.270 --> 02:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
instructions are written into the
 
02:31:13.190 --> 02:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
charter program document the charter
 
02:31:15.830 --> 02:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
school documents
 
02:31:17.750 --> 02:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
now i think what represent luna is
 
02:31:19.990 --> 02:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
addressing is that
 
02:31:22.230 --> 02:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
the the amount of money that you receive
 
02:31:24.309 --> 02:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
through the school building aid program
 
02:31:27.270 --> 02:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
currently establishes a percentage based
 
02:31:29.190 --> 02:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
upon there's several ways of doing it
 
02:31:31.270 --> 02:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
you also maybe a district has multiple
 
02:31:32.790 --> 02:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
districts within and you're going to get
 
02:31:34.469 --> 02:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
another five percent account on top of
 
02:31:35.990 --> 02:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
that but
 
02:31:37.510 --> 02:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
it should it's up to a certain
 
02:31:40.950 --> 02:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
percentage of the cost of that grant
 
02:31:43.110 --> 02:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
total cost
 
02:31:45.510 --> 02:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
what is the percentage that is there a
 
02:31:47.830 --> 02:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
percentage or do they get a hundred
 
02:31:47.840 --> 02:31:49.510 align:start position:0%
percentage or do they get a hundred
percent

02:31:49.510 --> 02:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:31:51.910 --> 02:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
of what they're requesting and i i don't
 
02:31:54.070 --> 02:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
think that's going to be possible with
 
02:31:55.910 --> 02:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
we only have 50 million dollars to begin
 
02:31:55.920 --> 02:31:56.710 align:start position:0%
we only have 50 million dollars to begin
with

02:31:56.710 --> 02:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:31:57.670 --> 02:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
of which
 
02:31:59.750 --> 02:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
i know i'm taking a guess 32 million
 
02:32:01.750 --> 02:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
dollars is paying off yes that's the
 
02:32:04.550 --> 02:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
tail so we have 18 million available
 
02:32:04.560 --> 02:32:05.590 align:start position:0%
tail so we have 18 million available
um

02:32:05.590 --> 02:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:08.230 --> 02:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
for the entire state
 
02:32:10.710 --> 02:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
okay i was speaking to rep porter's
 
02:32:13.670 --> 02:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
question but as far as the reimbursement
 
02:32:16.550 --> 02:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh formula i i know that was an issue to
 
02:32:18.630 --> 02:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
you we do have someone in the audience
 
02:32:21.349 --> 02:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
who can speak uh directly to that if you
 
02:32:21.359 --> 02:32:22.469 align:start position:0%
who can speak uh directly to that if you
allow

02:32:22.469 --> 02:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
allow
 
02:32:24.870 --> 02:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
his testimony
 
02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
bill do you have something to add to
 
02:32:30.240 --> 02:32:32.630 align:start position:0%
bill do you have something to add to
this

02:32:32.630 --> 02:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:42.710 --> 02:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:44.389 --> 02:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
you have to
 
02:32:45.750 --> 02:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
yeah you're on now the red all right
 
02:32:46.870 --> 02:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:32:49.349 --> 02:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative luna your question is
 
02:32:52.710 --> 02:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
answered in um line nine of the of the
 
02:32:52.720 --> 02:32:53.830 align:start position:0%
answered in um line nine of the of the
amendment

02:32:53.830 --> 02:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:32:53.840 --> 02:32:54.710 align:start position:0%
amendment
that

02:32:54.710 --> 02:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:32:56.710 --> 02:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
rsa 198
 
02:32:59.670 --> 02:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
um that goes directly to a line that
 
02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
basically says the reimbursement rate is
 
02:33:01.200 --> 02:33:03.030 align:start position:0%
basically says the reimbursement rate is
30

02:33:03.030 --> 02:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
30
 
02:33:04.790 --> 02:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
there's um which is as you know the
 
02:33:08.309 --> 02:33:08.319 align:start position:0%
lowest one so it would it it is the
 
02:33:12.790 --> 02:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:15.429 --> 02:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
excuse me mr phillips um
 
02:33:18.830 --> 02:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's amended in section
 
02:33:28.150 --> 02:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:31.030 --> 02:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
and this is inserted by section two this
 
02:33:35.830 --> 02:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:39.590 --> 02:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
so so does this amendment then
 
02:33:41.590 --> 02:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
not contain the changes that are in
 
02:33:43.030 --> 02:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph c
 
02:33:45.510 --> 02:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
of the bill because it doesn't use
 
02:33:52.230 --> 02:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
by replacing it as inserted by section
 
02:33:52.240 --> 02:34:00.550 align:start position:0%
by replacing it as inserted by section
two

02:34:00.550 --> 02:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:03.270 align:start position:0%
 
is

02:34:03.270 --> 02:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:05.510 --> 02:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so so the
 
02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
the bill is introduced on page two lines
 
02:34:10.230 --> 02:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
three through six
 
02:34:12.950 --> 02:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
expand that thirty percent to be uh a
 
02:34:15.750 --> 02:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
range between thirty and sixty percent
 
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
um and would direct the state board to
 
02:34:20.469 --> 02:34:20.479 align:start position:0%
develop criteria on how to determine
 
02:34:22.309 --> 02:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
that as opposed to what's what's in
 
02:34:24.389 --> 02:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
there for school districts which is very
 
02:34:27.510 --> 02:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
specific um based on based on equalized
 
02:34:30.790 --> 02:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
valuation and uh and at median uh median
 
02:34:33.590 --> 02:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
income um so i guess the question is is
 
02:34:35.190 --> 02:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
that paragraph c
 
02:34:37.030 --> 02:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
would that be part of
 
02:34:38.790 --> 02:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
the amended bill
 
02:34:41.190 --> 02:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh it's unclear to me
 
02:34:43.750 --> 02:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
how it reads on line 21
 
02:34:43.760 --> 02:34:46.309 align:start position:0%
how it reads on line 21
what

02:34:46.309 --> 02:34:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:49.910 --> 02:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
it looks like what line 21 is saying is
 
02:34:51.990 --> 02:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
just the 2a
 
02:34:54.230 --> 02:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
part gets changed
 
02:34:56.389 --> 02:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
as it was inserted by section 2 of the
 
02:34:56.399 --> 02:34:58.230 align:start position:0%
as it was inserted by section 2 of the
bill

02:34:58.230 --> 02:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:35:01.190 --> 02:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's replacing section two
 
02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:06.230 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's replacing section two
with

02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:08.309 --> 02:35:08.319 align:start position:0%
representative you're framing the the
 
02:35:10.070 --> 02:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
problem correctly the original the
 
02:35:13.349 --> 02:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
gave the range of repayments right
 
02:35:17.830 --> 02:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
and the department at that time said it
 
02:35:20.790 --> 02:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
would be very hard for them to calculate
 
02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:22.070 align:start position:0%
would be very hard for them to calculate
so

02:35:22.070 --> 02:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:23.670 --> 02:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
representative mooney with the
 
02:35:26.230 --> 02:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
department had agreed to just let's just
 
02:35:28.630 --> 02:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
stick to one set number
 
02:35:32.550 --> 02:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:34.710 --> 02:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
the in the amendment
 
02:35:39.429 --> 02:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
line 9 which speaks to 198 1a2c
 
02:35:41.429 --> 02:35:41.439 align:start position:0%
goes directly to basically states
 
02:35:43.510 --> 02:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
charter schools shall be eligible for 30
 
02:35:43.520 --> 02:35:44.870 align:start position:0%
charter schools shall be eligible for 30
percent

02:35:44.870 --> 02:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:35:46.870 --> 02:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
that that line is supposed to fix the
 
02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
problem you're citing no no i understand
 
02:35:51.110 --> 02:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
that but the amendment doesn't
 
02:35:54.550 --> 02:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't take out paragraph c
 
02:35:56.630 --> 02:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
from the bill is introduced because the
 
02:35:59.349 --> 02:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
what the amendment on line 21 says is
 
02:35:59.359 --> 02:36:00.309 align:start position:0%
what the amendment on line 21 says is
remain

02:36:00.309 --> 02:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
remain
 
02:36:03.750 --> 02:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
amend rsa blah blah blah blah a as
 
02:36:06.070 --> 02:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
inserted by section 2 of the bill by
 
02:36:08.309 --> 02:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
replacing it with the following so it
 
02:36:08.319 --> 02:36:09.270 align:start position:0%
replacing it with the following so it
only

02:36:09.270 --> 02:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:11.830 align:start position:0%
only
amends

02:36:11.830 --> 02:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
amends
 
02:36:15.110 --> 02:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
from the bill lines 15 through 28 and
 
02:36:17.670 --> 02:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
does not make any changes to the bill is
 
02:36:22.469 --> 02:36:22.479 align:start position:0%
introduced on lines 29 on page one
 
02:36:25.110 --> 02:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
going through uh
 
02:36:29.670 --> 02:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:32.070 --> 02:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
that's how i read that but
 
02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:34.830 align:start position:0%
that's how i read that but
um

02:36:34.830 --> 02:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:37.349 --> 02:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
yeah i honestly i can't speak to it
 
02:36:38.950 --> 02:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to correct that issue to
 
02:36:40.230 --> 02:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
be clear though i understand what you're
 
02:36:40.240 --> 02:36:41.030 align:start position:0%
be clear though i understand what you're
saying

02:36:41.030 --> 02:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
saying
 
02:36:43.510 --> 02:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
so so
 
02:36:45.110 --> 02:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
yeah but it doesn't
 
02:36:47.990 --> 02:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
i think the the the language the
 
02:36:51.030 --> 02:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
language would have to read
 
02:36:53.429 --> 02:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
replace section two of the bill with the
 
02:36:53.439 --> 02:36:57.190 align:start position:0%
replace section two of the bill with the
following

02:36:57.190 --> 02:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:07.110 --> 02:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:13.510 --> 02:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:15.910 --> 02:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
you see what i was saying
 
02:37:17.830 --> 02:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not clear on where you're going to
 
02:37:20.469 --> 02:37:20.479 align:start position:0%
come up with 30 percent as the figure
 
02:37:23.270 --> 02:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:28.710 --> 02:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:31.349 --> 02:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh yeah that's that's it's 30 to 60 and
 
02:37:33.270 --> 02:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
then there's different formulas we have
 
02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
within current law i'm familiar with
 
02:37:34.800 --> 02:37:38.070 align:start position:0%
within current law i'm familiar with
those

02:37:38.070 --> 02:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:43.990 --> 02:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:47.190 --> 02:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
as i read this
 
02:37:49.830 --> 02:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:56.710 --> 02:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:58.469 --> 02:37:58.479 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if i might
 
02:37:58.479 --> 02:37:59.510 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if i might
yeah

02:37:59.510 --> 02:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:38:01.349 --> 02:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
the the original bill
 
02:38:01.359 --> 02:38:03.190 align:start position:0%
the the original bill
amends

02:38:03.190 --> 02:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
amends
 
02:38:05.910 --> 02:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
sections a through c
 
02:38:09.590 --> 02:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's on line 13 of the original bill
 
02:38:11.429 --> 02:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
and the amendment
 
02:38:14.630 --> 02:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
amends a as inserted by section two by
 
02:38:16.710 --> 02:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
replacing it with the following
 
02:38:18.630 --> 02:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
and that language
 
02:38:21.270 --> 02:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not a drafting attorney but that
 
02:38:23.590 --> 02:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
language would seem to leave
 
02:38:25.910 --> 02:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
sections b and c as amended by the
 
02:38:27.349 --> 02:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
02:38:28.710 --> 02:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
as they were
 
02:38:34.230 --> 02:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:36.389 --> 02:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
yeah and see we want to reflect the
 
02:38:39.190 --> 02:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
statute that we have right now
 
02:38:41.349 --> 02:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
i understand i think representative luna
 
02:38:43.110 --> 02:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
was arguing that um
 
02:38:48.150 --> 02:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:51.750 --> 02:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:53.590 --> 02:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment um
 
02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
on line nine
 
02:38:59.590 --> 02:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:00.790 --> 02:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
whole c
 
02:39:03.990 --> 02:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm i'm i'm arguing that mr
 
02:39:08.830 --> 02:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
phillips i'm also i i think the the um
 
02:39:11.830 --> 02:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
the the language of the bill and the
 
02:39:15.349 --> 02:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
amendment is ambiguous as it applies to
 
02:39:18.389 --> 02:39:18.399 align:start position:0%
to charter conversion charter schools
 
02:39:20.389 --> 02:39:20.399 align:start position:0%
which are property of a school district
 
02:39:22.710 --> 02:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
but they are also charter schools
 
02:39:24.389 --> 02:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:39:26.630 --> 02:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
and and then i think
 
02:39:28.950 --> 02:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
i think representative porter's question
 
02:39:32.790 --> 02:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
is um is is very significant in terms of
 
02:39:36.710 --> 02:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
what a what a charter school would do
 
02:39:39.750 --> 02:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it um it was it would
 
02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
be able to pay back
 
02:39:44.469 --> 02:39:44.479 align:start position:0%
the the gr the building aid grant to the
 
02:39:46.950 --> 02:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
state if they were to terminate within
 
02:39:50.550 --> 02:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
20 years of of the um of the grant being
 
02:39:52.870 --> 02:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
issued because school districts
 
02:39:55.670 --> 02:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
obviously are our political subdivision
 
02:39:58.469 --> 02:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
and have access to the resources to to
 
02:39:59.990 --> 02:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
do that
 
02:40:02.950 --> 02:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
charters would would i think have to
 
02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:04.150 align:start position:0%
charters would would i think have to
probably

02:40:04.150 --> 02:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:40:06.950 --> 02:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
have a surety bond or something that
 
02:40:09.750 --> 02:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
would um that would uh allow them to
 
02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
guarantee performance uh uh against that
 
02:40:15.590 --> 02:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
against that provision um i don't know
 
02:40:17.590 --> 02:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
how else they would i don't know
 
02:40:19.510 --> 02:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
bond is the right term but have have
 
02:40:21.750 --> 02:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
some sort of instrument in place that
 
02:40:24.469 --> 02:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
would guarantee performance um uh with
 
02:40:25.750 --> 02:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
that provision
 
02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:26.950 align:start position:0%
that provision
um

02:40:26.950 --> 02:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:29.910 --> 02:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
so it's a it's a complicated area for
 
02:40:33.190 --> 02:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
sure and um
 
02:40:36.070 --> 02:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
but i but i um i i compliment
 
02:40:39.910 --> 02:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative hobson for for looking to
 
02:40:41.510 --> 02:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know address i think some of the
 
02:40:46.950 --> 02:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:49.110 --> 02:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
during the hearing mr chairman may i
 
02:40:50.950 --> 02:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
actually um answer that one piece
 
02:40:52.389 --> 02:40:52.399 align:start position:0%
representative hopson
 
02:40:54.790 --> 02:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
um is correct in her answer to
 
02:40:56.630 --> 02:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
02:40:58.630 --> 02:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
in that
 
02:40:59.830 --> 02:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
if you recall from the last hearing it
 
02:41:01.110 --> 02:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
was the who owns the building what
 
02:41:02.389 --> 02:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
happens if
 
02:41:04.309 --> 02:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
the charter fails
 
02:41:06.469 --> 02:41:06.479 align:start position:0%
the language inserted here
 
02:41:08.469 --> 02:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
pointed out that the charter has to have
 
02:41:10.630 --> 02:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
a dissolution agreement with the
 
02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:11.510 align:start position:0%
a dissolution agreement with the
um

02:41:11.510 --> 02:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:13.510 --> 02:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
the department and therefore the state
 
02:41:15.429 --> 02:41:15.439 align:start position:0%
board of education
 
02:41:17.269 --> 02:41:17.279 align:start position:0%
the their
 
02:41:19.830 --> 02:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
the department could can do a couple
 
02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:21.110 align:start position:0%
the department could can do a couple
things

02:41:21.110 --> 02:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:41:21.120 --> 02:41:22.710 align:start position:0%
things
um

02:41:22.710 --> 02:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:24.070 --> 02:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
my thought originally been i'm going to
 
02:41:25.269 --> 02:41:25.279 align:start position:0%
add to your thought because i actually
 
02:41:26.950 --> 02:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
you make a good point my thought was
 
02:41:28.550 --> 02:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
originally what they could do
 
02:41:31.110 --> 02:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
was in the dissolution agreement forced
 
02:41:32.389 --> 02:41:32.399 align:start position:0%
the school
 
02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
to the the closing school to sell the
 
02:41:37.269 --> 02:41:37.279 align:start position:0%
building and therefore pay back
 
02:41:39.590 --> 02:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
the bonders and the state
 
02:41:40.950 --> 02:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
so that's i mean that's how you could
 
02:41:43.670 --> 02:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
enforce that penalty
 
02:41:45.190 --> 02:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
dissolution agreement could also
 
02:41:46.710 --> 02:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
actually include the request for a
 
02:41:48.389 --> 02:41:48.399 align:start position:0%
surety bond i hadn't thought of that but
 
02:41:49.590 --> 02:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's that that's how you could
 
02:41:52.230 --> 02:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
get at that so the language
 
02:41:54.070 --> 02:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
in the amendment
 
02:41:56.389 --> 02:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
which requires a dissolution agreement
 
02:41:58.389 --> 02:41:58.399 align:start position:0%
could cover what representative
 
02:41:59.510 --> 02:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
luna is
 
02:42:01.269 --> 02:42:01.279 align:start position:0%
suggesting and actually does answer
 
02:42:12.790 --> 02:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:14.469 --> 02:42:14.479 align:start position:0%
where does it uh
 
02:42:16.389 --> 02:42:16.399 align:start position:0%
address the dissolution agreement in
 
02:42:18.309 --> 02:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
02:42:18.319 --> 02:42:20.230 align:start position:0%
this amendment
um

02:42:20.230 --> 02:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:23.110 --> 02:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
it is uh it's line 16
 
02:42:24.309 --> 02:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
it through
 
02:42:27.670 --> 02:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:30.070 --> 02:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
in partic so it's subject to a plan for
 
02:42:32.790 --> 02:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
disposition i'm sorry disposition is uh
 
02:42:37.269 --> 02:42:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:39.190 --> 02:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
and that language on 194 actually
 
02:42:40.790 --> 02:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
specifically talks about how a charter
 
02:42:42.870 --> 02:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
has to have a
 
02:42:46.870 --> 02:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:46.880 --> 02:42:47.830 align:start position:0%
 
chairman

02:42:47.830 --> 02:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:49.590 align:start position:0%
chairman
yes

02:42:49.590 --> 02:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:42:51.110 --> 02:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
is it okay if i ask you
 
02:42:54.389 --> 02:42:54.399 align:start position:0%
this total sure thank you um i've been
 
02:42:57.510 --> 02:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
here lost on this z part of the exactly
 
02:43:00.230 --> 02:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
what you're speaking right now because
 
02:43:01.510 --> 02:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it's my lack of knowledge of
 
02:43:03.670 --> 02:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
reading the regulations but as i look at
 
02:43:06.550 --> 02:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
the z section which is on line 19 which
 
02:43:09.190 --> 02:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
we just referenced in the amendment yep
 
02:43:11.349 --> 02:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh and on our yellow books the
 
02:43:15.750 --> 02:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
non-annotated ones it's 587 h587
 
02:43:19.510 --> 02:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
on the right hand side goes to the z
 
02:43:20.870 --> 02:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
and i read through and i read through
 
02:43:20.880 --> 02:43:22.389 align:start position:0%
and i read through and i read through
that

02:43:22.389 --> 02:43:22.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:43:23.429 --> 02:43:23.439 align:start position:0%
because quote
 
02:43:25.110 --> 02:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
and then i write down i don't and it
 
02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:26.309 align:start position:0%
and then i write down i don't and it
says

02:43:26.309 --> 02:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
says
 
02:43:29.349 --> 02:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
it says uh it doesn't say anything
 
02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh the charter public schools including
 
02:43:33.110 --> 02:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
disposition of assets shall amend the
 
02:43:33.120 --> 02:43:34.150 align:start position:0%
disposition of assets shall amend the
program

02:43:34.150 --> 02:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:43:36.550 --> 02:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
amendment of his program plan but it
 
02:43:38.389 --> 02:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't and i just kept on writing
 
02:43:39.590 --> 02:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
through it two or three times i don't
 
02:43:41.830 --> 02:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
see anything that talks about
 
02:43:44.230 --> 02:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
the the solution in terms of the
 
02:43:45.910 --> 02:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
the question on hand so the mic can you
 
02:43:48.150 --> 02:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
explain why i'm lost
 
02:43:49.670 --> 02:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
i can help you get
 
02:43:49.680 --> 02:43:50.630 align:start position:0%
i can help you get
um

02:43:50.630 --> 02:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:51.830 --> 02:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's a little hard to do without reading
 
02:43:54.790 --> 02:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:56.550 --> 02:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
do you understand why i'm lost or glenn
 
02:43:59.110 --> 02:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
i don't get it yeah if i could army all
 
02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:00.070 align:start position:0%
i don't get it yeah if i could army all
right

02:44:00.070 --> 02:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:44:02.870 --> 02:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
um looking at z
 
02:44:05.910 --> 02:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
the way i i read it um
 
02:44:07.990 --> 02:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
02:44:09.269 --> 02:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
there has to be a provision for
 
02:44:09.279 --> 02:44:10.710 align:start position:0%
there has to be a provision for
dissolution

02:44:10.710 --> 02:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
dissolution
 
02:44:13.110 --> 02:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:44:15.590 --> 02:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
of its assets of its assets
 
02:44:17.269 --> 02:44:17.279 align:start position:0%
and that would be the
 
02:44:19.590 --> 02:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
school building that was
 
02:44:21.030 --> 02:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
02:44:29.269 --> 02:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:30.950 --> 02:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
i finally hear what you're saying i'm
 
02:44:32.710 --> 02:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
still lost
 
02:44:34.950 --> 02:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
i i hear what you're saying i just need
 
02:44:36.790 --> 02:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
i it must be my level i just need some
 
02:44:39.429 --> 02:44:39.439 align:start position:0%
more clarity
 
02:44:42.309 --> 02:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
okay so you said 587. yes sir on the
 
02:44:43.990 --> 02:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
right hand side about
 
02:44:46.790 --> 02:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
two inches down item z
 
02:44:49.590 --> 02:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
which is quoted on line 19 of uh
 
02:44:52.630 --> 02:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
yeah um so so provision for dissolution
 
02:44:54.950 --> 02:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
of the chartered public school including
 
02:44:57.110 --> 02:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
disposition of its assets
 
02:44:59.110 --> 02:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
or amendment of its program plan right
 
02:45:02.230 --> 02:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
so disposition of its assets would be
 
02:45:04.469 --> 02:45:04.479 align:start position:0%
the in this case would be the building
 
02:45:04.479 --> 02:45:10.710 align:start position:0%
the in this case would be the building
right

02:45:10.710 --> 02:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:12.389 --> 02:45:12.399 align:start position:0%
but i don't okay but i don't see where
 
02:45:12.399 --> 02:45:13.510 align:start position:0%
but i don't okay but i don't see where
it

02:45:13.510 --> 02:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:45:14.630 --> 02:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't tell you how it's going to do
 
02:45:15.910 --> 02:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't tell you how it's going
 
02:45:17.510 --> 02:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
to look and i don't see anything
 
02:45:19.269 --> 02:45:19.279 align:start position:0%
delineated below on
 
02:45:21.590 --> 02:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
on the building or the refinancing
 
02:45:23.110 --> 02:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
i agree it doesn't tell you but that
 
02:45:24.070 --> 02:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
literally that's what you let the
 
02:45:25.910 --> 02:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
department do that they actually in the
 
02:45:29.190 --> 02:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
event of a closure the school shall
 
02:45:31.429 --> 02:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
sell its assets and and reimburse its
 
02:45:33.190 --> 02:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
its bondholders and the state i mean
 
02:45:34.870 --> 02:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
literally i i don't think you want to be
 
02:45:36.630 --> 02:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
any more specific than that
 
02:45:37.990 --> 02:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
at least
 
02:45:39.750 --> 02:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
sure you do
 
02:45:41.349 --> 02:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
well we don't want to get into a debate
 
02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
here on that right today
 
02:45:44.080 --> 02:45:44.870 align:start position:0%
here on that right today
just

02:45:44.870 --> 02:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:45:46.790 --> 02:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
remember why can you finish that yes i
 
02:45:48.790 --> 02:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
mean one of the three of four of you
 
02:45:50.150 --> 02:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
they just
 
02:45:52.230 --> 02:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
and the last line of 19 serves it says
 
02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
as approved by the state board of
 
02:45:53.520 --> 02:45:54.870 align:start position:0%
as approved by the state board of
education

02:45:54.870 --> 02:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:45:54.880 --> 02:46:01.269 align:start position:0%
education
but

02:46:01.269 --> 02:46:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:03.030 --> 02:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
but that's this hasn't been pre-approved
 
02:46:03.040 --> 02:46:03.910 align:start position:0%
but that's this hasn't been pre-approved
but

02:46:03.910 --> 02:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:46:05.190 --> 02:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
this disillusion plan is not
 
02:46:10.710 --> 02:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:14.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:46:14.550 --> 02:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:18.389 --> 02:46:18.399 align:start position:0%
look at the top up at roman two
 
02:46:21.429 --> 02:46:21.439 align:start position:0%
because z is just part of a list
 
02:46:22.830 --> 02:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
i am i
 
02:46:26.230 --> 02:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
did i don't i i did
 
02:46:28.630 --> 02:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
if i could miss you all right i just i
 
02:46:30.790 --> 02:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
just ain't confused thank you thank you
 
02:46:30.800 --> 02:46:32.309 align:start position:0%
just ain't confused thank you thank you
cordelia

02:46:32.309 --> 02:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
cordelia
 
02:46:35.349 --> 02:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
um yes i uh have in my notes from the
 
02:46:38.550 --> 02:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
hearing that dr greene of the department
 
02:46:41.269 --> 02:46:41.279 align:start position:0%
indicated the charter has to have a
 
02:46:43.910 --> 02:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
dissolution plan which is approved by
 
02:46:46.469 --> 02:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
the department correct so that plan
 
02:46:48.070 --> 02:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
according to z
 
02:46:51.110 --> 02:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
would include dissolution of any assets
 
02:46:53.269 --> 02:46:53.279 align:start position:0%
such as the building that was subject to
 
02:46:54.870 --> 02:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
building aid
 
02:46:54.880 --> 02:46:56.309 align:start position:0%
building aid
agreed

02:46:56.309 --> 02:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
02:47:01.750 --> 02:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:03.830 --> 02:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
got for assets but do you have it for
 
02:47:03.840 --> 02:47:09.510 align:start position:0%
got for assets but do you have it for
debt

02:47:09.510 --> 02:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:10.870 --> 02:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
i assume that would be part of the
 
02:47:13.510 --> 02:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
dissolution plan
 
02:47:16.630 --> 02:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
right but but mr chair yes you know
 
02:47:18.710 --> 02:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
school districts are required to pay
 
02:47:21.990 --> 02:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
back the state grant if they dissolve or
 
02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:23.590 align:start position:0%
back the state grant if they dissolve or
or

02:47:23.590 --> 02:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:47:27.110 --> 02:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
within within a 20-year period of time
 
02:47:29.670 --> 02:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
following the the grant this doesn't
 
02:47:31.190 --> 02:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
work it just requires them to have a
 
02:47:33.030 --> 02:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
plan it doesn't necessarily have them
 
02:47:34.870 --> 02:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
require them to have a plan
 
02:47:37.750 --> 02:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
to uh to pay back the state
 
02:47:40.070 --> 02:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
and uh if that's simply being left up to
 
02:47:42.389 --> 02:47:42.399 align:start position:0%
the department i think that becomes very
 
02:47:45.110 --> 02:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
contingent upon who you know the the
 
02:47:47.429 --> 02:47:47.439 align:start position:0%
it's left up to the commissioner but in
 
02:47:49.269 --> 02:47:49.279 align:start position:0%
fact it's our obligation as the
 
02:47:51.990 --> 02:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
legislature to protect taxpayer money
 
02:47:54.230 --> 02:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
which are used to pay these grants so if
 
02:47:55.750 --> 02:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
the expectation
 
02:47:58.710 --> 02:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
is that taxpayer money would not be used
 
02:47:59.990 --> 02:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
to let's say
 
02:48:02.630 --> 02:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
build a charter school
 
02:48:06.230 --> 02:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
which is then dissolved a year later and
 
02:48:08.950 --> 02:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
with with no dissolution no no agreement
 
02:48:11.670 --> 02:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
with the with the department to to pay
 
02:48:15.269 --> 02:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
those assets back uh to the state
 
02:48:17.750 --> 02:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
left up to the department alone and then
 
02:48:19.830 --> 02:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
and then the the disposition of those
 
02:48:22.550 --> 02:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
assets is sold privately so now you've
 
02:48:25.110 --> 02:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
seen um you know construction dollars
 
02:48:27.990 --> 02:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars used to build a charter
 
02:48:30.790 --> 02:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
that then dissolves a year later and the
 
02:48:32.790 --> 02:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
um the whoever the head of the charter
 
02:48:35.110 --> 02:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
is you know sells the building keeps the
 
02:48:39.110 --> 02:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
cash so we've got to look out for for um
 
02:48:41.750 --> 02:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
for the taxpayer to prevent things like
 
02:48:43.030 --> 02:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
that from happening i mean those are
 
02:48:45.190 --> 02:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
called loopholes in the law and we need
 
02:48:47.590 --> 02:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that's even though
 
02:48:50.950 --> 02:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right that that
 
02:48:53.269 --> 02:48:53.279 align:start position:0%
up and up wouldn't wouldn't do that but
 
02:48:54.550 --> 02:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that we don't have
 
02:48:56.389 --> 02:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
loopholes in the law that enable that to
 
02:48:56.399 --> 02:48:58.710 align:start position:0%
loopholes in the law that enable that to
happen

02:48:58.710 --> 02:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:49:00.070 --> 02:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i feel like i'm getting a
 
02:49:01.750 --> 02:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
little close to a debate here i just
 
02:49:03.670 --> 02:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah we don't want to go there the
 
02:49:03.680 --> 02:49:05.269 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah we don't want to go there the
law

02:49:05.269 --> 02:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:49:07.429 --> 02:49:07.439 align:start position:0%
gives the department all tons of room to
 
02:49:07.439 --> 02:49:08.469 align:start position:0%
gives the department all tons of room to
actually

02:49:08.469 --> 02:49:08.479 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:49:10.230 --> 02:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
write an agreement such that the state
 
02:49:11.670 --> 02:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
and the bond
 
02:49:13.750 --> 02:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
holders can get paid back i don't
 
02:49:15.670 --> 02:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
i understand it's the representative
 
02:49:17.030 --> 02:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
does not think it's tight enough i'm
 
02:49:18.710 --> 02:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
suggesting that there's
 
02:49:19.990 --> 02:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
the procedure right there actually
 
02:49:21.750 --> 02:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
allows the department and the state
 
02:49:23.510 --> 02:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
board of education to
 
02:49:25.110 --> 02:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
make sure people get paid back
 
02:49:26.950 --> 02:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:49:29.190 --> 02:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
yes represent tanner um
 
02:49:30.790 --> 02:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
maybe it's because
 
02:49:33.349 --> 02:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
i haven't i know you are like
 
02:49:36.469 --> 02:49:36.479 align:start position:0%
deep into the building aid and grants um
 
02:49:37.990 --> 02:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
and i haven't been
 
02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:39.269 align:start position:0%
and i haven't been
and

02:49:39.269 --> 02:49:39.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:49:41.590 --> 02:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
it this is really um
 
02:49:43.830 --> 02:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
like too much uh
 
02:49:45.990 --> 02:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
with too much confusion
 
02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:47.590 align:start position:0%
with too much confusion
um

02:49:47.590 --> 02:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:49.110 --> 02:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
around this
 
02:49:51.830 --> 02:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
and that we need some uh balanced
 
02:49:53.990 --> 02:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
experts to come in and talk talk about
 
02:49:56.710 --> 02:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
this i think this really needs interim
 
02:49:56.720 --> 02:49:57.750 align:start position:0%
this i think this really needs interim
study

02:49:57.750 --> 02:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
study
 
02:49:59.429 --> 02:49:59.439 align:start position:0%
uh so that
 
02:50:01.750 --> 02:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
um at least
 
02:50:02.870 --> 02:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
we can
 
02:50:04.389 --> 02:50:04.399 align:start position:0%
you know get down into the weeds a
 
02:50:06.870 --> 02:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
little bit because this is just getting
 
02:50:11.349 --> 02:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
kind of almost too much today
 
02:50:13.110 --> 02:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:50:15.830 --> 02:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh yes go ahead represent woodcock this
 
02:50:18.070 --> 02:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
is a huge representative
 
02:50:20.070 --> 02:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
just for clarification for me
 
02:50:23.990 --> 02:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
the the 30 percent payback
 
02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:24.950 align:start position:0%
the the 30 percent payback
for

02:50:24.950 --> 02:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:50:27.269 --> 02:50:27.279 align:start position:0%
public public schools
 
02:50:29.990 --> 02:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
right now if it isn't if you're a public
 
02:50:32.150 --> 02:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
let's say your district receives 30 of
 
02:50:34.469 --> 02:50:34.479 align:start position:0%
what you're asking for right okay okay
 
02:50:34.479 --> 02:50:35.349 align:start position:0%
what you're asking for right okay okay
so

02:50:35.349 --> 02:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:50:37.110 --> 02:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
the payback
 
02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:37.910 align:start position:0%
the payback
will

02:50:37.910 --> 02:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
will
 
02:50:40.870 --> 02:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
the payback of the money if it dissolves
 
02:50:43.670 --> 02:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
do i understand that correctly it's 30
 
02:50:43.680 --> 02:50:45.910 align:start position:0%
do i understand that correctly it's 30
no

02:50:45.910 --> 02:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:47.349 --> 02:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
if the pay you have to pay it all back
 
02:50:48.950 --> 02:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
you have to pay everything you got back
 
02:50:50.950 --> 02:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
okay under the okay so can i fall off
 
02:50:52.070 --> 02:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
the other part i was trying to get
 
02:50:53.910 --> 02:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
through because i was lost i'm coming
 
02:50:56.150 --> 02:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
out of the weeds here so
 
02:50:58.950 --> 02:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
under this going back to that z piece
 
02:50:58.960 --> 02:50:59.750 align:start position:0%
under this going back to that z piece
that

02:50:59.750 --> 02:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:51:02.870 --> 02:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
seems to be confusing at least to me um
 
02:51:04.790 --> 02:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
and it goes to the department where it's
 
02:51:04.800 --> 02:51:05.830 align:start position:0%
and it goes to the department where it's
not

02:51:05.830 --> 02:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:51:07.190 --> 02:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
it was going to be
 
02:51:09.190 --> 02:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
the same as
 
02:51:10.550 --> 02:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
the current
 
02:51:12.550 --> 02:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
building aid law
 
02:51:14.710 --> 02:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
that would be a hundred percent
 
02:51:15.990 --> 02:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
right if it could be exactly the same as
 
02:51:18.389 --> 02:51:18.399 align:start position:0%
a public school 100 percent i heard this
 
02:51:20.710 --> 02:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
gentleman talking in
 
02:51:20.720 --> 02:51:22.070 align:start position:0%
gentleman talking in
representative

02:51:22.070 --> 02:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:51:24.389 --> 02:51:24.399 align:start position:0%
munoz conversation that would be up to
 
02:51:24.399 --> 02:51:25.269 align:start position:0%
munoz conversation that would be up to
the

02:51:25.269 --> 02:51:25.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:51:26.950 --> 02:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
doa to make that determine thank you
 
02:51:28.950 --> 02:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
determination so does that mean that
 
02:51:31.429 --> 02:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
they could be changed by
 
02:51:32.790 --> 02:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
charter school so
 
02:51:34.710 --> 02:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
one child school get fifty percent one
 
02:51:36.469 --> 02:51:36.479 align:start position:0%
paid back forty percent or twenty
 
02:51:39.349 --> 02:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
percent would that be since it's not set
 
02:51:41.190 --> 02:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
and standard because the only standard
 
02:51:43.990 --> 02:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
is public which is a hundred
 
02:51:46.150 --> 02:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
now i'm a little bit lost on you on the
 
02:51:47.830 --> 02:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
public getting a hundred percent they
 
02:51:50.070 --> 02:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
don't get 100 they have to pay back 100
 
02:51:52.070 --> 02:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
of their money right
 
02:51:53.750 --> 02:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
on the grant
 
02:51:55.670 --> 02:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
so under this under this
 
02:51:57.510 --> 02:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
where we just said that the state board
 
02:51:59.269 --> 02:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
is going to set it for under this but
 
02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
chatter schools and he said they would
 
02:52:02.630 --> 02:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
do that which is fine
 
02:52:04.870 --> 02:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
my question is would that then be a
 
02:52:06.950 --> 02:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
varying amount because on the public
 
02:52:08.710 --> 02:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
school it's a hundred percent so but
 
02:52:10.710 --> 02:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
that doesn't say that here for charter
 
02:52:12.630 --> 02:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
schools the comments you made where the
 
02:52:14.389 --> 02:52:14.399 align:start position:0%
doa would set it
 
02:52:15.990 --> 02:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
from the solution plan
 
02:52:17.269 --> 02:52:17.279 align:start position:0%
so my question is could that be a
 
02:52:18.550 --> 02:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
variable amount
 
02:52:20.790 --> 02:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
could be 40 for one child school 100 for
 
02:52:20.800 --> 02:52:23.750 align:start position:0%
could be 40 for one child school 100 for
another

02:52:23.750 --> 02:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:23.760 --> 02:52:25.670 align:start position:0%
 
probably

02:52:25.670 --> 02:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:52:27.429 --> 02:52:27.439 align:start position:0%
i don't want to make a respond to that
 
02:52:28.710 --> 02:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
because i really
 
02:52:30.630 --> 02:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite understanding where you're
 
02:52:33.030 --> 02:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
coming back with the hundred percent uh
 
02:52:35.030 --> 02:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
they'd have to pay back the total grant
 
02:52:38.870 --> 02:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
which they had received from the state
 
02:52:41.110 --> 02:52:41.120 align:start position:0%
from that pot that from the 50 million
 
02:52:42.950 --> 02:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
and i is this money coming from the 50
 
02:52:42.960 --> 02:52:44.389 align:start position:0%
and i is this money coming from the 50
million

02:52:44.389 --> 02:52:44.399 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:52:46.309 --> 02:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
or is there a separate pot that's what i
 
02:52:47.510 --> 02:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
was asking you
 
02:52:48.790 --> 02:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
i i don't know
 
02:52:51.510 --> 02:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know okay i have not i've never
 
02:52:53.190 --> 02:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
discussed you know building aid for
 
02:52:55.110 --> 02:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
charter schools prior to this okay and
 
02:52:57.429 --> 02:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
it's all coming in pretty fast yeah okay
 
02:52:58.950 --> 02:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:53:00.790 --> 02:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
so so mr chair i do i do believe it
 
02:53:02.710 --> 02:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
would be a varying amount between 30 and
 
02:53:05.670 --> 02:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
60 percent because paragraph c on page
 
02:53:07.590 --> 02:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
two of the bill is still in there even
 
02:53:09.349 --> 02:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
if the bill were amended
 
02:53:11.510 --> 02:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh with this so well if that part's in
 
02:53:12.950 --> 02:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
there yes it would be but it'd be
 
02:53:14.870 --> 02:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
varying based upon
 
02:53:16.710 --> 02:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
the criteria
 
02:53:18.790 --> 02:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
which we don't know
 
02:53:20.870 --> 02:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
we know it for the public school system
 
02:53:20.880 --> 02:53:21.830 align:start position:0%
we know it for the public school system
that's

02:53:21.830 --> 02:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:53:23.510 --> 02:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
based upon those two criteria which been
 
02:53:25.030 --> 02:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned here earlier
 
02:53:26.870 --> 02:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
um but that was my point because i
 
02:53:28.950 --> 02:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
didn't i couldn't understand that yeah
 
02:53:30.630 --> 02:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
thank you i didn't think it was fair but
 
02:53:32.309 --> 02:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
with the charter schools kids are coming
 
02:53:33.910 --> 02:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
from all kinds of different
 
02:53:36.070 --> 02:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
directions different districts etc and
 
02:53:37.269 --> 02:53:37.279 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
02:53:39.910 --> 02:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
we can't use that same two variables
 
02:53:41.429 --> 02:53:41.439 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:53:41.439 --> 02:53:42.389 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
representative

02:53:42.389 --> 02:53:42.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:53:44.950 --> 02:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i think the intent in the amendment
 
02:53:48.950 --> 02:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
was um to have a flat rate of 30 percent
 
02:53:54.389 --> 02:53:54.399 align:start position:0%
uh but inadvertently um that section c
 
02:53:57.349 --> 02:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh remains um and is not removed in the
 
02:54:02.070 --> 02:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:03.670 --> 02:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
that would make a variable right glenn
 
02:54:06.550 --> 02:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
because it's not in there okay that's my
 
02:54:07.910 --> 02:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
whole question that that was the whole
 
02:54:09.670 --> 02:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
point that was yeah okay thank you
 
02:54:11.190 --> 02:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate your help
 
02:54:13.110 --> 02:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
mr chairman just to add to
 
02:54:14.469 --> 02:54:14.479 align:start position:0%
representative cordelia's point you
 
02:54:17.190 --> 02:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
could clarify that by just striking that
 
02:54:19.429 --> 02:54:19.439 align:start position:0%
that c-section and then it's it's 30
 
02:54:23.990 --> 02:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:25.670 --> 02:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about another amendment
 
02:54:25.680 --> 02:54:27.510 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about another amendment
here

02:54:27.510 --> 02:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:54:29.269 --> 02:54:29.279 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah all this has to be done today
 
02:54:30.790 --> 02:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
and we're starting to slide with a lot
 
02:54:33.110 --> 02:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
of amendments and unfortunately
 
02:54:34.469 --> 02:54:34.479 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we have the time to keep
 
02:54:36.550 --> 02:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
doing this uh we're not making any
 
02:54:39.269 --> 02:54:39.279 align:start position:0%
progress at all today and and in
 
02:54:41.190 --> 02:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
addition mr chair i think there still is
 
02:54:43.429 --> 02:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
that open question uh well it's not an
 
02:54:46.550 --> 02:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
open question in the amendment roman 2a
 
02:54:48.150 --> 02:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
on section 1
 
02:54:49.990 --> 02:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
leaves it up to the department to
 
02:54:53.030 --> 02:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
determine the disposition or
 
02:54:54.630 --> 02:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
to determine in conjunction with the
 
02:54:56.950 --> 02:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
charter with respect to the disposition
 
02:54:58.150 --> 02:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
of assets
 
02:55:00.950 --> 02:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
and and even if even if
 
02:55:02.550 --> 02:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph c
 
02:55:05.190 --> 02:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
were to remain as it's in statute right
 
02:55:07.750 --> 02:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
now where the state grant is 30 of
 
02:55:09.910 --> 02:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
eligible construction costs that would
 
02:55:13.030 --> 02:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
likely mean that the charter is
 
02:55:15.190 --> 02:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
somehow either combination of
 
02:55:17.750 --> 02:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
fundraising or bonding
 
02:55:21.110 --> 02:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
raising the the remaining 70 percent and
 
02:55:25.429 --> 02:55:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:27.910 --> 02:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
lien holder on the on the charter would
 
02:55:30.630 --> 02:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
be the bond nut company and certainly
 
02:55:32.710 --> 02:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
the state's not a lien holder in that
 
02:55:35.030 --> 02:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
case certainly not in first position
 
02:55:35.040 --> 02:55:35.910 align:start position:0%
case certainly not in first position
so

02:55:35.910 --> 02:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:55:38.230 --> 02:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
so it really does raise the question of
 
02:55:41.110 --> 02:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
how the state gets gets paid back even
 
02:55:42.870 --> 02:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
if that were to be included an agreement
 
02:55:45.110 --> 02:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
between the department and the uh the
 
02:55:46.870 --> 02:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
charter because it's not in
 
02:55:49.110 --> 02:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
we're not requiring apparently not being
 
02:55:52.389 --> 02:55:52.399 align:start position:0%
required in this bill or the amendment
 
02:55:54.230 --> 02:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
is there any rule making authority given
 
02:55:56.230 --> 02:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
to the department to make the decision
 
02:55:58.870 --> 02:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
on how to the criteria for setting up
 
02:56:01.910 --> 02:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
the disposition and processes uh
 
02:56:04.630 --> 02:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that you know
 
02:56:06.469 --> 02:56:06.479 align:start position:0%
that we could get a lot of inconsistency
 
02:56:08.469 --> 02:56:08.479 align:start position:0%
here between these agreements or
 
02:56:11.030 --> 02:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
disposition agreements between one
 
02:56:13.670 --> 02:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
charter and another charter if in fact
 
02:56:16.950 --> 02:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
we haven't taken that process through
 
02:56:20.309 --> 02:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and back to jail car
 
02:56:20.319 --> 02:56:22.389 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and back to jail car
to

02:56:22.389 --> 02:56:22.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:56:24.389 --> 02:56:24.399 align:start position:0%
establish a process that's going to be
 
02:56:24.399 --> 02:56:27.510 align:start position:0%
establish a process that's going to be
consistent

02:56:27.510 --> 02:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:28.870 --> 02:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i don't know the answer on
 
02:56:34.309 --> 02:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:36.389 --> 02:56:36.399 align:start position:0%
well the thing is what we're dealing
 
02:56:38.950 --> 02:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
with here we're dealing with a totally
 
02:56:40.469 --> 02:56:40.479 align:start position:0%
new area
 
02:56:43.830 --> 02:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
of law dealing with and i support
 
02:56:45.830 --> 02:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
charter schools yes i do
 
02:56:48.150 --> 02:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
but there are some fiscal questions here
 
02:56:50.870 --> 02:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
and processes that you know are
 
02:56:53.510 --> 02:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
explained in a couple sentences without
 
02:56:55.110 --> 02:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of you know
 
02:56:58.150 --> 02:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh in-depth understanding um
 
02:56:59.990 --> 02:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh are they gonna have to jump on that
 
02:57:02.070 --> 02:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
same list the 10-year projection list
 
02:57:05.269 --> 02:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
which we just passed previously uh in in
 
02:57:07.910 --> 02:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
the previous session uh are they on a
 
02:57:09.190 --> 02:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
separate list
 
02:57:11.510 --> 02:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
i you know none of that to me is really
 
02:57:13.349 --> 02:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
clear i haven't had time to read at all
 
02:57:15.429 --> 02:57:15.439 align:start position:0%
and that's that's part of my problem and
 
02:57:17.110 --> 02:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
sort of your first one is that this just
 
02:57:19.269 --> 02:57:19.279 align:start position:0%
gives them the ability to get on the
 
02:57:21.269 --> 02:57:21.279 align:start position:0%
list of as all other public schools
 
02:57:22.469 --> 02:57:22.479 align:start position:0%
there's not nothing there's not a
 
02:57:26.150 --> 02:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:27.429 --> 02:57:27.439 align:start position:0%
so at any rate we're going to need an
 
02:57:30.309 --> 02:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:30.319 --> 02:57:31.190 align:start position:0%
 
or

02:57:31.190 --> 02:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:57:34.150 --> 02:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
or or move it to interim study
 
02:57:35.830 --> 02:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
rick i mean
 
02:57:37.510 --> 02:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
we've had tons of bills
 
02:57:39.429 --> 02:57:39.439 align:start position:0%
and we can't yeah i i got that and we
 
02:57:40.790 --> 02:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
have about five hours to get them all
 
02:57:40.800 --> 02:57:41.830 align:start position:0%
have about five hours to get them all
done

02:57:41.830 --> 02:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:57:45.030 --> 02:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
so um what we'll do is we'll
 
02:57:46.870 --> 02:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
break right now because it's time for
 
02:57:49.349 --> 02:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
lunch time to really re regather
 
02:57:51.030 --> 02:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
ourselves a little bit here we can have
 
02:57:52.790 --> 02:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
a discussion during lunch
 
02:57:55.110 --> 02:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
and and then come back and and pick this
 
02:57:56.870 --> 02:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
one up at that time
 
02:57:59.030 --> 02:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna break right now it's 12
 
02:57:59.040 --> 02:57:59.990 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna break right now it's 12
o'clock

02:57:59.990 --> 02:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
02:58:02.070 --> 02:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
and we'll come back uh we're going to
 
02:58:04.950 --> 02:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
take a 45 minute today not not an hour
 
02:58:06.950 --> 02:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
cut it back to 45 minutes
 
02:58:08.870 --> 02:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
so we can try to get this stuff done
 
02:58:20.790 --> 02:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:20.800 --> 02:58:26.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:58:26.370 --> 02:58:26.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:26.380 --> 02:58:59.830 align:start position:0%

um
basically

03:59:21.670 --> 03:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
basically
 
03:59:24.710 --> 03:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh leaves in
 
03:59:27.349 --> 03:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
the requirement from the original bill
 
03:59:30.229 --> 03:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
that accommodations may be provided
 
03:59:33.030 --> 03:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
for the examination
 
03:59:35.349 --> 03:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
but it clarifies
 
03:59:37.750 --> 03:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
that the results of just
 
03:59:40.229 --> 03:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
the us citizenship
 
03:59:42.790 --> 03:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
test would be sent to the part to the
 
03:59:46.710 --> 03:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
department not both the local assessment
 
03:59:46.720 --> 03:59:47.750 align:start position:0%
department not both the local assessment
and

03:59:47.750 --> 03:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:59:50.389 --> 03:59:50.399 align:start position:0%
the civics test
 
03:59:52.550 --> 03:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
since the local assessment
 
03:59:55.590 --> 03:59:55.600 align:start position:0%
could vary between districts uh i'm not
 
03:59:59.110 --> 03:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
sure of um the value to the department
 
04:00:01.750 --> 04:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
so um it would just be the u.s
 
04:00:03.990 --> 04:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
citizenship test that is results that
 
04:00:06.309 --> 04:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
are sent to the department
 
04:00:08.790 --> 04:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
04:00:14.229 --> 04:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:16.469 --> 04:00:16.479 align:start position:0%
why do these why are these tests um i
 
04:00:17.590 --> 04:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't here for the initial discussion
 
04:00:19.349 --> 04:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
yesterday why do these tests need to be
 
04:00:21.030 --> 04:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
submitted to the
 
04:00:24.710 --> 04:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
deal anyhow what are the results
 
04:00:36.790 --> 04:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:38.790 --> 04:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:00:41.030 --> 04:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh they can
 
04:00:43.269 --> 04:00:43.279 align:start position:0%
track that the assessments are being
 
04:00:46.469 --> 04:00:46.479 align:start position:0%
done and also uh have an idea of
 
04:00:49.189 --> 04:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
how our students are doing on the
 
04:00:53.110 --> 04:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:58.150 --> 04:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:00.150 --> 04:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
i i don't understand okay i hear what
 
04:01:03.990 --> 04:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:05.590 --> 04:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
the department wants to track how the
 
04:01:07.750 --> 04:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
students are doing on a
 
04:01:10.630 --> 04:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
test that's right off the computer
 
04:01:18.309 --> 04:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:20.309 --> 04:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
if were you asking a question
 
04:01:21.830 --> 04:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
or you know discussion i was just trying
 
04:01:23.349 --> 04:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
to ask that a question
 
04:01:24.469 --> 04:01:24.479 align:start position:0%
well you don't have to ask a question
 
04:01:26.070 --> 04:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
you can just discuss it i don't think we
 
04:01:27.429 --> 04:01:27.439 align:start position:0%
could hear you all the way over here
 
04:01:27.439 --> 04:01:28.229 align:start position:0%
could hear you all the way over here
okay

04:01:28.229 --> 04:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:01:29.990 --> 04:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you you know i was surprised that
 
04:01:33.030 --> 04:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
the the department had to or is
 
04:01:35.189 --> 04:01:35.199 align:start position:0%
collecting this data when the the
 
04:01:36.550 --> 04:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
information is downloaded from a
 
04:01:38.550 --> 04:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
computer with a testing answers i don't
 
04:01:39.910 --> 04:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
understand what the
 
04:01:41.269 --> 04:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why why this would be
 
04:01:43.349 --> 04:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
valuable for them to collect
 
04:01:44.150 --> 04:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
and what do they think what are they
 
04:01:45.349 --> 04:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
going to do if
 
04:01:47.110 --> 04:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
school doesn't that
 
04:01:48.389 --> 04:01:48.399 align:start position:0%
they've already said it's requirement of
 
04:01:48.399 --> 04:01:50.150 align:start position:0%
they've already said it's requirement of
graduation

04:01:50.150 --> 04:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
graduation
 
04:01:51.910 --> 04:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
so i just i don't i don't understand the
 
04:01:56.389 --> 04:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:58.710 --> 04:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
further discussed represent luna
 
04:02:01.189 --> 04:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much so um based on
 
04:02:04.309 --> 04:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
what representative cordelli um has said
 
04:02:07.269 --> 04:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
could um could we ask the department
 
04:02:09.670 --> 04:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
since they're recording and tracking uh
 
04:02:12.630 --> 04:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
how our students are doing on both the
 
04:02:14.550 --> 04:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
currently under under law both the
 
04:02:16.790 --> 04:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
locally developed competency assessment
 
04:02:16.800 --> 04:02:17.990 align:start position:0%
locally developed competency assessment
um

04:02:17.990 --> 04:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:19.590 --> 04:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh of the united states government and
 
04:02:23.110 --> 04:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
civics as well as the um the uscis could
 
04:02:25.349 --> 04:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
we request a report from the department
 
04:02:27.830 --> 04:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
on how our students are presently doing
 
04:02:29.750 --> 04:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
on both these two tests can we get that
 
04:02:34.550 --> 04:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:36.790 --> 04:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
i have no idea whether they have that
 
04:02:41.750 --> 04:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:41.760 --> 04:02:43.030 align:start position:0%
 
here

04:02:43.030 --> 04:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:02:44.469 --> 04:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
i don't think she's here
 
04:02:48.469 --> 04:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:50.309 --> 04:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
on the horn she's she's in the hallway
 
04:02:53.990 --> 04:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
now on the horn oh okay okay so um so
 
04:02:56.389 --> 04:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
that's that's the first part i think i
 
04:02:58.309 --> 04:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
i think it makes sense for for our
 
04:03:00.150 --> 04:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
committee to at least be able to
 
04:03:02.389 --> 04:03:02.399 align:start position:0%
baseline based on what representative
 
04:03:03.830 --> 04:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
cordelli said that there's too much
 
04:03:06.389 --> 04:03:06.399 align:start position:0%
variability in the locally developed one
 
04:03:09.349 --> 04:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
but in fact um statue
 
04:03:11.269 --> 04:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
says a locally developed competency
 
04:03:12.550 --> 04:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
assessment of the united states
 
04:03:14.550 --> 04:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
government and civics that includes but
 
04:03:16.710 --> 04:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
is not limited to the nature purpose
 
04:03:18.309 --> 04:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
structure function in history of the
 
04:03:20.229 --> 04:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
united states government the rights and
 
04:03:22.309 --> 04:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of citizens
 
04:03:24.469 --> 04:03:24.479 align:start position:0%
and noteworthy government and civics
 
04:03:26.229 --> 04:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
leaders shall be administered to
 
04:03:28.229 --> 04:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
students as part of the required high
 
04:03:29.990 --> 04:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
school course in history and government
 
04:03:32.229 --> 04:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
of the united states and
 
04:03:33.590 --> 04:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
04:03:35.990 --> 04:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
so that's in paragraph
 
04:03:37.750 --> 04:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
um the paragraph that immediately
 
04:03:39.510 --> 04:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
follows stopping right there at the end
 
04:03:41.830 --> 04:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
of that sentence
 
04:03:43.830 --> 04:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
when that was put in there there was no
 
04:03:43.840 --> 04:03:45.429 align:start position:0%
when that was put in there there was no
intent

04:03:45.429 --> 04:03:45.439 align:start position:0%
intent
 
04:03:47.349 --> 04:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
i can remember doing it that there's no
 
04:03:49.269 --> 04:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
intent to forward that on they just had
 
04:03:52.309 --> 04:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
to complete that at the local level to
 
04:03:54.950 --> 04:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
determine if the you know it was a step
 
04:03:54.960 --> 04:03:56.550 align:start position:0%
determine if the you know it was a step
towards

04:03:56.550 --> 04:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
towards
 
04:03:58.550 --> 04:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
graduation i don't you know i i don't
 
04:04:00.150 --> 04:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
even know if it was that but it was
 
04:04:01.670 --> 04:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
never intended to go to the department
 
04:04:03.910 --> 04:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
that one was not i think what we have
 
04:04:06.790 --> 04:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
here on this immunization
 
04:04:06.800 --> 04:04:08.630 align:start position:0%
here on this immunization
immunization

04:04:08.630 --> 04:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
immunization
 
04:04:12.469 --> 04:04:12.479 align:start position:0%
immigration test on citizenship uh that
 
04:04:12.479 --> 04:04:13.429 align:start position:0%
immigration test on citizenship uh that
it's

04:04:13.429 --> 04:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:04:15.349 --> 04:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
04:04:18.309 --> 04:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
the makers are trying to get that
 
04:04:18.319 --> 04:04:19.349 align:start position:0%
the makers are trying to get that
aggregate

04:04:19.349 --> 04:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
aggregate
 
04:04:21.990 --> 04:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
data from the department as to
 
04:04:24.070 --> 04:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
where our kids are functioning in regard
 
04:04:25.670 --> 04:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
to that test
 
04:04:27.910 --> 04:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
right but oh and and i see attorney
 
04:04:29.030 --> 04:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
fenton has
 
04:04:29.040 --> 04:04:30.150 align:start position:0%

is here could we ask her if um if we can
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:38.790 --> 04:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
reps on fenton uh
 
04:04:38.800 --> 04:04:40.150 align:start position:0%
reps on fenton uh
uh-oh

i don't know if you're down to captain

04:04:57.429 --> 04:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
representative ladd well you should see
 
04:04:59.910 --> 04:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
how many bills we ended up in recess so
 
04:05:01.750 --> 04:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative ladd
 
04:05:02.870 --> 04:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
i have a question
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
no no no no no no we
 
04:05:08.150 --> 04:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
what is the question so so the the
 
04:05:09.349 --> 04:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
the question
 
04:05:11.269 --> 04:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
is uh based on what representative
 
04:05:13.670 --> 04:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
cordelli said that the um that the
 
04:05:16.870 --> 04:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
department currently records and tracks
 
04:05:18.630 --> 04:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
student performance
 
04:05:21.189 --> 04:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
on both the locally developed competency
 
04:05:23.110 --> 04:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
assessment for united states government
 
04:05:24.469 --> 04:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
and civics
 
04:05:28.950 --> 04:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
and the the u.s citizenship and
 
04:05:31.750 --> 04:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
immigration services test was wondering
 
04:05:34.710 --> 04:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
if we could get a um a present report a
 
04:05:36.870 --> 04:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
current report from the department on
 
04:05:38.630 --> 04:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
how students across the state are doing
 
04:05:39.910 --> 04:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
on both those
 
04:05:39.920 --> 04:05:45.269 align:start position:0%
on both those
tests

04:05:45.269 --> 04:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:48.389 --> 04:05:48.399 align:start position:0%
can that even happen today
 
04:05:50.710 --> 04:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
i will do my best because that would
 
04:05:53.110 --> 04:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
happen today i understand where we are
 
04:05:55.030 --> 04:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
procedurally in the hearing and yes i
 
04:05:59.830 --> 04:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:02.229 --> 04:06:02.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that we're even this bill
 
04:06:05.590 --> 04:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
has even been implemented yet um so
 
04:06:08.790 --> 04:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
on the civic uh citizenship test
 
04:06:10.870 --> 04:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
we've had the other portion in law for a
 
04:06:14.550 --> 04:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:16.389 --> 04:06:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh i have a question then representative
 
04:06:18.870 --> 04:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
porter um
 
04:06:21.110 --> 04:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
where where the local test is an
 
04:06:24.790 --> 04:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
assessment that's designed locally
 
04:06:27.030 --> 04:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
you must then have like the you do with
 
04:06:29.750 --> 04:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
your inputs as far as you know and you
 
04:06:29.760 --> 04:06:30.710 align:start position:0%
your inputs as far as you know and you
have

04:06:30.710 --> 04:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:06:32.870 --> 04:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
testing which you got the information on
 
04:06:35.030 --> 04:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
but the inputs are basically a narrative
 
04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
report to the department on adequacy
 
04:06:40.710 --> 04:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
is that similar to what we have here
 
04:06:42.389 --> 04:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
with this locally designed that there's
 
04:06:44.870 --> 04:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
a narrative report given or
 
04:06:46.790 --> 04:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
or do you get their actual assessment
 
04:06:48.550 --> 04:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
itself and
 
04:06:49.990 --> 04:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
and look at the
 
04:06:52.070 --> 04:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
that data
 
04:06:53.910 --> 04:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure and for the record diana
 
04:06:55.189 --> 04:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
fenton an attorney with the department
 
04:06:57.189 --> 04:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
of education um
 
04:06:58.950 --> 04:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if we get it in a narrative
 
04:07:01.269 --> 04:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
form but the issue you have identified
 
04:07:02.469 --> 04:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
is one that the department has
 
04:07:03.990 --> 04:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
identified that
 
04:07:05.990 --> 04:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
we get variations
 
04:07:08.790 --> 04:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
of these reports in and so there is no
 
04:07:10.070 --> 04:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's hard to have a
 
04:07:12.469 --> 04:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
standard to compare them to if they're
 
04:07:15.110 --> 04:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
all if they're locally designed so i
 
04:07:17.349 --> 04:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
will let you know if it is a narrative
 
04:07:25.110 --> 04:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:26.710 --> 04:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:07:28.229 --> 04:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know if this is necessary you
 
04:07:30.710 --> 04:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
gotta bring the mic down
 
04:07:32.309 --> 04:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
hello yeah
 
04:07:32.319 --> 04:07:33.910 align:start position:0%
hello yeah
testing

04:07:33.910 --> 04:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
testing
 
04:07:35.910 --> 04:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know if this is a question for
 
04:07:38.950 --> 04:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
you attorney fentanyl for the group um
 
04:07:43.110 --> 04:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
i'm looking up uh rsa 189 11 and it
 
04:07:44.870 --> 04:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
pertains to both public and private
 
04:07:47.590 --> 04:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
schools do the provisions of this bill
 
04:07:47.600 --> 04:07:49.590 align:start position:0%
schools do the provisions of this bill
also

04:07:49.590 --> 04:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
also
 
04:07:51.189 --> 04:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
pertain to both public and private
 
04:07:51.199 --> 04:07:56.070 align:start position:0%
pertain to both public and private
schools

04:07:56.070 --> 04:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:57.990 --> 04:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
in other words are we requiring private
 
04:07:59.429 --> 04:07:59.439 align:start position:0%
schools to give
 
04:08:01.750 --> 04:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
the citizenship test now
 
04:08:03.269 --> 04:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
and if so
 
04:08:07.510 --> 04:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:09.110 --> 04:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
so i i do not
 
04:08:11.750 --> 04:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
have my law book in front of me um which
 
04:08:22.790 --> 04:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:24.790 --> 04:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
we gave you a free copy
 
04:08:26.950 --> 04:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
i know i actually don't tell anyone but
 
04:08:29.189 --> 04:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
i have two free copies
 
04:08:30.070 --> 04:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
i know
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
this isn't being recorded is it
 
04:08:32.880 --> 04:08:34.309 align:start position:0%
this isn't being recorded is it
um

04:08:34.309 --> 04:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:36.309 --> 04:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
04:08:37.750 --> 04:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
i'm glad people thought that was
 
04:08:37.760 --> 04:08:48.550 align:start position:0%
i'm glad people thought that was
humorous

04:08:48.550 --> 04:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:50.469 --> 04:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
oh gosh i was gonna do what i do and
 
04:09:19.189 --> 04:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:23.349 --> 04:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
um if i might mr chairman um uh 189
 
04:09:25.269 --> 04:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
11 that we're talking about i believe it
 
04:09:26.550 --> 04:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
takes effect
 
04:09:35.750 --> 04:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:37.670 --> 04:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
the way it was originally
 
04:09:39.510 --> 04:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
put together though
 
04:09:42.229 --> 04:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
you could develop a locally designed
 
04:09:44.710 --> 04:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
assessment test
 
04:09:47.510 --> 04:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
and if you pass that into school you are
 
04:09:49.510 --> 04:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
awarded a certificate
 
04:09:51.750 --> 04:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
it didn't necessarily say graduation and
 
04:09:53.429 --> 04:09:53.439 align:start position:0%
said you could get a certificate for
 
04:09:56.149 --> 04:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
completing this successfully that's i
 
04:09:58.389 --> 04:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
think as far as we had taken it when we
 
04:10:01.429 --> 04:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:03.349 --> 04:10:03.359 align:start position:0%
and there was also the option that if
 
04:10:04.870 --> 04:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
you didn't do that you could use the
 
04:10:04.880 --> 04:10:05.590 align:start position:0%
you didn't do that you could use the
other

04:10:05.590 --> 04:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:10:18.070 --> 04:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:20.229 --> 04:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
can i ask a question while diana sure
 
04:10:20.239 --> 04:10:20.950 align:start position:0%
can i ask a question while diana sure
yes

04:10:20.950 --> 04:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:10:22.630 --> 04:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
would there be a cost to the local
 
04:10:25.670 --> 04:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
school district for doing this
 
04:10:27.590 --> 04:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
we discussed that when we passed initial
 
04:10:29.349 --> 04:10:29.359 align:start position:0%
doing your local assessment there's no
 
04:10:30.790 --> 04:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
cost to it other than what you normally
 
04:10:30.800 --> 04:10:32.149 align:start position:0%
cost to it other than what you normally
do

04:10:32.149 --> 04:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:10:34.149 --> 04:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
at that time all those materials were
 
04:10:35.510 --> 04:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
available free
 
04:10:37.510 --> 04:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
online so where there's no cost for
 
04:10:42.149 --> 04:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
purchasing that that uh immigration test
 
04:10:44.070 --> 04:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
i meant now the district you have to
 
04:10:46.149 --> 04:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
gather that information and send it up
 
04:10:48.229 --> 04:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
to the to the state well you're going to
 
04:10:50.070 --> 04:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
have secretarial staff or administrative
 
04:10:51.269 --> 04:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
staff you're going to have to compile
 
04:10:53.189 --> 04:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
the results if that's what you're doing
 
04:10:54.790 --> 04:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
what you should be doing
 
04:10:56.790 --> 04:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
so it takes time
 
04:10:56.800 --> 04:10:57.670 align:start position:0%
so it takes time
so

04:10:57.670 --> 04:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:59.510 --> 04:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
so there is a cost to the local district
 
04:11:01.990 --> 04:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
for doing this
 
04:11:04.070 --> 04:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
time is money kind of an unfunded
 
04:11:17.750 --> 04:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:19.910 --> 04:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead did you have did you were you
 
04:11:23.030 --> 04:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
waiting for us uh diane um well i i have
 
04:11:24.550 --> 04:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
an answer to representative porter's
 
04:11:24.560 --> 04:11:25.429 align:start position:0%
an answer to representative porter's
question

04:11:25.429 --> 04:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:11:27.670 --> 04:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
um thankfully um
 
04:11:29.269 --> 04:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
due to representative tanner's
 
04:11:31.510 --> 04:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
initiative uh there was a book that i
 
04:11:33.110 --> 04:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
could review so
 
04:11:33.120 --> 04:11:35.269 align:start position:0%
could review so
um

04:11:35.269 --> 04:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:37.590 --> 04:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
so when i look at and again this is
 
04:11:40.070 --> 04:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
always my disclaimer one attorney's
 
04:11:41.510 --> 04:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
opinion you asked
 
04:11:42.870 --> 04:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
two attorneys and you'll get five
 
04:11:44.149 --> 04:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
different opinions
 
04:11:44.159 --> 04:11:44.870 align:start position:0%
different opinions
so

04:11:44.870 --> 04:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:47.590 --> 04:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
when you look at 189 colon 11. your
 
04:11:50.070 --> 04:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
question was it begins by saying in all
 
04:11:52.070 --> 04:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
public and private schools so then is
 
04:11:53.830 --> 04:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
the assessment equally applicable to
 
04:11:55.349 --> 04:11:55.359 align:start position:0%
private schools that's your question
 
04:11:58.149 --> 04:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
correct all right so when i look at this
 
04:11:59.830 --> 04:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
i think a reasonable interpretation
 
04:12:01.349 --> 04:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
based on the rules of statutory
 
04:12:01.359 --> 04:12:03.030 align:start position:0%
based on the rules of statutory
construction

04:12:03.030 --> 04:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
construction
 
04:12:05.750 --> 04:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
when you look at paragraph one it is
 
04:12:07.429 --> 04:12:07.439 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing public and private
 
04:12:09.590 --> 04:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
schools when you look at paragraph two
 
04:12:11.990 --> 04:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
and you'll see on page 448 in the yellow
 
04:12:14.229 --> 04:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
book paragraph two effective until july
 
04:12:17.670 --> 04:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
1st 2023 see also paragraph two below
 
04:12:19.030 --> 04:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
right that's recognizing the old
 
04:12:20.469 --> 04:12:20.479 align:start position:0%
language of the law and then the new
 
04:12:23.110 --> 04:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
language that will come into effect but
 
04:12:25.030 --> 04:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph two in either version starts
 
04:12:27.269 --> 04:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
out saying as a component of instruction
 
04:12:29.189 --> 04:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
under paragraph one
 
04:12:33.590 --> 04:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
so i would read it to be inclusive of
 
04:12:35.910 --> 04:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
the language in paragraph one applicable
 
04:12:38.630 --> 04:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
to public and private schools but again
 
04:12:41.110 --> 04:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
i go back to my disclaimer
 
04:12:43.030 --> 04:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
one lawyer's opinion
 
04:12:45.189 --> 04:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
and that's that's all this is but i
 
04:12:47.189 --> 04:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
think that's a reasonable interpretation
 
04:12:50.550 --> 04:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
based on statutory construction
 
04:12:52.790 --> 04:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
question represent cordelia uh yes i i
 
04:12:54.630 --> 04:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
don't think that
 
04:12:56.550 --> 04:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
whether this applies to public or
 
04:12:58.389 --> 04:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
private schools
 
04:12:59.510 --> 04:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
or both
 
04:13:02.790 --> 04:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
is any part of this bill or the
 
04:13:02.800 --> 04:13:07.349 align:start position:0%
is any part of this bill or the
amendment

04:13:07.349 --> 04:13:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:09.590 --> 04:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
right and it and if i could answer the
 
04:13:11.510 --> 04:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
other question about
 
04:13:13.269 --> 04:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
time to do it
 
04:13:16.309 --> 04:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
this is already in law effective july 1
 
04:13:16.319 --> 04:13:17.670 align:start position:0%
this is already in law effective july 1
2023

04:13:17.670 --> 04:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
2023
 
04:13:17.680 --> 04:13:18.710 align:start position:0%
2023
so

04:13:18.710 --> 04:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:13:22.389 --> 04:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
all we are doing is in this amendment is
 
04:13:25.189 --> 04:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
providing accommodations for students
 
04:13:28.149 --> 04:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
and saying that not both
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
test results have to be sent to the
 
04:13:32.790 --> 04:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
department just this u s citizenship
 
04:13:34.469 --> 04:13:34.479 align:start position:0%
test results
 
04:13:37.510 --> 04:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
and i believe that that amendment was
 
04:13:39.269 --> 04:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
suggested on behalf of the department of
 
04:13:41.510 --> 04:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
education and and i apologize because i
 
04:13:43.110 --> 04:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
was out in the hall my boss was calling
 
04:13:45.030 --> 04:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
me but i i think that that was part of a
 
04:13:46.550 --> 04:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
discussion that the department brought
 
04:13:48.710 --> 04:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
forward um based on some current
 
04:13:50.309 --> 04:13:50.319 align:start position:0%
concerns of the bill that was passed
 
04:13:50.319 --> 04:13:51.590 align:start position:0%
concerns of the bill that was passed
previously

04:13:51.590 --> 04:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
previously
 
04:13:55.830 --> 04:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
so this was to to clarify some issues
 
04:13:57.910 --> 04:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
further discussion represented woodcock
 
04:13:59.510 --> 04:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you attorney thank you tell me
 
04:14:01.590 --> 04:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
what the department does
 
04:14:03.750 --> 04:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
with the data that's going to come from
 
04:14:05.750 --> 04:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
from specifically just this one test
 
04:14:05.760 --> 04:14:06.550 align:start position:0%
from specifically just this one test
that's

04:14:06.550 --> 04:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:14:08.389 --> 04:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
computerized online and the answers are
 
04:14:10.469 --> 04:14:10.479 align:start position:0%
there what valid validity would we send
 
04:14:13.830 --> 04:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:13.840 --> 04:14:15.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:14:15.830 --> 04:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:17.910 --> 04:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
i think there's really two parts to your
 
04:14:19.750 --> 04:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
question what does the department do
 
04:14:20.710 --> 04:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
with it
 
04:14:23.910 --> 04:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
we collect it we will maintain it it
 
04:14:26.389 --> 04:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
will be available for inspection your
 
04:14:28.550 --> 04:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
other question the validity of it is
 
04:14:32.870 --> 04:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:32.880 --> 04:14:33.670 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:14:33.670 --> 04:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:14:37.110 --> 04:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
that is more of a attorney answer
 
04:14:39.189 --> 04:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
committee answer
 
04:14:40.710 --> 04:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
right the department does not make those
 
04:14:42.710 --> 04:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
policy decisions thank you troy thank
 
04:14:42.720 --> 04:14:44.550 align:start position:0%
policy decisions thank you troy thank
you

04:14:44.550 --> 04:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:14:46.389 --> 04:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
represent mullin
 
04:14:48.070 --> 04:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:14:50.950 --> 04:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question attorney so as a
 
04:14:53.590 --> 04:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
component of instruction under paragraph
 
04:14:56.710 --> 04:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
one public and private the last
 
04:14:59.349 --> 04:14:59.359 align:start position:0%
statement in this amendment says by june
 
04:15:01.590 --> 04:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
30th of each year each school district
 
04:15:03.990 --> 04:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
shall submit the results
 
04:15:05.750 --> 04:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
to the doe
 
04:15:08.149 --> 04:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
would that um would this compel private
 
04:15:09.990 --> 04:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
schools to also
 
04:15:12.870 --> 04:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
send results to the doe
 
04:15:12.880 --> 04:15:15.670 align:start position:0%
send results to the doe
no

04:15:15.670 --> 04:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:18.469 --> 04:15:18.479 align:start position:0%
no i think school district has yeah
 
04:15:22.149 --> 04:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:22.159 --> 04:15:23.510 align:start position:0%
 
terminology

04:15:23.510 --> 04:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
terminology
 
04:15:25.030 --> 04:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say words are important
 
04:15:26.630 --> 04:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
because i think that's uh i don't want
 
04:15:29.030 --> 04:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
to step into your shoes but terminology
 
04:15:31.110 --> 04:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
and consistency of terminology is
 
04:15:32.790 --> 04:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
something that we at the department are
 
04:15:34.229 --> 04:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
always working on
 
04:15:35.670 --> 04:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
if you look at our rules we struggle
 
04:15:37.910 --> 04:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
with that and we have really tried to
 
04:15:39.910 --> 04:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
take the initiative to to address that
 
04:15:42.469 --> 04:15:42.479 align:start position:0%
terminology issue and i think we see
 
04:15:45.110 --> 04:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
that throughout the statutes and
 
04:15:47.030 --> 04:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
certainly in our rules and in in our own
 
04:15:49.590 --> 04:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
vocabulary i i find myself having to do
 
04:15:51.670 --> 04:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
that as well so certainly something to
 
04:15:53.670 --> 04:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
be aware of
 
04:15:55.189 --> 04:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
represent tanner
 
04:15:57.750 --> 04:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um i'm struggling with the
 
04:15:59.510 --> 04:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill as i think some of
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
the other questions that you've heard
 
04:16:03.510 --> 04:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
from the committee kind of go around why
 
04:16:04.950 --> 04:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden does the state
 
04:16:07.750 --> 04:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
department decide that they need
 
04:16:07.760 --> 04:16:08.870 align:start position:0%
department decide that they need
to

04:16:08.870 --> 04:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:16:10.469 --> 04:16:10.479 align:start position:0%
have school districts provide this
 
04:16:13.429 --> 04:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
information and you remarked that
 
04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
there were some concerns
 
04:16:17.910 --> 04:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
so maybe if you could talk about some of
 
04:16:19.990 --> 04:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
the concerns maybe the intent would be a
 
04:16:22.870 --> 04:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
little bit more clear to me
 
04:16:25.030 --> 04:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question
 
04:16:25.040 --> 04:16:27.590 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question
um

04:16:27.590 --> 04:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:31.269 --> 04:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
the concerns are not about
 
04:16:33.030 --> 04:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
the policy
 
04:16:35.830 --> 04:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
initiatives the concerns are about this
 
04:16:38.389 --> 04:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
bill was passed last session
 
04:16:40.630 --> 04:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
and when the department goes to
 
04:16:40.640 --> 04:16:42.149 align:start position:0%
and when the department goes to
implement

04:16:42.149 --> 04:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
implement
 
04:16:43.349 --> 04:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
the law
 
04:16:45.349 --> 04:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
um those are that's when the concerns
 
04:16:45.359 --> 04:16:46.309 align:start position:0%
um those are that's when the concerns
arise

04:16:46.309 --> 04:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
arise
 
04:16:48.550 --> 04:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
um those are when those
 
04:16:50.950 --> 04:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
discrepancies are discovered
 
04:16:53.269 --> 04:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
because you can you can write a bill you
 
04:16:55.030 --> 04:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
can write a law and then when you
 
04:16:57.670 --> 04:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
implement it and really test it that's
 
04:16:58.950 --> 04:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
when you'll find those inherent
 
04:17:00.870 --> 04:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
discrepancies and i think that is what
 
04:17:03.269 --> 04:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
nate greene testified to is that in
 
04:17:04.630 --> 04:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
implementing the law there were just
 
04:17:07.349 --> 04:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
some issues and we felt as a department
 
04:17:07.359 --> 04:17:08.630 align:start position:0%
some issues and we felt as a department
that

04:17:08.630 --> 04:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:17:10.870 --> 04:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
there could be some corrections made to
 
04:17:13.110 --> 04:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
in order to implement but the department
 
04:17:15.030 --> 04:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't bring those forward
 
04:17:17.750 --> 04:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
to correct policy
 
04:17:20.630 --> 04:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
that is done by this committee so if
 
04:17:22.790 --> 04:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
that helps to
 
04:17:24.469 --> 04:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
clarify that
 
04:17:24.479 --> 04:17:26.710 align:start position:0%
clarify that
yes

04:17:26.710 --> 04:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:17:26.720 --> 04:17:28.950 align:start position:0%
yes
so

04:17:28.950 --> 04:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
i think it made a little bit less clear
 
04:17:33.189 --> 04:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
to me what the intent is or what the
 
04:17:35.750 --> 04:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
concerns are
 
04:17:37.510 --> 04:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
because it's a requirement for
 
04:17:37.520 --> 04:17:39.189 align:start position:0%
because it's a requirement for
graduation

04:17:39.189 --> 04:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
graduation
 
04:17:40.630 --> 04:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh this test
 
04:17:40.640 --> 04:17:42.149 align:start position:0%
uh this test
and

04:17:42.149 --> 04:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:17:45.110 --> 04:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
so the requirements for graduation
 
04:17:47.030 --> 04:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
are approved by the local school board
 
04:17:48.950 --> 04:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
at the local level
 
04:17:50.469 --> 04:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
that they they're the ones that
 
04:17:52.790 --> 04:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
certified whether a student actually
 
04:17:54.790 --> 04:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
meets all those requirements
 
04:17:58.070 --> 04:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
for graduation so
 
04:17:59.750 --> 04:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
is this like a
 
04:18:02.229 --> 04:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
gotcha for local school districts or is
 
04:18:05.189 --> 04:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
it a way to
 
04:18:07.830 --> 04:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
indicate and as uh representative
 
04:18:10.550 --> 04:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
woodcock said you know all the answers
 
04:18:11.990 --> 04:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
are online so
 
04:18:14.309 --> 04:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
actually it should be 100
 
04:18:16.309 --> 04:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
04:18:18.950 --> 04:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
responses from from kids if they can
 
04:18:21.030 --> 04:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
just go online and find all the answers
 
04:18:21.040 --> 04:18:22.070 align:start position:0%
just go online and find all the answers
anyway

04:18:22.070 --> 04:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
04:18:22.080 --> 04:18:23.030 align:start position:0%
anyway
so

04:18:23.030 --> 04:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:18:23.040 --> 04:18:23.830 align:start position:0%
so
i

04:18:23.830 --> 04:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:18:26.469 --> 04:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
i'm still confused about
 
04:18:28.070 --> 04:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
what are the concerns in the intent with
 
04:18:28.080 --> 04:18:29.189 align:start position:0%
what are the concerns in the intent with
the

04:18:29.189 --> 04:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:18:31.110 --> 04:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
implementation of the
 
04:18:33.030 --> 04:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
are you feeling like not all schools are
 
04:18:34.950 --> 04:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
doing it um
 
04:18:37.110 --> 04:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
you know what exactly is it i don't
 
04:18:37.120 --> 04:18:38.389 align:start position:0%
you know what exactly is it i don't
understand

04:18:38.389 --> 04:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
understand
 
04:18:40.870 --> 04:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
oh well in my apologies i don't have the
 
04:18:43.189 --> 04:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
current amendment in front of me um what
 
04:18:45.990 --> 04:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
i can tell you in broad terms
 
04:18:48.870 --> 04:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
this was um again when the department
 
04:18:50.790 --> 04:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
went to implement this bill which was
 
04:18:53.830 --> 04:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
passed last session is my understanding
 
04:18:57.590 --> 04:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:00.149 --> 04:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
the implementation of it and we
 
04:19:02.950 --> 04:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
identified some areas as i think it
 
04:19:04.389 --> 04:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
pertained to special ed i know there's
 
04:19:06.309 --> 04:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
some language in there about that and
 
04:19:08.389 --> 04:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
just in terms of how it's going to be
 
04:19:10.550 --> 04:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
applied throughout the state
 
04:19:10.560 --> 04:19:11.349 align:start position:0%
applied throughout the state
uh

04:19:11.349 --> 04:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:19:13.110 --> 04:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
equally to all school districts it was
 
04:19:15.189 --> 04:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
never intended to be a gotcha but this
 
04:19:17.189 --> 04:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
was in order to implement this and in
 
04:19:19.269 --> 04:19:19.279 align:start position:0%
order to effectuate the purpose of this
 
04:19:19.279 --> 04:19:20.870 align:start position:0%
order to effectuate the purpose of this
law

04:19:20.870 --> 04:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:19:22.630 --> 04:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
we identified we as a department
 
04:19:24.070 --> 04:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
identified some areas that we felt
 
04:19:26.309 --> 04:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
needed some clarity and that's what the
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
intent of that was bringing it forward
 
04:19:28.080 --> 04:19:28.830 align:start position:0%
intent of that was bringing it forward
it

04:19:28.830 --> 04:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:19:31.750 --> 04:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
was to rectify some issues that we saw
 
04:19:33.189 --> 04:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
with a bill that had been previously
 
04:19:35.830 --> 04:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
passed um and
 
04:19:36.950 --> 04:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
we've done that
 
04:19:40.309 --> 04:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
with in other areas with other bills
 
04:19:40.319 --> 04:19:41.670 align:start position:0%
with in other areas with other bills
representative

04:19:41.670 --> 04:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:19:44.469 --> 04:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
thank you um if we could get back maybe
 
04:19:44.479 --> 04:19:45.269 align:start position:0%
thank you um if we could get back maybe
to

04:19:45.269 --> 04:19:45.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:19:46.469 --> 04:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:19:47.990 --> 04:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
and the amendment
 
04:19:50.710 --> 04:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
this is in current statute
 
04:19:54.309 --> 04:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
um you know on page 448 in your book
 
04:19:56.630 --> 04:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
this is all in current statute
 
04:19:59.910 --> 04:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
the original bill does two things
 
04:20:03.510 --> 04:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
it puts in the accommodations as um
 
04:20:05.830 --> 04:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
attorney fenton just mentioned terms of
 
04:20:07.670 --> 04:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
special needs children
 
04:20:10.070 --> 04:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
and it said that both the local
 
04:20:12.550 --> 04:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
assessment and the us test had to be
 
04:20:14.870 --> 04:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
submitted to the department
 
04:20:18.229 --> 04:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
it's already in law that
 
04:20:18.239 --> 04:20:19.510 align:start position:0%
it's already in law that
orr

04:20:19.510 --> 04:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
orr
 
04:20:21.189 --> 04:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
is in law now
 
04:20:23.510 --> 04:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
the original bill says both
 
04:20:26.630 --> 04:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
the amendment based on the hearing
 
04:20:26.640 --> 04:20:27.590 align:start position:0%
the amendment based on the hearing
says

04:20:27.590 --> 04:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
says
 
04:20:28.950 --> 04:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
not both
 
04:20:29.990 --> 04:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
not or
 
04:20:32.389 --> 04:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
just the us citizenship test has to be
 
04:20:34.070 --> 04:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
sent to the department those are the
 
04:20:35.990 --> 04:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
only two things the bill and the
 
04:20:37.910 --> 04:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
amendment does it has
 
04:20:39.750 --> 04:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with whether it's public
 
04:20:41.429 --> 04:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
or private schools
 
04:20:43.670 --> 04:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with
 
04:20:43.680 --> 04:20:44.469 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with
the

04:20:44.469 --> 04:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:20:46.710 --> 04:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
the test itself or number of questions
 
04:20:48.630 --> 04:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
or the scores or anything else none of
 
04:20:51.349 --> 04:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
that is in this bill
 
04:20:52.830 --> 04:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
if i
 
04:20:56.149 --> 04:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
may i think that
 
04:20:58.389 --> 04:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
that language was recommended because
 
04:21:00.870 --> 04:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
the department identified
 
04:21:02.790 --> 04:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
the difficulty of the the local
 
04:21:04.790 --> 04:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
assessment going back to representative
 
04:21:06.790 --> 04:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
lad's original comment
 
04:21:06.800 --> 04:21:07.750 align:start position:0%
lad's original comment
that

04:21:07.750 --> 04:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:21:10.469 --> 04:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
there was a lack of consistency in what
 
04:21:12.710 --> 04:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
the department could report out on if
 
04:21:14.630 --> 04:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
there are all these local locally
 
04:21:16.469 --> 04:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
developed assessments and i know that
 
04:21:18.550 --> 04:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
was part of the discussion as we um
 
04:21:21.510 --> 04:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
crafted this back in the fall
 
04:21:23.750 --> 04:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
and then there was also the concern
 
04:21:23.760 --> 04:21:25.590 align:start position:0%
and then there was also the concern
about

04:21:25.590 --> 04:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:21:27.510 --> 04:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
providing the accommodations
 
04:21:29.429 --> 04:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
04:21:31.189 --> 04:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
we the department viewed this as a
 
04:21:32.870 --> 04:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
cleanup bill to address some concerns
 
04:21:34.870 --> 04:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
and implementation of the law that was
 
04:21:37.429 --> 04:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
previously passed and that was that was
 
04:21:38.790 --> 04:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
the only
 
04:21:41.349 --> 04:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
reason behind it thank you
 
04:21:43.349 --> 04:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
further yes representative ellison thank
 
04:21:45.429 --> 04:21:45.439 align:start position:0%

04:21:52.630 --> 04:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh lines 15 well line 14
 
04:21:54.630 --> 04:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
and 15
 
04:21:57.429 --> 04:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
each school district shall submit is it

04:22:04.870 --> 04:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with my
 
04:22:07.269 --> 04:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
interpretation um the attorney has
 
04:22:09.189 --> 04:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
talked about her interpretation of the
 
04:22:09.199 --> 04:22:11.510 align:start position:0%
talked about her interpretation of the
law

04:22:11.510 --> 04:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
the intent with the amendment was to
 
04:22:15.750 --> 04:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
address only
 
04:22:15.760 --> 04:22:16.630 align:start position:0%
address only
that

04:22:16.630 --> 04:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:22:16.640 --> 04:22:19.510 align:start position:0%
that
justice

04:22:19.510 --> 04:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:21.349 --> 04:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing that i addressed
 
04:22:23.990 --> 04:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
in the amendment based on testimony in
 
04:22:27.110 --> 04:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on the bill
 
04:22:28.149 --> 04:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:22:30.950 --> 04:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
and i'll address this to attorney fenton
 
04:22:34.070 --> 04:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh line 15 each school district shall
 
04:22:36.469 --> 04:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
submit the results in your reading that
 
04:22:39.990 --> 04:22:40.000 align:start position:0%

talking about and representative mullen
 
04:22:55.429 --> 04:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
was talking about
 
04:22:58.149 --> 04:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
and and how the the terms
 
04:23:00.469 --> 04:23:00.479 align:start position:0%

04:23:06.790 --> 04:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
is used and the term public i'm sorry a
 
04:23:08.550 --> 04:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
school district
 
04:23:11.670 --> 04:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
is also used all within paragraph one
 
04:23:13.189 --> 04:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:23:17.110 --> 04:23:17.120 align:start position:0%

terms refer to the same things or or
 
04:23:29.269 --> 04:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
different things
 
04:23:31.590 --> 04:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
um or is it or or is that or is this
 
04:23:35.030 --> 04:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
basically a fielder's choice use of um
 
04:23:38.149 --> 04:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
use of terms to um to essentially refer
 
04:23:41.990 --> 04:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:43.269 --> 04:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm wondering i'm wondering about
 
04:23:45.510 --> 04:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
the legislative intent whether it was
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
deliberate to uh to somehow see a break
 
04:23:50.950 --> 04:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
there given the fact that that so many
 
04:23:53.349 --> 04:23:53.359 align:start position:0%
different terms that refer to the same
 
04:23:56.630 --> 04:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
thing are being used in paragraph one
 
04:23:58.710 --> 04:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
and i think this is relevant to the
 
04:24:01.269 --> 04:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
amendment and to the bill because it uh
 
04:24:04.070 --> 04:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
it certainly relates to the scope of um
 
04:24:06.389 --> 04:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
of applicability but you're trying to
 
04:24:09.269 --> 04:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
ask us if it's our the department
 
04:24:09.279 --> 04:24:10.550 align:start position:0%
ask us if it's our the department
whether

04:24:10.550 --> 04:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
whether
 
04:24:12.469 --> 04:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
what you're asking for is relevant what
 
04:24:15.189 --> 04:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
you're asking for has no relationship
 
04:24:17.830 --> 04:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
with the amendment
 
04:24:20.790 --> 04:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
it does by the virtue of the scope
 
04:24:24.149 --> 04:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
because if it turns out that that these
 
04:24:26.309 --> 04:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
are terms that all refer to the same
 
04:24:28.309 --> 04:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
thing then that would that would
 
04:24:30.309 --> 04:24:30.319 align:start position:0%
certainly flow down through into
 
04:24:32.870 --> 04:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph two as it does
 
04:24:35.030 --> 04:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
intentionally in the top of paragraph
 
04:24:36.950 --> 04:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
two as a component of instruction under
 
04:24:38.870 --> 04:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph one
 
04:24:40.790 --> 04:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
and and what the amendment and what the
 
04:24:44.469 --> 04:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
underlying bill do is modify some words
 
04:24:44.479 --> 04:24:45.429 align:start position:0%
underlying bill do is modify some words
um

04:24:45.429 --> 04:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:47.670 --> 04:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
in paragraph two so i think the scope is
 
04:24:50.229 --> 04:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely relevant to knowing what
 
04:24:52.550 --> 04:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
we're getting into here
 
04:24:55.349 --> 04:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
mr chairman the scope is not
 
04:24:58.229 --> 04:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
um altered in any way
 
04:25:00.630 --> 04:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
um by the uh
 
04:25:03.750 --> 04:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
by the amendment or by the main bill
 
04:25:05.429 --> 04:25:05.439 align:start position:0%
um you know i
 
04:25:06.870 --> 04:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know i i'm not going to repeat
 
04:25:09.269 --> 04:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
myself for the fourth time but you know
 
04:25:10.790 --> 04:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's 1 30.
 
04:25:12.630 --> 04:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
under school improvement and assessment
 
04:25:15.110 --> 04:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
it mentions district and that's relevant
 
04:25:17.670 --> 04:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
to the school districts which are public
 
04:25:20.309 --> 04:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
school districts in our state has
 
04:25:22.870 --> 04:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with private schools when
 
04:25:24.309 --> 04:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
it comes to improvement and assessment
 
04:25:26.229 --> 04:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
that's not our game to go in and assess
 
04:25:28.309 --> 04:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
those private schools unless they want
 
04:25:29.590 --> 04:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
to be an approved school and they've
 
04:25:31.030 --> 04:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
come to the department and asked for
 
04:25:33.670 --> 04:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
that approval so at this point in time i
 
04:25:35.269 --> 04:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
think it's time to call this question we
 
04:25:36.870 --> 04:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
have a lot to do today and we're going
 
04:25:38.309 --> 04:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
to be here to seven o'clock eight
 
04:25:40.070 --> 04:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
o'clock if we have to to get this done
 
04:25:43.189 --> 04:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
we cannot meet tomorrow it's not posted
 
04:25:45.750 --> 04:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
for tomorrow we can't continue this to
 
04:25:50.550 --> 04:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:50.560 --> 04:25:51.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:25:51.990 --> 04:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:25:54.070 --> 04:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
i'd like to move forward here
 
04:25:57.910 --> 04:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:59.990 --> 04:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a motion on that
 
04:26:01.750 --> 04:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
on the table we have an amendment that's
 
04:26:05.229 --> 04:26:05.239 align:start position:0%
been proposed that's hp 1360 excuse me
 
04:26:12.630 --> 04:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:15.189 --> 04:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
and let's see we've already
 
04:26:18.630 --> 04:26:18.640 align:start position:0%

was introduced is not there
 
04:31:56.950 --> 04:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
first of all this has changed the
 
04:31:58.870 --> 04:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh location
 
04:32:01.910 --> 04:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
within law that we've been addressing
 
04:32:07.429 --> 04:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
uh to 186 colon 11 roman 9
 
04:32:07.439 --> 04:32:08.790 align:start position:0%
uh to 186 colon 11 roman 9
c

04:32:08.790 --> 04:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
c
 
04:32:11.189 --> 04:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
and this is an area within law which we
 
04:32:14.149 --> 04:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
have which deals with the sentence
 
04:32:17.349 --> 04:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
currently says to the extent practicable
 
04:32:19.110 --> 04:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
a school district shall make curriculum
 
04:32:20.790 --> 04:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
materials available to parents or legal
 
04:32:24.229 --> 04:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
guardians for review upon request
 
04:32:25.910 --> 04:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
and we're talking in this about
 
04:32:28.149 --> 04:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
curriculum course materials used for
 
04:32:28.159 --> 04:32:30.550 align:start position:0%
curriculum course materials used for
instruction

04:32:30.550 --> 04:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
04:32:33.110 --> 04:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
and so this amendment goes to read now
 
04:32:35.349 --> 04:32:35.359 align:start position:0%
to the extent practicable
 
04:32:37.750 --> 04:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
and upon request from a parent legal
 
04:32:39.510 --> 04:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
guardian or resident of the public
 
04:32:41.269 --> 04:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
school district to review curriculum
 
04:32:43.429 --> 04:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
course material used to support student
 
04:32:45.110 --> 04:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
learning in a grade level course or
 
04:32:47.110 --> 04:32:47.120 align:start position:0%

business days
 
04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's a response to parents who are
 
04:32:58.790 --> 04:32:58.800 align:start position:0%

and to the in in the past it's been to
 
04:33:05.349 --> 04:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
the extent practical and of course
 
04:33:06.869 --> 04:33:06.879 align:start position:0%
you might have a whole boatload of
 
04:33:09.029 --> 04:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
materials which you cannot duplicate you
 
04:33:11.109 --> 04:33:11.119 align:start position:0%
can't replicate and and you're gonna
 
04:33:12.551 --> 04:33:12.561 align:start position:0%
have to make arrangements to have that
 
04:33:14.629 --> 04:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
done however for many things which
 
04:33:17.510 --> 04:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum is written down that you have
 
04:33:20.070 --> 04:33:20.080 align:start position:0%

something that i used two weeks ago

worksheet i made up for example or that
 
04:34:16.869 --> 04:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
sort of thing i would need to keep it so
 
04:34:18.310 --> 04:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
that it could be available two weeks
 
04:34:20.390 --> 04:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
later for a parent to see
 
04:34:22.230 --> 04:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
if a parent comes in and says i want to
 
04:34:23.910 --> 04:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
see your social study materials that
 
04:34:25.189 --> 04:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
you're using in your classroom that
 
04:34:27.029 --> 04:34:27.039 align:start position:0%
could be any time
 
04:34:29.269 --> 04:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't have it's it's upon the
 
04:34:31.189 --> 04:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
moment they're requesting so from that
 
04:34:32.629 --> 04:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
point forward
 
04:34:34.709 --> 04:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
first of all i as a teacher would sit
 
04:34:36.470 --> 04:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
down with that parent say or that
 
04:34:38.551 --> 04:34:38.561 align:start position:0%
request or it could be a legal guardian
 
04:34:41.029 --> 04:34:41.039 align:start position:0%
or whatever it says in here
 
04:34:43.349 --> 04:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh resident of the district it's not
 
04:34:45.109 --> 04:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
just any anybody that can come in and
 
04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
ask for this stuff they sit down talk
 
04:34:49.189 --> 04:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
about it and then uh
 
04:34:51.349 --> 04:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
facilitate what that parent's asking for
 
04:34:54.390 --> 04:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
in in conformance with this right here
 
04:34:56.150 --> 04:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
which is your curriculum course
 
04:34:59.910 --> 04:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
materials which those are already in law
 
04:35:01.029 --> 04:35:01.039 align:start position:0%
and where
 
04:35:01.039 --> 04:35:06.150 align:start position:0%
and where
practicable

04:35:06.150 --> 04:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:11.750 --> 04:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh scene none um
 
04:35:13.830 --> 04:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
04:35:15.910 --> 04:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
we had um
 
04:35:18.629 --> 04:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
a person come in who was very disturbed
 
04:35:20.551 --> 04:35:20.561 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:35:20.561 --> 04:35:21.349 align:start position:0%
that um
or

04:35:21.349 --> 04:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:35:23.830 --> 04:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
i i can't remember if the person was or
 
04:35:25.109 --> 04:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
had heard this
 
04:35:26.949 --> 04:35:26.959 align:start position:0%
that somebody was actually getting a
 
04:35:29.029 --> 04:35:29.039 align:start position:0%
call from the local police about a
 
04:35:30.470 --> 04:35:30.480 align:start position:0%

04:35:32.949 --> 04:35:32.959 align:start position:0%
for constantly approaching a school
 
04:35:32.959 --> 04:35:34.551 align:start position:0%
for constantly approaching a school
district

04:35:34.551 --> 04:35:34.561 align:start position:0%
district
 
04:35:36.310 --> 04:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
for curriculum materials course
 
04:35:38.629 --> 04:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
materials and i'm wondering if
 
04:35:41.109 --> 04:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
if there's a cap on this or if it's only
 
04:35:41.119 --> 04:35:41.990 align:start position:0%
if there's a cap on this or if it's only
for

04:35:41.990 --> 04:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:35:44.310 --> 04:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
like you said it can't be just somebody
 
04:35:46.150 --> 04:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
coming in it had to be somebody in the
 
04:35:49.510 --> 04:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
school district or a parent or
 
04:35:51.510 --> 04:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
does it have to be a parent of a child
 
04:35:53.349 --> 04:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
in the school
 
04:35:53.359 --> 04:35:54.070 align:start position:0%
in the school
and

04:35:54.070 --> 04:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:35:55.990 --> 04:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
can it just refer to the
 
04:35:58.230 --> 04:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
04:36:03.429 --> 04:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:05.990 --> 04:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
oh is there any kind of i i would just
 
04:36:08.390 --> 04:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
say that uh on line 16 it says the
 
04:36:10.310 --> 04:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
parent legal guardian or resident of the
 
04:36:10.320 --> 04:36:11.590 align:start position:0%
parent legal guardian or resident of the
district

04:36:11.590 --> 04:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
district
 
04:36:13.750 --> 04:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if representative vlad
 
04:36:14.949 --> 04:36:14.959 align:start position:0%
has any further
 
04:36:17.510 --> 04:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
comment on that well we we we had taken
 
04:36:19.510 --> 04:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
in account that and i think in some of
 
04:36:20.869 --> 04:36:20.879 align:start position:0%
our previous
 
04:36:23.349 --> 04:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
amendments which we've had it was wide
 
04:36:25.990 --> 04:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
open this is specific to
 
04:36:27.750 --> 04:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
and this is not an uncommon thing which
 
04:36:29.590 --> 04:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
occurs you know you
 
04:36:31.670 --> 04:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
i would encourage parents to come in and
 
04:36:35.269 --> 04:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
and ask what are we doing um
 
04:36:36.789 --> 04:36:36.799 align:start position:0%
wonderful way to do the homework and
 
04:36:38.709 --> 04:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
help out at home
 
04:36:40.070 --> 04:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
so i
 
04:36:42.150 --> 04:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
i think that this is
 
04:36:45.109 --> 04:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
in alignment with what we have been
 
04:36:47.189 --> 04:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
doing i don't see anything only what
 
04:36:49.029 --> 04:36:49.039 align:start position:0%
this does is basically it puts in a
 
04:36:50.551 --> 04:36:50.561 align:start position:0%
place that it's going to be done within
 
04:36:52.789 --> 04:36:52.799 align:start position:0%
10 days after you you've had that
 
04:36:55.029 --> 04:36:55.039 align:start position:0%
contact from the individual requesting
 
04:36:55.039 --> 04:36:56.230 align:start position:0%
contact from the individual requesting
it

04:36:56.230 --> 04:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:36:59.189 --> 04:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
can i have a follow-up to that
 
04:37:02.230 --> 04:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
so i i i just um you know from what we
 
04:37:04.150 --> 04:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
heard there were people within the
 
04:37:05.670 --> 04:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
school district that were coming in and
 
04:37:08.629 --> 04:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
asking for curriculum course materials
 
04:37:08.639 --> 04:37:10.789 align:start position:0%
asking for curriculum course materials
uh

04:37:10.789 --> 04:37:10.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:37:13.109 --> 04:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
who were not had did really didn't have
 
04:37:15.429 --> 04:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
a vested interest to do that i mean i
 
04:37:18.310 --> 04:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
can see parents having a vested interest
 
04:37:21.670 --> 04:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
coming in and and as you said you know
 
04:37:23.910 --> 04:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
in the 35 years i taught i talked to
 
04:37:26.629 --> 04:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
many parents and
 
04:37:28.390 --> 04:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
you know set out course materials for
 
04:37:29.670 --> 04:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
that too but
 
04:37:29.680 --> 04:37:31.029 align:start position:0%
that too but
um

04:37:31.029 --> 04:37:31.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:33.109 --> 04:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
i'm just kind of concerned that
 
04:37:35.750 --> 04:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
you know i don't want to open
 
04:37:38.390 --> 04:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
open this up to okay it has to be you
 
04:37:39.830 --> 04:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
know show us all your curriculum
 
04:37:41.830 --> 04:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
materials because i live in the district
 
04:37:43.990 --> 04:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
and um you know
 
04:37:46.551 --> 04:37:46.561 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to do with it so i i
 
04:37:49.429 --> 04:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
think that in response that there
 
04:37:51.910 --> 04:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
this says they uh make available the
 
04:37:54.949 --> 04:37:54.959 align:start position:0%
reques excuse me the district shall make
 
04:37:57.429 --> 04:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
available it doesn't say the teacher the
 
04:37:58.949 --> 04:37:58.959 align:start position:0%
district's going to have to develop a
 
04:38:01.510 --> 04:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
policy in how to implement this
 
04:38:03.429 --> 04:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
they may want you to come in first and
 
04:38:05.109 --> 04:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
talk maybe to the teacher or maybe the
 
04:38:06.789 --> 04:38:06.799 align:start position:0%
prince building principle
 
04:38:08.869 --> 04:38:08.879 align:start position:0%
and the district may have these
 
04:38:11.510 --> 04:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
materials at a location somewhere
 
04:38:13.109 --> 04:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the district which they
 
04:38:14.629 --> 04:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
come yeah we got that available in the
 
04:38:16.310 --> 04:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
media center come on in you're welcome
 
04:38:18.230 --> 04:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
to look at it but it's available to
 
04:38:20.789 --> 04:38:20.799 align:start position:0%
anybody in that district a resident of
 
04:38:23.029 --> 04:38:23.039 align:start position:0%
that public school district
 
04:38:24.949 --> 04:38:24.959 align:start position:0%
and there are taxpayers that would like
 
04:38:28.310 --> 04:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
to see times what what is in the school
 
04:38:29.910 --> 04:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
and being used for curriculum materials
 
04:38:32.390 --> 04:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's i think that's a right to access
 
04:38:34.869 --> 04:38:34.879 align:start position:0%
that material
 
04:38:36.390 --> 04:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
represent luna
 
04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair um just a
 
04:38:40.230 --> 04:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
question that sort of bridges over from
 
04:38:42.470 --> 04:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
what representative porter was asking
 
04:38:45.269 --> 04:38:45.279 align:start position:0%
and what representative tanner was
 
04:38:47.109 --> 04:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
asking but let's say that in
 
04:38:49.429 --> 04:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
representative porter's classroom
 
04:38:50.789 --> 04:38:50.799 align:start position:0%
she um
 
04:38:52.470 --> 04:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
she does a couple of things
 
04:38:55.910 --> 04:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
she um she has her students watch a um
 
04:38:58.629 --> 04:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
uh a 20 or a a
 
04:39:01.029 --> 04:39:01.039 align:start position:0%
a um i don't know a five-minute segment
 
04:39:05.910 --> 04:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
on uh on cnn uh with regards to ukraine
 
04:39:09.990 --> 04:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
and then um and then uh hands out a um
 
04:39:15.269 --> 04:39:15.279 align:start position:0%
a worksheet that that she's developed um
 
04:39:15.279 --> 04:39:16.709 align:start position:0%
a worksheet that that she's developed um
what

04:39:16.709 --> 04:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:39:21.109 --> 04:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
of of of at least those two materials
 
04:39:23.590 --> 04:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
what would need to be
 
04:39:23.600 --> 04:39:26.150 align:start position:0%
what would need to be
presented

04:39:26.150 --> 04:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
presented
 
04:39:27.750 --> 04:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
for review
 
04:39:29.990 --> 04:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
within 10 business days following a
 
04:39:33.349 --> 04:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
request well we do have within 8306
 
04:39:35.750 --> 04:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
definition of resources and materials we
 
04:39:37.990 --> 04:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
do have within statutory law definition
 
04:39:39.910 --> 04:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
of curriculum
 
04:39:41.670 --> 04:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
certainly if you're
 
04:39:41.680 --> 04:39:44.550 align:start position:0%
certainly if you're
teaching

04:39:44.550 --> 04:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:47.270 --> 04:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
current events in a upper elementary
 
04:39:49.430 --> 04:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
class intermediate school four through
 
04:39:49.440 --> 04:39:50.628 align:start position:0%
class intermediate school four through
six

04:39:50.628 --> 04:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
six
 
04:39:53.110 --> 04:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
and the old weekly reader you used to
 
04:39:56.150 --> 04:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
get in the mail numerous copies i know
 
04:39:57.750 --> 04:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
bill just left but he probably did it
 
04:40:00.150 --> 04:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
too i did it
 
04:40:02.628 --> 04:40:02.638 align:start position:0%
and the weekly reader's little newspaper
 
04:40:04.550 --> 04:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
that comes out and has current events in
 
04:40:06.708 --> 04:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
it that you know i would say that weekly
 
04:40:09.670 --> 04:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
reader is you know my um
 
04:40:11.750 --> 04:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
part of my curriculum materials i don't
 
04:40:13.750 --> 04:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
need to have every copy of weekly reader
 
04:40:16.390 --> 04:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
available uh that would certainly make
 
04:40:17.270 --> 04:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
it just
 
04:40:19.030 --> 04:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
that's not practical
 
04:40:23.110 --> 04:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
so i think we have some discretion here
 
04:40:25.030 --> 04:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you that's that's sort of what
 
04:40:27.750 --> 04:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
what i was looking for is that that term
 
04:40:33.590 --> 04:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:36.470 --> 04:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
any further yes representative porter
 
04:40:39.190 --> 04:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and
 
04:40:41.590 --> 04:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm just really concerned about
 
04:40:43.270 --> 04:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
the language in this bill that says
 
04:40:46.070 --> 04:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
anybody who lives in a school district
 
04:40:48.470 --> 04:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
can ask for these materials
 
04:40:51.990 --> 04:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
and i love the people in my district
 
04:40:54.628 --> 04:40:54.638 align:start position:0%
but sometimes
 
04:40:58.550 --> 04:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
there are unusual characters in the town
 
04:41:00.788 --> 04:41:00.798 align:start position:0%
and i can see that perhaps they would
 
04:41:02.628 --> 04:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
want to
 
04:41:04.470 --> 04:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
investigate and they have no children in
 
04:41:06.230 --> 04:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
the school they have no
 
04:41:07.510 --> 04:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
you know they're not worried about
 
04:41:09.270 --> 04:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
what's being said in the classroom but
 
04:41:11.430 --> 04:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
they know there's a topic out there
 
04:41:13.510 --> 04:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
that's hot and they maybe want to catch
 
04:41:15.830 --> 04:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
somebody doing it um and that they could
 
04:41:20.390 --> 04:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
just walk in and demand this material um
 
04:41:23.750 --> 04:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm no i'm hearing and i'm seeing
 
04:41:23.760 --> 04:41:24.788 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm no i'm hearing and i'm seeing
from

04:41:24.788 --> 04:41:24.798 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:41:27.830 --> 04:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
colleagues who are in the classroom now
 
04:41:29.590 --> 04:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
a real fear
 
04:41:31.830 --> 04:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
and a real concern
 
04:41:34.550 --> 04:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
many of them are talking about leaving
 
04:41:36.948 --> 04:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
the professional together because of the
 
04:41:39.750 --> 04:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
stresses that they're under
 
04:41:41.990 --> 04:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
we've passed bills that
 
04:41:43.910 --> 04:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
they're not sure what they can say in
 
04:41:45.270 --> 04:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
class and
 
04:41:47.270 --> 04:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
they're not sure what they can teach and
 
04:41:50.390 --> 04:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
what books they can give
 
04:41:52.390 --> 04:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
they're not sure about a lot of things
 
04:41:54.868 --> 04:41:54.878 align:start position:0%
and now to know that anybody
 
04:41:56.550 --> 04:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
could question what they're doing by
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
coming in and saying i demand to see
 
04:42:00.868 --> 04:42:00.878 align:start position:0%
what mary smith is doing in her
 
04:42:03.190 --> 04:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
classroom because i think i've heard
 
04:42:06.070 --> 04:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
something bad about her that scares me
 
04:42:07.670 --> 04:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
it scares me for them and for their
 
04:42:10.070 --> 04:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
safety so i'm i'm really concerned about
 
04:42:11.910 --> 04:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
that particular language
 
04:42:13.990 --> 04:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's not in the original statute i don't
 
04:42:14.000 --> 04:42:14.868 align:start position:0%
it's not in the original statute i don't
think

04:42:14.868 --> 04:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:42:17.190 --> 04:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
the original statute said parents or
 
04:42:17.200 --> 04:42:18.788 align:start position:0%
the original statute said parents or
guardians

04:42:18.788 --> 04:42:18.798 align:start position:0%
guardians
 
04:42:20.708 --> 04:42:20.718 align:start position:0%
now we have
 
04:42:22.070 --> 04:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
someone new to the district that just
 
04:42:23.670 --> 04:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
moved well we have residents in there
 
04:42:25.670 --> 04:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
now and i as a grandparent i'm not a
 
04:42:27.990 --> 04:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
legal guardian i'm not a parent i'm the
 
04:42:28.000 --> 04:42:29.510 align:start position:0%
legal guardian i'm not a parent i'm the
grandparent

04:42:29.510 --> 04:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
grandparent
 
04:42:31.750 --> 04:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
i'd like to access that materials also
 
04:42:33.830 --> 04:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
we have various schools that are
 
04:42:36.390 --> 04:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
supporting the school district within
 
04:42:38.948 --> 04:42:38.958 align:start position:0%
our district that would love to be able
 
04:42:41.190 --> 04:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
to dovetail and line what they're doing
 
04:42:42.628 --> 04:42:42.638 align:start position:0%
with the schools
 
04:42:44.310 --> 04:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
i i think there's going to be a lot of
 
04:42:45.750 --> 04:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
discretion here
 
04:42:48.390 --> 04:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
not discretion but responsibility placed
 
04:42:49.910 --> 04:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
on the administrators within the
 
04:42:51.190 --> 04:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
building the principles they're there
 
04:42:52.788 --> 04:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
for a purpose
 
04:42:52.798 --> 04:42:53.750 align:start position:0%
for a purpose
and

04:42:53.750 --> 04:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:42:55.190 --> 04:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think this says that you're
 
04:42:56.628 --> 04:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
going to want anybody's going to walk
 
04:42:59.670 --> 04:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
into a classroom i wouldn't allow it
 
04:43:01.670 --> 04:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
this is just a request of the school
 
04:43:03.670 --> 04:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
district to provide the curriculum
 
04:43:05.750 --> 04:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
materials they can be provided and it
 
04:43:07.430 --> 04:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't even have to be the teacher
 
04:43:09.830 --> 04:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's but i i in the situation where it
 
04:43:13.270 --> 04:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
is the parent or the uh legal guardian i
 
04:43:14.550 --> 04:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
think it'd be a wonderful opportunity
 
04:43:16.070 --> 04:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
for the teacher and those people to work
 
04:43:16.080 --> 04:43:17.670 align:start position:0%
for the teacher and those people to work
together

04:43:17.670 --> 04:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:43:20.550 --> 04:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um any further comments
 
04:43:22.550 --> 04:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative luno sure but i think
 
04:43:24.390 --> 04:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a very good good
 
04:43:27.830 --> 04:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
question as to why why i mean i
 
04:43:30.150 --> 04:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
i understand it in representative ladd's
 
04:43:33.670 --> 04:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
case that as as um as a parent or legal
 
04:43:36.310 --> 04:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
guardian or somebody who's who clearly
 
04:43:38.788 --> 04:43:38.798 align:start position:0%
has a responsibility for um
 
04:43:41.430 --> 04:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
for for for a child who's being educated
 
04:43:42.948 --> 04:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
in the public school district living in
 
04:43:45.190 --> 04:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
their home that they should be able to
 
04:43:46.390 --> 04:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
to go in
 
04:43:46.400 --> 04:43:47.990 align:start position:0%
to go in
and

04:43:47.990 --> 04:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:43:49.270 --> 04:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:43:49.280 --> 04:43:50.550 align:start position:0%
and and
request

04:43:50.550 --> 04:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
request
 
04:43:52.470 --> 04:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
to the extent practicable
 
04:43:54.550 --> 04:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
to review curriculum and course material
 
04:43:57.190 --> 04:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
but now i'm reading this as as any
 
04:43:59.750 --> 04:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
resident of the public school district
 
04:44:01.670 --> 04:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
which i think is representative porter's
 
04:44:04.310 --> 04:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
concern and and those
 
04:44:06.390 --> 04:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
residents of the public school district
 
04:44:08.310 --> 04:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
yes their tax dollars are paying for the
 
04:44:10.948 --> 04:44:10.958 align:start position:0%
public education there but their access
 
04:44:12.708 --> 04:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
to information is through their local
 
04:44:14.628 --> 04:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
school board through their local elected
 
04:44:16.788 --> 04:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
officials and not directly through the
 
04:44:19.270 --> 04:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh through the school district and so
 
04:44:22.310 --> 04:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm i'm wondering what this really
 
04:44:25.270 --> 04:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
does in terms of it's and it's not
 
04:44:28.628 --> 04:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
it's not exposing the school district to
 
04:44:31.190 --> 04:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
to something that they're trying to
 
04:44:31.200 --> 04:44:33.030 align:start position:0%
to something that they're trying to
um

04:44:33.030 --> 04:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:36.150 --> 04:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's it's it's just
 
04:44:39.110 --> 04:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
potentially putting uh putting a an
 
04:44:42.310 --> 04:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
unreasonable burden on
 
04:44:46.390 --> 04:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
on the um the the sau or the central
 
04:44:49.430 --> 04:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
office where where where you know
 
04:44:51.430 --> 04:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
residents i mean i certainly understand
 
04:44:53.350 --> 04:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
it parent legal guardian or somebody
 
04:44:56.470 --> 04:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's responsible for a child um
 
04:44:56.480 --> 04:44:57.350 align:start position:0%
that's that's responsible for a child um
student

04:44:57.350 --> 04:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:44:59.350 --> 04:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
would uh would would be interested to
 
04:45:01.830 --> 04:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
know what their what the materials are
 
04:45:04.708 --> 04:45:04.718 align:start position:0%
um but uh but for uh for uh for a
 
04:45:07.350 --> 04:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
resident you know your channel is
 
04:45:09.270 --> 04:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
through the is through the local elected
 
04:45:10.390 --> 04:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
school board
 
04:45:13.190 --> 04:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
and um and so i'm not i'm
 
04:45:15.030 --> 04:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
is there a better term
 
04:45:17.110 --> 04:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
here mr chair the
 
04:45:19.350 --> 04:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
representative ladd that would
 
04:45:20.550 --> 04:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
that would
 
04:45:20.560 --> 04:45:22.150 align:start position:0%
that would
um

04:45:22.150 --> 04:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:25.350 --> 04:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
i guess support what you were saying you
 
04:45:27.510 --> 04:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
know that that all right i'm taking care
 
04:45:29.990 --> 04:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
of a student in my household and i'm not
 
04:45:31.990 --> 04:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
a parent or a legal guardian but i
 
04:45:34.868 --> 04:45:34.878 align:start position:0%
definitely want to have access to these
 
04:45:34.878 --> 04:45:36.470 align:start position:0%
definitely want to have access to these
materials

04:45:36.470 --> 04:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
materials
 
04:45:37.990 --> 04:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
we have a school board which is the
 
04:45:39.590 --> 04:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
governing body they're the governance of
 
04:45:41.990 --> 04:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
the school district the administration
 
04:45:44.230 --> 04:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
superintendent principal supervisors
 
04:45:45.830 --> 04:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
curriculum directors are there to
 
04:45:45.840 --> 04:45:47.110 align:start position:0%
curriculum directors are there to
administer

04:45:47.110 --> 04:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
administer
 
04:45:50.868 --> 04:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
the the instruction the curriculum
 
04:45:54.310 --> 04:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
and when we're saying that a person that
 
04:45:56.150 --> 04:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
lives in that community cannot have
 
04:45:58.708 --> 04:45:58.718 align:start position:0%
access to information about that school
 
04:46:00.708 --> 04:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
you must go to school board
 
04:46:03.350 --> 04:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
i think we're really starting to
 
04:46:03.360 --> 04:46:04.948 align:start position:0%
i think we're really starting to
um

04:46:04.948 --> 04:46:04.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:08.470 --> 04:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
draw sides uh in education here and i i
 
04:46:10.948 --> 04:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
think we're going down a wrong path here
 
04:46:12.868 --> 04:46:12.878 align:start position:0%
i think it's time that we work together
 
04:46:15.510 --> 04:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
cooperatively the taxpayer in that town
 
04:46:18.070 --> 04:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
is paying for all those materials in
 
04:46:20.550 --> 04:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
those classrooms and i think they have
 
04:46:22.150 --> 04:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
the right to know
 
04:46:25.830 --> 04:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
what's being taught uh in schools uh and
 
04:46:30.310 --> 04:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
and materials being used uh it's
 
04:46:32.830 --> 04:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
it's you know to me that's just
 
04:46:35.510 --> 04:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh common
 
04:46:38.390 --> 04:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
working for the common good of children
 
04:46:40.310 --> 04:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
and and that's the bottom reason why
 
04:46:42.470 --> 04:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
we're all here is for the child and if
 
04:46:45.430 --> 04:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to not allow a resident
 
04:46:47.910 --> 04:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
district which is looking trying to
 
04:46:49.670 --> 04:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
become more knowledgeable and
 
04:46:51.990 --> 04:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
understanding the schools and possibly
 
04:46:54.150 --> 04:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
even trying to help the schools
 
04:46:56.070 --> 04:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
um why are you going to say well you've
 
04:46:57.670 --> 04:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
got to go jump through all these hoops
 
04:46:59.830 --> 04:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
to get access to that that just is going
 
04:47:01.990 --> 04:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
to scare parents away and put up a
 
04:47:04.150 --> 04:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
barrier and say look they're trying to
 
04:47:07.670 --> 04:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:09.270 --> 04:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
no i'm talking about the residents of
 
04:47:12.550 --> 04:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:14.470 --> 04:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
i think it's time to
 
04:47:20.628 --> 04:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:23.110 --> 04:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh one comment does it bother you that
 
04:47:26.470 --> 04:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
there is now groups that have bounties
 
04:47:28.788 --> 04:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
out there uh payments
 
04:47:30.868 --> 04:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
for uh finding
 
04:47:33.030 --> 04:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh different things that are presented
 
04:47:34.788 --> 04:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
in curriculum materials that they might
 
04:47:34.798 --> 04:47:36.070 align:start position:0%
in curriculum materials that they might
consider

04:47:36.070 --> 04:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
consider
 
04:47:38.948 --> 04:47:38.958 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that that bears on uh this
 
04:47:40.788 --> 04:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
amendment that we're discussing
 
04:47:43.270 --> 04:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
any further representative porter
 
04:47:45.030 --> 04:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry but i think it does bear do
 
04:47:46.708 --> 04:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
you know that there are more than 35
 
04:47:49.270 --> 04:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
teachers who have been
 
04:47:52.070 --> 04:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
turned in for investigation this in this
 
04:47:53.670 --> 04:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
last few months
 
04:47:57.430 --> 04:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
35 teachers have been questioned
 
04:47:57.440 --> 04:47:58.708 align:start position:0%
35 teachers have been questioned
already

04:47:58.708 --> 04:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:48:00.628 --> 04:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
the environment that we are in right now
 
04:48:02.948 --> 04:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
is very different than the environment
 
04:48:05.990 --> 04:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
we were used to when we were growing up
 
04:48:08.628 --> 04:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
in the communities in the schools
 
04:48:11.350 --> 04:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
it's scary out there
 
04:48:12.948 --> 04:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
people are scared i'm sorry
 
04:48:14.390 --> 04:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative you don't like that i'm
 
04:48:16.788 --> 04:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
saying this but people are scared
 
04:48:19.270 --> 04:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
they're afraid of people other people
 
04:48:21.750 --> 04:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
even their friends they don't know
 
04:48:23.270 --> 04:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
and people are
 
04:48:26.390 --> 04:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
can come and say and do things
 
04:48:28.628 --> 04:48:28.638 align:start position:0%
that are frightening
 
04:48:31.030 --> 04:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
there is going it's a scary time for
 
04:48:34.550 --> 04:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
schools you heard what mr christina said
 
04:48:36.470 --> 04:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
about the exhaustion and the stress that
 
04:48:38.230 --> 04:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
schools have been under that teachers
 
04:48:40.390 --> 04:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
have been under that staff and faculty
 
04:48:43.270 --> 04:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
and administrations have been under and
 
04:48:45.510 --> 04:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
always making it sound like the school
 
04:48:46.948 --> 04:48:46.958 align:start position:0%
is the enemy
 
04:48:50.230 --> 04:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
and that the public has a right
 
04:48:51.910 --> 04:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
against the schools which is how this
 
04:48:54.230 --> 04:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
comes out we want to know what's going
 
04:48:55.910 --> 04:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
on in these schools because we don't
 
04:48:57.270 --> 04:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
trust them
 
04:48:59.350 --> 04:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
well and that's what's coming out to the
 
04:48:59.360 --> 04:49:00.390 align:start position:0%
well and that's what's coming out to the
schools

04:49:00.390 --> 04:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
schools
 
04:49:03.350 --> 04:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
and when we put this kind of language in
 
04:49:05.590 --> 04:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
i'm afraid of hostile actors what
 
04:49:07.430 --> 04:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
happened to the school board member in
 
04:49:07.440 --> 04:49:09.030 align:start position:0%
happened to the school board member in
derry

04:49:09.030 --> 04:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
derry
 
04:49:11.190 --> 04:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
you read that article this is scary
 
04:49:13.990 --> 04:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
stuff and instead of soothing it it's
 
04:49:16.150 --> 04:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
making it worse when we do these that's
 
04:49:17.910 --> 04:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
what i'm concerned about all of the
 
04:49:19.750 --> 04:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
curriculum material is available to
 
04:49:21.990 --> 04:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
parents already just community members
 
04:49:24.628 --> 04:49:24.638 align:start position:0%
it's all online in most school districts
 
04:49:24.638 --> 04:49:25.430 align:start position:0%
it's all online in most school districts
and

04:49:25.430 --> 04:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:49:27.430 --> 04:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
saying that it's not
 
04:49:27.440 --> 04:49:28.310 align:start position:0%

it just i'm sorry i'm really
 
04:49:35.350 --> 04:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
concerned about this as you can tell
 
04:49:37.030 --> 04:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
if if the curriculum materials are
 
04:49:38.550 --> 04:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
already available then there should be
 
04:49:40.390 --> 04:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
no problem with passing this
 
04:49:42.230 --> 04:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
so are there any further comments yeah
 
04:49:44.390 --> 04:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say in here that you have to
 
04:49:46.070 --> 04:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
do it first and first you can put this
 
04:49:47.910 --> 04:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
stuff online just as well just like you
 
04:49:50.390 --> 04:49:50.400 align:start position:0%

we have some very difficult
 
05:08:23.750 --> 05:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:26.070 --> 05:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
when we all walk out of reps hall and
 
05:08:28.788 --> 05:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
you know i've done it now for 14 years
 
05:08:31.030 --> 05:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
and there's sometimes there's not
 
05:08:33.190 --> 05:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes we've often had you know
 
05:08:35.430 --> 05:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
issues which we've not seen things eye
 
05:08:36.708 --> 05:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
to eye
 
05:08:39.190 --> 05:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
but the next day i'm out good friends
 
05:08:41.510 --> 05:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
with folks and we're we're having fun
 
05:08:44.230 --> 05:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
together so it's just this is all what
 
05:08:45.510 --> 05:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
our country is all about it's a
 
05:08:48.550 --> 05:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
democratic uh society and
 
05:08:50.868 --> 05:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
let's just keep that in mind because i
 
05:08:52.390 --> 05:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
don't think anything's done
 
05:08:55.830 --> 05:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
anything's done here you know
 
05:08:58.868 --> 05:08:58.878 align:start position:0%
to to hurt or anything such that let's
 
05:09:00.150 --> 05:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
let's just
 
05:09:00.160 --> 05:09:01.030 align:start position:0%
let's just
stay

05:09:01.030 --> 05:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
stay
 
05:09:04.310 --> 05:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
up on the high road be magnanimous
 
05:09:04.320 --> 05:09:05.190 align:start position:0%
up on the high road be magnanimous
and

05:09:05.190 --> 05:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:09:06.628 --> 05:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
know that
 
05:09:08.868 --> 05:09:08.878 align:start position:0%
this is all about kids
 
05:09:12.310 --> 05:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
rick i i i would echo what you what you
 
05:09:15.670 --> 05:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
say now but i think politics has changed
 
05:09:17.590 --> 05:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
in the last few years and i and i think
 
05:09:19.990 --> 05:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the things that that
 
05:09:21.670 --> 05:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
has always worked out well in new
 
05:09:23.750 --> 05:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire is that we work together to
 
05:09:26.230 --> 05:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
compromise on things and the the number
 
05:09:29.350 --> 05:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
of bills going 10-9 not only in this
 
05:09:31.830 --> 05:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
committee but in committees throughout
 
05:09:33.590 --> 05:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire house
 
05:09:36.550 --> 05:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
i i think is it really really speaks to
 
05:09:40.470 --> 05:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
the to the sickness that we have in new
 
05:09:43.110 --> 05:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire politics and and i hope we can
 
05:09:44.150 --> 05:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
get back
 
05:09:46.868 --> 05:09:46.878 align:start position:0%
to to a time where where we've worked
 
05:09:49.510 --> 05:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
things out and um
 
05:09:51.190 --> 05:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
and you know it seems like out of this
 
05:09:53.510 --> 05:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
committee uh we're either all in
 
05:09:53.520 --> 05:09:54.390 align:start position:0%
committee uh we're either all in
agreement

05:09:54.390 --> 05:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
05:09:56.550 --> 05:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
on something that's really simple to do
 
05:09:58.628 --> 05:09:58.638 align:start position:0%
or we're going down party lines what i
 
05:10:01.990 --> 05:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
think we're about to do here on 1671
 
05:10:02.000 --> 05:10:02.788 align:start position:0%
think we're about to do here on 1671
um

05:10:02.788 --> 05:10:02.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:02.798 --> 05:10:04.070 align:start position:0%
um
uh

05:10:04.070 --> 05:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:10:06.390 --> 05:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
obviously it's been a very
 
05:10:09.270 --> 05:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
tricky road with 1671 certainly given
 
05:10:11.670 --> 05:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
where it started but but there has been
 
05:10:14.708 --> 05:10:14.718 align:start position:0%
collaboration on um on on getting to
 
05:10:17.670 --> 05:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
this one and hopefully we can see more
 
05:10:21.030 --> 05:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh work like this rather than rather
 
05:10:23.590 --> 05:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
than extreme party line stuff that that
 
05:10:25.270 --> 05:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
you know is not going to have the
 
05:10:28.150 --> 05:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
durability that i think granite staters
 
05:10:31.190 --> 05:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
expect in the in the laws that we pass i
 
05:10:33.510 --> 05:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
would concur with you uh but i think we
 
05:10:34.868 --> 05:10:34.878 align:start position:0%
need to highlight
 
05:10:34.878 --> 05:10:35.750 align:start position:0%
need to highlight
those

05:10:35.750 --> 05:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:10:37.510 --> 05:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
really important issues which we're
 
05:10:39.430 --> 05:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with here we've dealt with
 
05:10:41.350 --> 05:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
career technical education and know how
 
05:10:43.830 --> 05:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
we came out on that bill uh
 
05:10:45.750 --> 05:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
recognizing how we're going to align and
 
05:10:47.590 --> 05:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
get scheduling for the kids between the
 
05:10:49.990 --> 05:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
centers and the ascending schools uh
 
05:10:52.150 --> 05:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
look at what we've done in terms of the
 
05:10:55.670 --> 05:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
universities in terms of trying to
 
05:10:57.270 --> 05:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
even with that subcommittee we had when
 
05:10:59.270 --> 05:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
the governor was proposing merger and
 
05:11:01.830 --> 05:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
how he worked there and represented
 
05:11:03.830 --> 05:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
mullins how we worked on that committee
 
05:11:06.230 --> 05:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
dealing with special education and
 
05:11:08.708 --> 05:11:08.718 align:start position:0%
and and trying to
 
05:11:10.150 --> 05:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
just weave through sometimes we're
 
05:11:11.990 --> 05:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
weaving through minefields
 
05:11:15.190 --> 05:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
and and um it's not easy but there are
 
05:11:17.590 --> 05:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
some topics which are you know
 
05:11:19.750 --> 05:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
near and dear to us all
 
05:11:22.070 --> 05:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
that we do are successful at but there's
 
05:11:23.990 --> 05:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
others which we're getting that national
 
05:11:26.150 --> 05:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
agenda pouring down on us
 
05:11:29.750 --> 05:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
and i i agree it's been very difficult
 
05:11:31.350 --> 05:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's always been a little bit
 
05:11:33.750 --> 05:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
above that then let's try to get back if
 
05:11:36.150 --> 05:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
we're not there let's get back to it
 
05:11:38.310 --> 05:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
and and let's move ahead so we do have
 
05:11:41.110 --> 05:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
1671 in front of us right now
 
05:11:43.750 --> 05:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
that was just passed out we have
 
05:11:45.270 --> 05:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many bills left it must
 
05:11:52.868 --> 05:11:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:58.550 --> 05:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:59.830 --> 05:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
yeah why don't you take the gavel on
 
05:12:01.350 --> 05:12:01.360 align:start position:0%

relative to the content of an adequate
education

05:12:11.910 --> 05:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:12:13.190 --> 05:12:13.200 align:start position:0%

second by uh representative nelson again
 
05:12:54.550 --> 05:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
sure and
 
05:12:57.430 --> 05:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
comment uh further uh on the amendment
 
05:12:59.350 --> 05:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh chairman i'd like to go ahead and
 
05:13:03.030 --> 05:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
discuss uh the like the intent where why
 
05:13:04.390 --> 05:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:13:06.550 --> 05:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh as it is right now
 
05:13:09.990 --> 05:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
um as it was introduced it was a bill
 
05:13:12.948 --> 05:13:12.958 align:start position:0%
which was kind of a a hold over in many
 
05:13:15.270 --> 05:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
parts and even had been developed
 
05:13:18.070 --> 05:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
further than hb 242.
 
05:13:20.230 --> 05:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
it tried to accomplish a lot very
 
05:13:20.240 --> 05:13:21.510 align:start position:0%
it tried to accomplish a lot very
quickly

05:13:21.510 --> 05:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
05:13:21.520 --> 05:13:23.030 align:start position:0%
quickly
and

05:13:23.030 --> 05:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:13:25.190 --> 05:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
there was some phraseology in it which i
 
05:13:27.110 --> 05:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
will agree where
 
05:13:29.270 --> 05:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
we had core
 
05:13:32.070 --> 05:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
subjects or areas of learning and then
 
05:13:34.230 --> 05:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
we had other areas which went above and
 
05:13:35.590 --> 05:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
beyond that
 
05:13:37.990 --> 05:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
at the bottom part of the sheet and
 
05:13:40.470 --> 05:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
there is confusion is this now stating
 
05:13:42.470 --> 05:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
that those are all the responsibility of
 
05:13:45.270 --> 05:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
the local and not that of the state as
 
05:13:47.750 --> 05:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
far as adequacy the content that's
 
05:13:50.390 --> 05:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
required and of course then the all the
 
05:13:52.788 --> 05:13:52.798 align:start position:0%
fray occurred dealing with
 
05:13:54.550 --> 05:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
okay are we trying to unload some of the
 
05:13:57.270 --> 05:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
financial burden to
 
05:13:59.350 --> 05:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh local school districts
 
05:14:03.110 --> 05:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
that is the responsibility of the of the
 
05:14:05.910 --> 05:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
of the state and now as we look at the
 
05:14:08.230 --> 05:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
legislature our judicial decisions that
 
05:14:09.670 --> 05:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
came out of the claremont decision in
 
05:14:11.830 --> 05:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
the latter part of the 90s
 
05:14:13.750 --> 05:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
it was declared in those in those
 
05:14:16.230 --> 05:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
readings that
 
05:14:19.110 --> 05:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the state to
 
05:14:21.190 --> 05:14:21.200 align:start position:0%
deliver the opportunity for an adequate
 
05:14:24.390 --> 05:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
education goes well beyond just reading
 
05:14:26.708 --> 05:14:26.718 align:start position:0%
writing and arithmetic
 
05:14:28.708 --> 05:14:28.718 align:start position:0%
it had to do with all those subjects and
 
05:14:30.070 --> 05:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
i could read that
 
05:14:30.080 --> 05:14:30.948 align:start position:0%
i could read that
that

05:14:30.948 --> 05:14:30.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:14:32.230 --> 05:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
decision right here i have it in front
 
05:14:35.190 --> 05:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
of me but the point is that it is more
 
05:14:37.430 --> 05:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
than just that the knowledge and skills
 
05:14:39.670 --> 05:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
that we need for working and living
 
05:14:42.470 --> 05:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
together in this society so what this
 
05:14:44.390 --> 05:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
this new amendment does
 
05:14:47.190 --> 05:14:47.200 align:start position:0%
it takes the exact same language that we
 
05:14:50.708 --> 05:14:50.718 align:start position:0%
had on lines five through seven on the
 
05:14:54.070 --> 05:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
first page there that's right out of the
 
05:14:57.270 --> 05:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
statutes right now with the exception
 
05:15:00.830 --> 05:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
of line five that says and for each year
 
05:15:04.070 --> 05:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
thereafter so this started back in 2008
 
05:15:04.080 --> 05:15:06.310 align:start position:0%
thereafter so this started back in 2008
2009

05:15:06.310 --> 05:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
2009
 
05:15:06.320 --> 05:15:07.190 align:start position:0%
2009
and

05:15:07.190 --> 05:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:15:08.868 --> 05:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
went on the specific criterion
 
05:15:11.030 --> 05:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
substantive educational program blah
 
05:15:12.470 --> 05:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
blah blah
 
05:15:15.990 --> 05:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
so now it's it's each year thereafter
 
05:15:18.070 --> 05:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
and it spells out down below in these
 
05:15:20.788 --> 05:15:20.798 align:start position:0%
learning areas now there's been a lot of
 
05:15:23.350 --> 05:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
questions are how do we define
 
05:15:25.510 --> 05:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
what is learning areas
 
05:15:27.510 --> 05:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
when i met with attorneys today early
 
05:15:29.750 --> 05:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
this morning at eight o'clock
 
05:15:31.270 --> 05:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
the attorney said to me you could call
 
05:15:32.948 --> 05:15:32.958 align:start position:0%
this anything you could call spaghetti
 
05:15:34.310 --> 05:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
you're the legislature you have the
 
05:15:36.390 --> 05:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility you can do that
 
05:15:39.830 --> 05:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
and and but it what we are looking at is
 
05:15:41.670 --> 05:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
we're looking at basically that
 
05:15:43.750 --> 05:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
curriculum area or that subjects but
 
05:15:45.990 --> 05:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's basically better called learning
 
05:15:46.000 --> 05:15:47.270 align:start position:0%
it's basically better called learning
areas

05:15:47.270 --> 05:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
areas
 
05:15:49.270 --> 05:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
and i'll tell you that why as we whittle
 
05:15:51.030 --> 05:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
down through this
 
05:15:53.270 --> 05:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
the learning areas number one that you
 
05:15:54.628 --> 05:15:54.638 align:start position:0%
have in this bill
 
05:15:56.470 --> 05:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
are english language arts and reading
 
05:15:57.830 --> 05:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
that's in law
 
05:15:59.270 --> 05:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
everything down that points in law
 
05:16:02.150 --> 05:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
mathematics that's in law science is in
 
05:16:05.590 --> 05:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
law and science has left science because
 
05:16:07.270 --> 05:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
then you can split that up into the
 
05:16:09.110 --> 05:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
biological sciences the chemical
 
05:16:10.628 --> 05:16:10.638 align:start position:0%
sciences and natural sciences the
 
05:16:13.590 --> 05:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
physical sciences and on you go
 
05:16:16.628 --> 05:16:16.638 align:start position:0%
that may be better done through the bill
 
05:16:18.230 --> 05:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
we dealt with the other day when we talk
 
05:16:19.990 --> 05:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
about studies
 
05:16:22.470 --> 05:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
because within these
 
05:16:24.230 --> 05:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to call subject areas but
 
05:16:27.590 --> 05:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
in these learning areas you have various
 
05:16:30.628 --> 05:16:30.638 align:start position:0%
studies which support that for example
 
05:16:32.868 --> 05:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
we know that there's a number of topics
 
05:16:34.868 --> 05:16:34.878 align:start position:0%
within physical education which we have
 
05:16:37.190 --> 05:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
put into studies
 
05:16:38.868 --> 05:16:38.878 align:start position:0%
and there's a number of areas which we
 
05:16:41.030 --> 05:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
put into that same section law dealing
 
05:16:42.628 --> 05:16:42.638 align:start position:0%
with nutrition
 
05:16:45.670 --> 05:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
and history and instruction and all that
 
05:16:48.310 --> 05:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
so going down to the social studies and
 
05:16:50.150 --> 05:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
we've had discussion on it including
 
05:16:52.230 --> 05:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
government economics geography history
 
05:16:54.390 --> 05:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
in the holocaust and genocide
 
05:16:54.400 --> 05:16:56.150 align:start position:0%
in the holocaust and genocide
education

05:16:56.150 --> 05:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:16:59.430 --> 05:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
that's also in 193
 
05:16:59.440 --> 05:17:00.868 align:start position:0%
that's also in 193
e

05:17:00.868 --> 05:17:00.878 align:start position:0%
e
 
05:17:00.878 --> 05:17:02.150 align:start position:0%
e
2

05:17:02.150 --> 05:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
2
 
05:17:04.470 --> 05:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
that's pre in a section of law preceding
 
05:17:07.750 --> 05:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
this i was also told today that what you
 
05:17:11.190 --> 05:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
a person could make a real good case for
 
05:17:12.948 --> 05:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
those materials which are underneath
 
05:17:14.708 --> 05:17:14.718 align:start position:0%
knowledge and skills that precede this
 
05:17:17.910 --> 05:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
section of law are part of adequacy
 
05:17:20.070 --> 05:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
this is all in that adequacy chapter of
 
05:17:20.080 --> 05:17:21.990 align:start position:0%
this is all in that adequacy chapter of
law

05:17:21.990 --> 05:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:17:25.670 --> 05:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
so going on down arts education
 
05:17:27.750 --> 05:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
it says arts education and current law
 
05:17:29.430 --> 05:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
what we've done is after representative
 
05:17:31.270 --> 05:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
hall mentioned this the other day then i
 
05:17:33.350 --> 05:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
went and started saying
 
05:17:35.350 --> 05:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
yes that's i'm familiar with that and
 
05:17:37.590 --> 05:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
that's what i've seen elsewhere
 
05:17:40.788 --> 05:17:40.798 align:start position:0%
and so i picked up our our our rules
 
05:17:42.150 --> 05:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
here and
 
05:17:44.150 --> 05:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
and we gotta be careful we never develop
 
05:17:47.110 --> 05:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
our statutes based on rules statutes are
 
05:17:50.070 --> 05:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
rules are based on statute not statute
 
05:17:51.350 --> 05:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
on rules
 
05:17:53.270 --> 05:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
and we used to have at one point in time
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
after every one of these subjects the
 
05:17:58.788 --> 05:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
reference to that section of ed 306 that
 
05:18:01.830 --> 05:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
was all taken out simply because ed 306
 
05:18:04.390 --> 05:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
can change any time but by the by the
 
05:18:06.150 --> 05:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
state board they can't change our
 
05:18:06.160 --> 05:18:07.350 align:start position:0%
state board they can't change our
statute

05:18:07.350 --> 05:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:18:09.590 --> 05:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's law that we have to do
 
05:18:11.750 --> 05:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
and so under arts education it now
 
05:18:15.110 --> 05:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
reflects what was in in uh
 
05:18:17.670 --> 05:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
in in is in 306 and i'm going to read it
 
05:18:18.470 --> 05:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
to you
 
05:18:21.350 --> 05:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
it says arch arts education be provided
 
05:18:25.110 --> 05:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
for each k through 12 student in music
 
05:18:28.310 --> 05:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
and visual arts while developing
 
05:18:30.150 --> 05:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
supplemental but not required
 
05:18:32.948 --> 05:18:32.958 align:start position:0%
opportunities in dance media arts and
 
05:18:32.958 --> 05:18:34.310 align:start position:0%
opportunities in dance media arts and
theater

05:18:34.310 --> 05:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
theater
 
05:18:35.590 --> 05:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
so you can see there's three
 
05:18:37.910 --> 05:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
supplemental areas but the required
 
05:18:37.920 --> 05:18:38.948 align:start position:0%
supplemental areas but the required
areas

05:18:38.948 --> 05:18:38.958 align:start position:0%
areas
 
05:18:41.990 --> 05:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
are the music and the visual arts that's
 
05:18:45.750 --> 05:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
now in our law if we pass this and that
 
05:18:48.070 --> 05:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
will so state to when we are looking
 
05:18:50.708 --> 05:18:50.718 align:start position:0%
down the road at funding this this is
 
05:18:52.788 --> 05:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
there this is part of an adequate
 
05:18:55.990 --> 05:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
education this is part of that content
 
05:18:57.990 --> 05:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
going on down to world languages that's
 
05:18:59.430 --> 05:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere what we had health and
 
05:19:01.750 --> 05:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
wellness health and wellness wellness
 
05:19:03.270 --> 05:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
has never been there but health and well
 
05:19:07.270 --> 05:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
wellness is all through 306 and we've
 
05:19:09.430 --> 05:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
just done that in the area of studies as
 
05:19:09.440 --> 05:19:11.430 align:start position:0%
just done that in the area of studies as
well

05:19:11.430 --> 05:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:19:11.440 --> 05:19:12.708 align:start position:0%
well
um

05:19:12.708 --> 05:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:15.830 --> 05:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
what we in years to come we need to
 
05:19:18.948 --> 05:19:18.958 align:start position:0%
address this one area here including a
 
05:19:22.390 --> 05:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
policy for violations of rsa 126 k colon
 
05:19:22.400 --> 05:19:23.190 align:start position:0%
policy for violations of rsa 126 k colon
8

05:19:23.190 --> 05:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
8
 
05:19:25.350 --> 05:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
roman 1 8.
 
05:19:27.910 --> 05:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
that's an area that needs to be put in
 
05:19:29.990 --> 05:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
the law it's in law right now right
 
05:19:30.000 --> 05:19:30.948 align:start position:0%
the law it's in law right now right
there

05:19:30.948 --> 05:19:30.958 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:19:32.788 --> 05:19:32.798 align:start position:0%
but somewhere along the way it needs to
 
05:19:35.190 --> 05:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
be taken out of this section of adequacy
 
05:19:37.190 --> 05:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
and put elsewhere in statute it's it's
 
05:19:39.350 --> 05:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
been placed incorrectly and that's
 
05:19:41.270 --> 05:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
something we've i've been told over and
 
05:19:43.510 --> 05:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
over by legislative services but that's
 
05:19:44.708 --> 05:19:44.718 align:start position:0%
another day
 
05:19:46.550 --> 05:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's nothing critical at this point in
 
05:19:49.030 --> 05:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
time physical education
 
05:19:50.948 --> 05:19:50.958 align:start position:0%
engineering and technologies including
 
05:19:53.350 --> 05:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
technology applications the including
 
05:19:55.990 --> 05:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
technology applications is new to this
 
05:19:58.628 --> 05:19:58.638 align:start position:0%
bill new but it's also
 
05:20:00.868 --> 05:20:00.878 align:start position:0%
a very vital part in in dealing with
 
05:20:02.868 --> 05:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
engineering and technology
 
05:20:05.270 --> 05:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
learning areas it's how you apply it and
 
05:20:06.390 --> 05:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
use it
 
05:20:09.270 --> 05:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
personal finance literacy that is a new
 
05:20:10.708 --> 05:20:10.718 align:start position:0%
area and of course you know that that's
 
05:20:12.470 --> 05:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
a result of the
 
05:20:14.788 --> 05:20:14.798 align:start position:0%
the absolute support we've had come in
 
05:20:16.230 --> 05:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire bankers
 
05:20:18.390 --> 05:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
association the chamber of commerce
 
05:20:20.948 --> 05:20:20.958 align:start position:0%
business industry association
 
05:20:22.788 --> 05:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
and we've had it come into through our
 
05:20:24.548 --> 05:20:24.558 align:start position:0%
legislature in many years we've heard
 
05:20:26.868 --> 05:20:26.878 align:start position:0%
people introduce bills on this
 
05:20:29.990 --> 05:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
and it's also reflected in 306 right now
 
05:20:32.708 --> 05:20:32.718 align:start position:0%
within economics at the high school it
 
05:20:34.310 --> 05:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
also includes
 
05:20:36.628 --> 05:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
personal finance there however that's
 
05:20:38.070 --> 05:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
not the only place we should be teaching
 
05:20:39.510 --> 05:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
this you don't wait until you take that
 
05:20:41.510 --> 05:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
course in high school to teach a family
 
05:20:43.270 --> 05:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
about family budget or a child that you
 
05:20:45.110 --> 05:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
can't go into school in store and just
 
05:20:48.150 --> 05:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
want this want that and and not equating
 
05:20:51.670 --> 05:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
it to need versus want
 
05:20:54.070 --> 05:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh then it goes on this uh area right
 
05:20:56.230 --> 05:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
here teachers shall use academic and
 
05:20:57.670 --> 05:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
applied instruction to teach the
 
05:21:00.070 --> 05:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
learning areas and notice that it's no
 
05:21:02.310 --> 05:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
longer core areas it's learning areas
 
05:21:03.830 --> 05:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
they're of course out of this thing
 
05:21:03.840 --> 05:21:05.190 align:start position:0%
they're of course out of this thing
totally

05:21:05.190 --> 05:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
totally
 
05:21:07.510 --> 05:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
under sub paragraph a above and and then
 
05:21:09.910 --> 05:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
we use and it used to be computer
 
05:21:11.830 --> 05:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
science we had some discussion on it's
 
05:21:15.670 --> 05:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
computer use it's a tool because the the
 
05:21:17.590 --> 05:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
if you go up to technology applications
 
05:21:20.390 --> 05:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
that's where you're where are
 
05:21:22.788 --> 05:21:22.798 align:start position:0%
taking in account the new technologies
 
05:21:24.788 --> 05:21:24.798 align:start position:0%
and it's just not all computers as well
 
05:21:26.470 --> 05:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
there's others if you walk in career
 
05:21:28.390 --> 05:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
technical education and you're going to
 
05:21:30.548 --> 05:21:30.558 align:start position:0%
see all kinds of technology
 
05:21:32.788 --> 05:21:32.798 align:start position:0%
and in the classrooms digital literacy
 
05:21:34.788 --> 05:21:34.798 align:start position:0%
is extremely important
 
05:21:36.310 --> 05:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
we need to integrate these type of
 
05:21:38.070 --> 05:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
things along with logic and rhetoric
 
05:21:40.548 --> 05:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
into the our instruction
 
05:21:43.590 --> 05:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
for all these learning areas 1 through
 
05:21:43.600 --> 05:21:44.948 align:start position:0%
for all these learning areas 1 through
10.

05:21:44.948 --> 05:21:44.958 align:start position:0%
10.
 
05:21:46.548 --> 05:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
going down below
 
05:21:46.558 --> 05:21:48.390 align:start position:0%
going down below
abc

05:21:48.390 --> 05:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
abc
 
05:21:50.628 --> 05:21:50.638 align:start position:0%
are already in law that's those are
 
05:21:53.030 --> 05:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
areas which deal with the net of the
 
05:21:53.040 --> 05:21:54.310 align:start position:0%
areas which deal with the net of the
standards

05:21:54.310 --> 05:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
standards
 
05:21:56.548 --> 05:21:56.558 align:start position:0%
and definition of curriculum i won't go
 
05:21:58.708 --> 05:21:58.718 align:start position:0%
into that that's in-law but these areas
 
05:22:01.110 --> 05:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
right here are areas that you've seen
 
05:22:04.230 --> 05:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
many times before that are in this and
 
05:22:05.590 --> 05:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
the last part
 
05:22:07.830 --> 05:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
is a part that deals with accountability
 
05:22:09.110 --> 05:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
for an opportunity for inadequate
 
05:22:11.750 --> 05:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
education and there's a lot of ways we
 
05:22:13.350 --> 05:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
look for a there's two ways with the
 
05:22:15.190 --> 05:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
inputs and the outputs there are the
 
05:22:17.830 --> 05:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
performance side with the assessment
 
05:22:19.830 --> 05:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
but the areas where we're looking into
 
05:22:21.510 --> 05:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
in our state standards here in the
 
05:22:21.520 --> 05:22:22.310 align:start position:0%
in our state standards here in the
school

05:22:22.310 --> 05:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:22:24.310 --> 05:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
approval standards are these
 
05:22:26.708 --> 05:22:26.718 align:start position:0%
10 areas that we had in the learning
 
05:22:28.868 --> 05:22:28.878 align:start position:0%
areas along with those two other areas
 
05:22:32.708 --> 05:22:32.718 align:start position:0%
which are in law currently regarding
 
05:22:32.718 --> 05:22:33.510 align:start position:0%
which are in law currently regarding
the

05:22:33.510 --> 05:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:22:36.150 --> 05:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
minimum credit uh school year
 
05:22:38.230 --> 05:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
requirements and minimum credits
 
05:22:41.270 --> 05:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
required for high school diploma
 
05:22:43.910 --> 05:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
the personal finance literacy
 
05:22:46.230 --> 05:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
by putting it here as we did before it
 
05:22:49.190 --> 05:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
also states that we give a year for
 
05:22:51.190 --> 05:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
school districts to figure out how they
 
05:22:53.270 --> 05:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
might want to embed it or integrate it
 
05:22:56.230 --> 05:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
into areas of instruction
 
05:22:58.548 --> 05:22:58.558 align:start position:0%
i would venture to say that many of our
 
05:23:00.310 --> 05:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
elementary intermediate middle schools
 
05:23:02.868 --> 05:23:02.878 align:start position:0%
are doing it right now and high schools
 
05:23:04.470 --> 05:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
as well
 
05:23:06.390 --> 05:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
we have certainly a lot of cooperation
 
05:23:09.990 --> 05:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
from um various organizations to put
 
05:23:12.390 --> 05:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
to do that so that's this bill that's
 
05:23:14.708 --> 05:23:14.718 align:start position:0%
totally them it this replaces everything
 
05:23:17.110 --> 05:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
else so we're not dealing with costing
 
05:23:19.030 --> 05:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
we're not dealing with delivery we're
 
05:23:21.350 --> 05:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
not dealing with some of the aspects the
 
05:23:22.948 --> 05:23:22.958 align:start position:0%
other bills have done
 
05:23:26.230 --> 05:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much mr chair uh
 
05:23:27.670 --> 05:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
representative nelson is the secretary
 
05:23:32.150 --> 05:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
do you have anything further no no
 
05:23:34.708 --> 05:23:34.718 align:start position:0%
any further comments from the committee
 
05:23:36.310 --> 05:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative luno sure thank you
 
05:23:40.548 --> 05:23:40.558 align:start position:0%
very much mr chair and um and my um um
 
05:23:42.868 --> 05:23:42.878 align:start position:0%
my assumption here uh representative
 
05:23:46.150 --> 05:23:46.160 align:start position:0%
ladd is that this sets the floor
 
05:23:47.670 --> 05:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
for um for
 
05:23:49.830 --> 05:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh delivering an opportunity for an
 
05:23:52.948 --> 05:23:52.958 align:start position:0%
adequate education and not the um and
 
05:23:56.150 --> 05:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
not the ceiling for what a uh for what a
 
05:23:57.590 --> 05:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
public school
 
05:23:59.510 --> 05:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
may teach so if a public school did want
 
05:24:02.230 --> 05:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
to teach computer science uh it could
 
05:24:04.548 --> 05:24:04.558 align:start position:0%
certainly do that or teach um things
 
05:24:07.350 --> 05:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
that are that are significantly extended
 
05:24:09.030 --> 05:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
off of this
 
05:24:10.788 --> 05:24:10.798 align:start position:0%
list isn't that correct that's
 
05:24:12.390 --> 05:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct you know the local
 
05:24:14.470 --> 05:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
school has responsibility for curriculum
 
05:24:17.590 --> 05:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
and instruction uh this right here we're
 
05:24:20.628 --> 05:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
identifying for the floor for our
 
05:24:22.548 --> 05:24:22.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education we
 
05:24:26.390 --> 05:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
are defining now those learning areas
 
05:24:27.830 --> 05:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
that are
 
05:24:29.510 --> 05:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
that are a must
 
05:24:31.670 --> 05:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
and that we have to then look at that in
 
05:24:34.070 --> 05:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
terms of when we're creating a funding
 
05:24:36.628 --> 05:24:36.638 align:start position:0%
formula we're taking account these are
 
05:24:37.590 --> 05:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
05:24:43.510 --> 05:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:45.750 --> 05:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
05:24:47.030 --> 05:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
i'd like to make another call i'd like
 
05:24:49.030 --> 05:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
to make a comment yes so so thank you
 
05:24:51.110 --> 05:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
very much mr chair um
 
05:24:53.750 --> 05:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
for uh um
 
05:24:55.990 --> 05:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
for a lot of the same reasons
 
05:25:00.948 --> 05:25:00.958 align:start position:0%
that um that i articulated yesterday i i
 
05:25:02.868 --> 05:25:02.878 align:start position:0%
i don't believe
 
05:25:04.548 --> 05:25:04.558 align:start position:0%
uh i am going to support the amendment i
 
05:25:06.628 --> 05:25:06.638 align:start position:0%
am going to support the bill as amended
 
05:25:08.708 --> 05:25:08.718 align:start position:0%
but for a lot of reasons i don't believe
 
05:25:11.590 --> 05:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
now is a great time for um
 
05:25:15.830 --> 05:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
for uh for the legislature to be um
 
05:25:31.110 --> 05:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:33.590 --> 05:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
the um representative ladd was in a
 
05:25:35.430 --> 05:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
conversation anyway so i'll start from
 
05:25:38.948 --> 05:25:38.958 align:start position:0%
well no i'll quickly so so
 
05:25:40.628 --> 05:25:40.638 align:start position:0%
very very quickly i am going to support
 
05:25:42.628 --> 05:25:42.638 align:start position:0%
the amendment i am going to support the
 
05:25:45.110 --> 05:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
the bill is amended um but for a lot of
 
05:25:47.510 --> 05:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
the same reasons i taught i i discussed
 
05:25:49.270 --> 05:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
yesterday i don't believe now is a
 
05:25:51.510 --> 05:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
really great time for um for the
 
05:25:54.548 --> 05:25:54.558 align:start position:0%
legislature to be monkeying around
 
05:25:55.750 --> 05:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
in um
 
05:25:58.230 --> 05:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
in this neck of the woods uh there is a
 
05:26:00.470 --> 05:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh obviously an ongoing lawsuit where
 
05:26:02.150 --> 05:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
the state is uh
 
05:26:05.110 --> 05:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
is a defendant and and this area is is
 
05:26:07.430 --> 05:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
material to that i do believe the
 
05:26:10.310 --> 05:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
amendment makes some make some very good
 
05:26:13.110 --> 05:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
improvements in the areas of in the area
 
05:26:17.590 --> 05:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
of of the um the approval standards um
 
05:26:19.590 --> 05:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
for learning areas for uh for inadequate
 
05:26:22.070 --> 05:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
education uh particularly the holocaust
 
05:26:25.190 --> 05:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
and genocide education consistent with
 
05:26:28.310 --> 05:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
with with what was enacted last year and
 
05:26:31.510 --> 05:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
um and improvements with in in personal
 
05:26:34.150 --> 05:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
finance literacy and some other um and
 
05:26:36.310 --> 05:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
some other areas that were done so so i
 
05:26:40.150 --> 05:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
think there's there's a lot here that um
 
05:26:43.510 --> 05:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
that that is important but but i i am
 
05:26:46.788 --> 05:26:46.798 align:start position:0%
concerned uh about the uh the timing and
 
05:26:49.430 --> 05:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
whether this is um is is really good to
 
05:26:52.310 --> 05:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
do at this point i hope the um
 
05:26:55.030 --> 05:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh the other chamber will uh we'll
 
05:26:57.510 --> 05:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
consider that as as as
 
05:26:59.990 --> 05:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of whether or not um
 
05:27:03.350 --> 05:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know it's timely to to to move uh
 
05:27:05.110 --> 05:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
this through but like i said i'm gonna
 
05:27:06.548 --> 05:27:06.558 align:start position:0%
support the amendment and the bill is
 
05:27:06.558 --> 05:27:08.310 align:start position:0%
support the amendment and the bill is
amended

05:27:08.310 --> 05:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
amended
 
05:27:10.628 --> 05:27:10.638 align:start position:0%
any further comment
 
05:27:11.990 --> 05:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
i have one comment i know you want to
 
05:27:14.070 --> 05:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
move but i think at a time when we're
 
05:27:15.750 --> 05:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with conval and some of those
 
05:27:17.430 --> 05:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
other issues going on
 
05:27:19.350 --> 05:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
it's a good time for the legislature to
 
05:27:22.548 --> 05:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
step forward and say that we are working
 
05:27:24.708 --> 05:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
in several zones to try to address the
 
05:27:27.110 --> 05:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education
 
05:27:27.120 --> 05:27:27.990 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education
and

05:27:27.990 --> 05:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:27:29.510 --> 05:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
and this shows that we're not sitting
 
05:27:32.310 --> 05:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
back on our on our heels and not we're
 
05:27:34.470 --> 05:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
recognizing that
 
05:27:36.230 --> 05:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
there are certain responsibilities we
 
05:27:38.628 --> 05:27:38.638 align:start position:0%
have and certain learning areas that we
 
05:27:41.190 --> 05:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility for and we're so
 
05:27:43.670 --> 05:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
saying right here now that and we've
 
05:27:45.510 --> 05:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
also said further by the interim study
 
05:27:47.270 --> 05:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
we're doing with uh on the other side of
 
05:27:49.270 --> 05:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
the coin with the dollar bill
 
05:27:49.280 --> 05:27:51.590 align:start position:0%
the coin with the dollar bill
funding

05:27:51.590 --> 05:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
funding
 
05:27:54.230 --> 05:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
right and and uh and thank you mr chair
 
05:27:54.240 --> 05:27:55.590 align:start position:0%
right and and uh and thank you mr chair
for

05:27:55.590 --> 05:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:27:57.990 --> 05:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
just i and and i agree with what
 
05:28:00.150 --> 05:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
representative ladd said there the
 
05:28:02.548 --> 05:28:02.558 align:start position:0%
conval case though however is about uh
 
05:28:04.070 --> 05:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not um
 
05:28:06.230 --> 05:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh new hampshire is is funding its
 
05:28:08.868 --> 05:28:08.878 align:start position:0%
school schools in a constitutional way
 
05:28:12.230 --> 05:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
and whether current funding um is uh is
 
05:28:15.110 --> 05:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
is sufficient to cover the cost of an
 
05:28:17.430 --> 05:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
adequate education and now we're
 
05:28:20.150 --> 05:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
changing the definition of an adequate
 
05:28:23.270 --> 05:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
education by putting a few more
 
05:28:26.310 --> 05:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
block a few more things in the box
 
05:28:29.350 --> 05:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
so so whether or not that will be looked
 
05:28:29.360 --> 05:28:30.310 align:start position:0%
so so whether or not that will be looked
on

05:28:30.310 --> 05:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:28:31.750 --> 05:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
who knows how that's going to be looked
 
05:28:33.110 --> 05:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
on by
 
05:28:36.470 --> 05:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
by the by the court but but i absolutely
 
05:28:38.708 --> 05:28:38.718 align:start position:0%
agree with with what representative ladd
 
05:28:41.430 --> 05:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
is saying that that um
 
05:28:44.868 --> 05:28:44.878 align:start position:0%
uh a bill like this but but and more
 
05:28:46.868 --> 05:28:46.878 align:start position:0%
significantly a bill like like the
 
05:28:49.190 --> 05:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity plan shows the
 
05:28:51.430 --> 05:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
court that the legislature is serious
 
05:28:54.310 --> 05:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
about its um about its responsibility
 
05:28:56.628 --> 05:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
and obligations to both define an
 
05:28:59.350 --> 05:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
adequate education and fund it so
 
05:28:59.360 --> 05:29:00.470 align:start position:0%
adequate education and fund it so
thanks

05:29:00.470 --> 05:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
05:29:04.150 --> 05:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
thank you see no further comments um
 
05:29:07.830 --> 05:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
we'll take a uh hand poll on the uh
 
05:29:07.840 --> 05:29:08.948 align:start position:0%
we'll take a uh hand poll on the uh
amendment

05:29:08.948 --> 05:29:08.958 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:29:11.670 --> 05:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh 1024
 
05:29:13.830 --> 05:29:13.840 align:start position:0%

specific
[Music]

05:58:27.990 --> 05:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:58:29.910 --> 05:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
amendment we'll have to open a
 
05:58:29.920 --> 05:58:31.110 align:start position:0%
amendment we'll have to open a
discussion

05:58:31.110 --> 05:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
05:58:32.390 --> 05:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
right now because there are two of them
 
05:58:35.190 --> 05:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
right there one from myself and one from
 
05:58:39.590 --> 05:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:41.430 --> 05:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
there there's
 
05:58:41.440 --> 05:58:42.230 align:start position:0%
there there's
two

05:58:42.230 --> 05:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:58:44.548 --> 05:58:44.558 align:start position:0%
differences but uh there well there's
 
05:58:46.470 --> 05:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
several differences
 
05:58:50.070 --> 05:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh one is this for uh conversion charter
 
05:58:51.590 --> 05:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
schools everybody familiar with what a
 
05:58:53.510 --> 05:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
conversion charter school is there's a
 
05:58:55.270 --> 05:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
number of ways two ways the charter
 
05:58:57.270 --> 05:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
school beca comes law
 
05:58:59.190 --> 05:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
and the conversion charter school is the
 
05:59:01.350 --> 05:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
one which is it's still underneath the
 
05:59:04.150 --> 05:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
district it's a decision of the local
 
05:59:06.788 --> 05:59:06.798 align:start position:0%
school district to go that direction
 
05:59:08.788 --> 05:59:08.798 align:start position:0%
and it remains money comes through the
 
05:59:10.708 --> 05:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
school district to that charter school
 
05:59:12.310 --> 05:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
whereas the funding for the other
 
05:59:14.470 --> 05:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
charter schools in our state comes from
 
05:59:17.030 --> 05:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
a different account
 
05:59:19.110 --> 05:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
and they're not beholding to the school
 
05:59:19.120 --> 05:59:21.270 align:start position:0%
and they're not beholding to the school
district

05:59:21.270 --> 05:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
district
 
05:59:24.230 --> 05:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
so this the one bill right here which is
 
05:59:27.830 --> 05:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
mine requires a three-fifths vote
 
05:59:29.990 --> 05:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
and it's both of my peers have
 
05:59:30.000 --> 05:59:31.350 align:start position:0%
and it's both of my peers have
eliminated

05:59:31.350 --> 05:59:31.360 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
05:59:31.360 --> 05:59:32.310 align:start position:0%
eliminated
the

05:59:32.310 --> 05:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:59:34.628 --> 05:59:34.638 align:start position:0%
the majority of its prospective teachers
 
05:59:36.868 --> 05:59:36.878 align:start position:0%
have to give a vote two-thirds in the in
 
05:59:38.070 --> 05:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
the written comments of the
 
05:59:39.750 --> 05:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent principal
 
05:59:43.750 --> 05:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh it looks like both bills
 
05:59:46.070 --> 05:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
change that and and represent luna can
 
05:59:47.750 --> 05:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
talk to us if there if there's more need
 
05:59:48.948 --> 05:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
to be said
 
05:59:51.270 --> 05:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
the his his bill
 
05:59:54.150 --> 05:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
requires a two-thirds majority vote of
 
05:59:54.160 --> 05:59:54.948 align:start position:0%
requires a two-thirds majority vote of
the

05:59:54.948 --> 05:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:59:58.868 --> 05:59:58.878 align:start position:0%
um school district at a rigger meeting
 
06:00:01.430 --> 06:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
mine request requires a three-fist
 
06:00:03.190 --> 06:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
that's a difference of what
 
06:00:06.390 --> 06:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
um six percent
 
06:00:08.230 --> 06:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
so it's not a heck of a lot of a lot of
 
06:00:08.240 --> 06:00:09.910 align:start position:0%
so it's not a heck of a lot of a lot of
difference

06:00:09.910 --> 06:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
difference
 
06:00:11.910 --> 06:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
and in the school district at a regular
 
06:00:14.708 --> 06:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
meeting or at a special meeting uh so
 
06:00:16.868 --> 06:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
mine has the two meetings
 
06:00:21.030 --> 06:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:23.590 --> 06:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
is it the same i
 
06:00:29.190 --> 06:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:30.948 --> 06:00:30.958 align:start position:0%
b is in current that's current law it's
 
06:00:32.948 --> 06:00:32.958 align:start position:0%
in current law so it's kind of a you
 
06:00:32.958 --> 06:00:33.910 align:start position:0%
in current law so it's kind of a you
know

06:00:33.910 --> 06:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:00:35.510 --> 06:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
more than what we really need in the
 
06:00:36.868 --> 06:00:36.878 align:start position:0%
bill that i had there it's just the way
 
06:00:39.590 --> 06:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
it shows you that the drafting snag the
 
06:00:41.750 --> 06:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
drafters oftentimes do this it's
 
06:00:44.548 --> 06:00:44.558 align:start position:0%
different for different people
 
06:00:44.558 --> 06:00:45.750 align:start position:0%
different for different people
so

06:00:45.750 --> 06:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:00:47.990 --> 06:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
i i i can live with either one of these
 
06:00:51.110 --> 06:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
i think that a school district that's uh
 
06:00:53.030 --> 06:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
wanting to go into the conversion
 
06:00:53.040 --> 06:00:54.070 align:start position:0%
wanting to go into the conversion
business

06:00:54.070 --> 06:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
business
 
06:00:54.080 --> 06:00:55.190 align:start position:0%
business
um

06:00:55.190 --> 06:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:57.190 --> 06:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
it should be done probably for sure i
 
06:00:59.830 --> 06:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
think at the annual meeting
 
06:01:01.590 --> 06:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
calling a special meeting you could get
 
06:01:03.430 --> 06:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
fewer people there and you could you
 
06:01:05.030 --> 06:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
could push this thing
 
06:01:07.270 --> 06:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
a little easier and i think if you're
 
06:01:09.510 --> 06:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
going to change and convert your school
 
06:01:11.670 --> 06:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
district or your high school or whatever
 
06:01:15.030 --> 06:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
level to a charter school this is a huge
 
06:01:15.040 --> 06:01:16.470 align:start position:0%
level to a charter school this is a huge
huge

06:01:16.470 --> 06:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
huge
 
06:01:16.480 --> 06:01:17.350 align:start position:0%
huge
deal

06:01:17.350 --> 06:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
deal
 
06:01:19.030 --> 06:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:01:20.708 --> 06:01:20.718 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't hold any punches or you
 
06:01:22.470 --> 06:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
know it should be done clearly that way
 
06:01:22.480 --> 06:01:23.590 align:start position:0%
know it should be done clearly that way
so

06:01:23.590 --> 06:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:01:26.230 --> 06:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
i i'm good with either direction here
 
06:01:27.590 --> 06:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
represent porter
 
06:01:29.350 --> 06:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i i want to
 
06:01:31.750 --> 06:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
congratulate you on that because yes you
 
06:01:33.990 --> 06:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
can anybody can call a special district
 
06:01:36.070 --> 06:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
a special meeting with just 50
 
06:01:37.750 --> 06:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
signatures and even though the school
 
06:01:40.470 --> 06:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
board has to approve it it is
 
06:01:42.708 --> 06:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
better i think to take it as a matter of
 
06:01:45.190 --> 06:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
course at a regular meeting
 
06:01:47.670 --> 06:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
with plenty of preparation ahead of time
 
06:01:49.868 --> 06:01:49.878 align:start position:0%
as would be done with those so i
 
06:01:52.230 --> 06:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
congratulate you on saying that and that
 
06:01:55.110 --> 06:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
would make me want to support
 
06:01:57.350 --> 06:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
the amendment that it takes out special
 
06:01:58.708 --> 06:01:58.718 align:start position:0%
means thank you very much representative
 
06:02:00.150 --> 06:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
porter i appreciate it
 
06:02:02.070 --> 06:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
i could call a special meeting in the
 
06:02:03.670 --> 06:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
middle of summer when everybody's off in
 
06:02:06.070 --> 06:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
istanbul or some when i'm not istanbul
 
06:02:10.390 --> 06:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh hopefully hopefully ogunquit um
 
06:02:13.670 --> 06:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
and uh so uh yeah and have few people
 
06:02:15.430 --> 06:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
there and control things but at the
 
06:02:17.030 --> 06:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
annual meeting which is done at the time
 
06:02:18.948 --> 06:02:18.958 align:start position:0%

cordelli uh any further discussion
 
06:04:20.868 --> 06:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
yes representative ellison uh i raised
 
06:04:23.110 --> 06:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
the question and i'm not sure who's who
 
06:04:25.270 --> 06:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
answers this when we had earlier
 
06:04:27.030 --> 06:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
discussions on a couple of occasions on
 
06:04:28.150 --> 06:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:04:30.390 --> 06:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
my question was about labor agreements
 
06:04:32.310 --> 06:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
that would be in place
 
06:04:34.310 --> 06:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh and for instance you could have a
 
06:04:36.628 --> 06:04:36.638 align:start position:0%
three-year contract between
 
06:04:38.548 --> 06:04:38.558 align:start position:0%
the teachers association and the school
 
06:04:41.430 --> 06:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
board and the charter conversion vote
 
06:04:43.110 --> 06:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
might take place
 
06:04:45.430 --> 06:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
06:04:47.990 --> 06:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
does that then change the nature of that
 
06:04:50.628 --> 06:04:50.638 align:start position:0%
labor agreement with the teachers who
 
06:04:52.628 --> 06:04:52.638 align:start position:0%
end up being in the charter conversion
 
06:04:52.638 --> 06:04:53.830 align:start position:0%
end up being in the charter conversion
school

06:04:53.830 --> 06:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
school
 
06:04:56.470 --> 06:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the regular school
 
06:04:59.270 --> 06:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
i thought we had that answered from
 
06:05:02.150 --> 06:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
mr green when he's here or dr green
 
06:05:03.510 --> 06:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
do you remember can you remember
 
06:05:06.230 --> 06:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock
 
06:05:08.628 --> 06:05:08.638 align:start position:0%
i do oh there you go
 
06:05:11.270 --> 06:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
oh do you want the answer yeah okay um
 
06:05:13.990 --> 06:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
what he said was that the the union can
 
06:05:14.000 --> 06:05:15.110 align:start position:0%
what he said was that the the union can
continue

06:05:15.110 --> 06:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
continue
 
06:05:16.470 --> 06:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
in the regular school
 
06:05:18.788 --> 06:05:18.798 align:start position:0%
but those folks the teachers are under
 
06:05:20.868 --> 06:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
union any union contract that goes into
 
06:05:23.430 --> 06:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
the conversion school they may unionize
 
06:05:29.350 --> 06:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:32.230 --> 06:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what he said i think yes
 
06:05:34.390 --> 06:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification uh
 
06:05:36.150 --> 06:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
based on that i'll be voting against the
 
06:05:39.910 --> 06:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
bill uh because it raises the issue that
 
06:05:42.230 --> 06:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
we have an existing labor contract which
 
06:05:44.868 --> 06:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
would be abrogated for some people by a
 
06:05:46.548 --> 06:05:46.558 align:start position:0%
charter conversion vote
 
06:05:46.558 --> 06:05:47.670 align:start position:0%
charter conversion vote
and

06:05:47.670 --> 06:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:05:49.190 --> 06:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
i'm going to stand with my brothers and
 
06:05:50.788 --> 06:05:50.798 align:start position:0%
sisters in the union movement on this
 
06:05:50.798 --> 06:05:52.390 align:start position:0%
sisters in the union movement on this
one

06:05:52.390 --> 06:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
one
 
06:05:53.750 --> 06:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:05:55.590 --> 06:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes represent
 
06:05:55.600 --> 06:05:56.948 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes represent
woodcock

06:05:56.948 --> 06:05:56.958 align:start position:0%
woodcock
 
06:05:59.510 --> 06:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um
 
06:06:02.708 --> 06:06:02.718 align:start position:0%
at the hearing on january 26
 
06:06:04.628 --> 06:06:04.638 align:start position:0%
when we were discussing or you were
 
06:06:07.110 --> 06:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
discussing presenting the initial bill
 
06:06:08.788 --> 06:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
he said the purpose of the bill is to
 
06:06:11.430 --> 06:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
save money it saves money by reducing
 
06:06:13.990 --> 06:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
extra staff and outsourcing
 
06:06:15.830 --> 06:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
and i asked about libraries he said we
 
06:06:17.030 --> 06:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
have public libraries and we talked
 
06:06:19.270 --> 06:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
about health and schools we have private
 
06:06:19.280 --> 06:06:20.230 align:start position:0%
about health and schools we have private
clubs

06:06:20.230 --> 06:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
clubs
 
06:06:22.390 --> 06:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
i have a real concern about
 
06:06:22.400 --> 06:06:23.510 align:start position:0%
i have a real concern about
this

06:06:23.510 --> 06:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:06:23.520 --> 06:06:24.948 align:start position:0%
this
uh

06:06:24.948 --> 06:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:06:26.390 --> 06:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
bill not about the conversion but
 
06:06:28.868 --> 06:06:28.878 align:start position:0%
conversion existing school
 
06:06:30.868 --> 06:06:30.878 align:start position:0%
um because i think it beyond
 
06:06:30.878 --> 06:06:32.788 align:start position:0%
um because i think it beyond
representative

06:06:32.788 --> 06:06:32.798 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:06:35.190 --> 06:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
ellison's concern about the union being
 
06:06:37.110 --> 06:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
hijacked turn the contract
 
06:06:39.590 --> 06:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
i see it as a union buster to be honest
 
06:06:40.948 --> 06:06:40.958 align:start position:0%
with you and not i'm sure that wasn't
 
06:06:43.030 --> 06:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
your intent rick i see it as a union
 
06:06:45.190 --> 06:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
buster because you get small school
 
06:06:46.868 --> 06:06:46.878 align:start position:0%
districts we have say three elementary
 
06:06:48.628 --> 06:06:48.638 align:start position:0%
schools you have group people say you
 
06:06:49.750 --> 06:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
know what we can't afford the three
 
06:06:51.430 --> 06:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
elementary schools so now we're going to
 
06:06:52.868 --> 06:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
come together and we'll we're going to
 
06:06:54.868 --> 06:06:54.878 align:start position:0%
we'll have one we'll make a conversion
 
06:06:57.590 --> 06:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
charter school now we jump into those
 
06:06:59.430 --> 06:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
teachers that are left well we can
 
06:07:00.788 --> 06:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
renegotiate the salary because the
 
06:07:02.948 --> 06:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
salary is changeable now and then we go
 
06:07:04.310 --> 06:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
to a charter school where only 50
 
06:07:05.990 --> 06:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
percent of the teachers in there have to
 
06:07:07.830 --> 06:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
be certified teachers so it becomes a
 
06:07:07.840 --> 06:07:09.030 align:start position:0%
be certified teachers so it becomes a
huge

06:07:09.030 --> 06:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
huge
 
06:07:11.590 --> 06:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
savings for that community and then if
 
06:07:13.030 --> 06:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
you outsource any of the services the
 
06:07:15.510 --> 06:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
tech services the librarian services
 
06:07:16.948 --> 06:07:16.958 align:start position:0%
the purpose here is not to improve
 
06:07:18.548 --> 06:07:18.558 align:start position:0%
education it wasn't converted into a
 
06:07:19.990 --> 06:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
thematic charter school it was
 
06:07:21.670 --> 06:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
recommended by the teachers it wasn't
 
06:07:23.270 --> 06:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
something that came internal up this is
 
06:07:25.350 --> 06:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
strictly a dollar savings i think it
 
06:07:27.590 --> 06:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
puts public education and public
 
06:07:30.708 --> 06:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
teachers and public education at risk i
 
06:07:32.868 --> 06:07:32.878 align:start position:0%
don't i don't think this is a good bill
 
06:07:35.990 --> 06:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
at all for those reasons um and i will
 
06:07:37.510 --> 06:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
not be supporting it
 
06:07:40.310 --> 06:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
06:07:43.510 --> 06:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's yes representatives
 
06:07:46.150 --> 06:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
yes i just wanted to
 
06:07:48.628 --> 06:07:48.638 align:start position:0%
say that it's not i don't i'm not sure
 
06:07:51.430 --> 06:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
who said and it doesn't matter all about
 
06:07:53.430 --> 06:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
money but
 
06:07:56.628 --> 06:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
i see it also as giving the local town
 
06:07:56.638 --> 06:07:57.750 align:start position:0%
i see it also as giving the local town
more

06:07:57.750 --> 06:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
more
 
06:07:59.990 --> 06:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
options and flexibility with what they
 
06:08:01.830 --> 06:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
do and how they run their school the
 
06:08:03.910 --> 06:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
hours they run their school when they
 
06:08:07.430 --> 06:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
are open all kinds of things that um
 
06:08:09.750 --> 06:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
that doing a charter public school
 
06:08:09.760 --> 06:08:10.788 align:start position:0%
that doing a charter public school
because

06:22:55.670 --> 06:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
aggrieved
 
06:22:57.430 --> 06:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
including attorney general may initiate
 
06:22:59.430 --> 06:22:59.440 align:start position:0%

district or school board in superior
 
06:23:04.150 --> 06:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
court i i just took out other entity and
 
06:23:06.468 --> 06:23:06.478 align:start position:0%
then i dropped
 
06:23:09.350 --> 06:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
the third paragraph because again i see
 
06:23:10.468 --> 06:23:10.478 align:start position:0%
no reason
 
06:23:12.868 --> 06:23:12.878 align:start position:0%
um that that be there
 
06:23:14.868 --> 06:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
uh because the educator is just doing
 
06:23:18.070 --> 06:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
what the the superintendent and school
 
06:23:19.830 --> 06:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh policy is
 
06:23:22.788 --> 06:23:22.798 align:start position:0%
and um they're just in in
 
06:23:25.270 --> 06:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
doing their job and the other thing is
 
06:23:28.868 --> 06:23:28.878 align:start position:0%
that i really am offended by taking um
 
06:23:30.948 --> 06:23:30.958 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct and making it you
 
06:23:32.628 --> 06:23:32.638 align:start position:0%
know um
 
06:23:33.830 --> 06:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
a tool
 
06:23:35.990 --> 06:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh to attack so
 
06:23:40.070 --> 06:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:40.080 --> 06:23:46.788 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:23:46.788 --> 06:23:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:49.030 --> 06:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
i think the code of conduct was good but
 
06:23:50.948 --> 06:23:50.958 align:start position:0%
when you use it as
 
06:23:53.030 --> 06:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
a sledgehammer like this it's it's just
 
06:23:56.548 --> 06:23:56.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:58.230 --> 06:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion from
 
06:23:59.910 --> 06:23:59.920 align:start position:0%

my concern that i expressed yesterday
 
06:24:10.548 --> 06:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
over the superintendent of schools being
 
06:24:14.150 --> 06:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
taken out of the chain of command
 
06:24:16.628 --> 06:24:16.638 align:start position:0%

06:24:18.468 --> 06:24:18.478 align:start position:0%
uh sorry just in representative
 
06:24:21.750 --> 06:24:21.760 align:start position:0%

we had some discussion in here about the
 
06:24:28.390 --> 06:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
role of the board of trustees in a
 
06:24:30.468 --> 06:24:30.478 align:start position:0%
chartered school with regards to the
 
06:24:32.548 --> 06:24:32.558 align:start position:0%
daily operation
 
06:24:35.670 --> 06:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at page 592
 
06:24:38.310 --> 06:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
in our law book where it says
 
06:24:40.310 --> 06:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools authority and
 
06:24:42.230 --> 06:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
duties of the board of trustees roman
 
06:24:43.910 --> 06:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
numeral one
 
06:24:46.150 --> 06:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
unless otherwise provided in this
 
06:24:48.070 --> 06:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
chapter the board of trustees of a
 
06:24:50.390 --> 06:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
chartered public school upon issuance of
 
06:24:51.750 --> 06:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
its charter
 
06:24:54.708 --> 06:24:54.718 align:start position:0%
shall have general supervisory control
 
06:24:57.350 --> 06:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
and authority over the operations of the
 
06:24:59.350 --> 06:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
chartered public school
 
06:25:03.030 --> 06:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
and then on page 600 under
 
06:25:06.868 --> 06:25:06.878 align:start position:0%
194b roman 13
 
06:25:09.750 --> 06:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools operations it
 
06:25:09.760 --> 06:25:11.590 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools operations it
says

06:25:11.590 --> 06:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
says
 
06:25:13.670 --> 06:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
the board of roman three the board of
 
06:25:15.990 --> 06:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
trustees in consultation with teachers
 
06:25:17.750 --> 06:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
and the principal shall determine the
 
06:25:19.830 --> 06:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools curriculum and
 
06:25:21.990 --> 06:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
develop the annual budget
 
06:25:24.230 --> 06:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
roman four the board of trustees shall
 
06:25:26.230 --> 06:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
be considered the public employer for
 
06:25:29.030 --> 06:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
the purposes of collective bargaining
 
06:25:32.150 --> 06:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
so i i think that this uh portrayal that
 
06:25:33.830 --> 06:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
we had yesterday that the board of
 
06:25:36.548 --> 06:25:36.558 align:start position:0%
trustees is only about the financial
 
06:25:40.390 --> 06:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
operation of a charter school was not
 
06:25:42.390 --> 06:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
a complete picture
 
06:25:46.628 --> 06:25:46.638 align:start position:0%
and so um my concern is that you've got
 
06:25:48.788 --> 06:25:48.798 align:start position:0%
a school board
 
06:25:50.868 --> 06:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
from the public school making this
 
06:25:50.878 --> 06:25:52.788 align:start position:0%
from the public school making this
determination

06:25:52.788 --> 06:25:52.798 align:start position:0%
determination
 
06:25:55.510 --> 06:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
and not the superintendent
 
06:25:58.070 --> 06:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
the chief executive officer of the
 
06:26:00.150 --> 06:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
chartered public school
 
06:26:02.628 --> 06:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
but not the board of trustees
 
06:26:02.638 --> 06:26:03.830 align:start position:0%
but not the board of trustees
so

06:26:03.830 --> 06:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:26:06.548 --> 06:26:06.558 align:start position:0%
i i think there's an inconsistency there
 
06:26:09.110 --> 06:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
between the governance of the two
 
06:26:13.830 --> 06:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
entities and uh i i just
 
06:26:15.990 --> 06:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
i i have a i have a hard time
 
06:26:18.310 --> 06:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
06:26:20.948 --> 06:26:20.958 align:start position:0%
thank you uh ref sent cordelli uh thank
 
06:26:23.910 --> 06:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
you i um neglected to point out one
 
06:26:26.628 --> 06:26:26.638 align:start position:0%
other thing in this amendment because it
 
06:26:30.628 --> 06:26:30.638 align:start position:0%
was based on a prior amendment
 
06:26:32.310 --> 06:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
but in
 
06:26:32.320 --> 06:26:34.310 align:start position:0%
but in
998

06:26:34.310 --> 06:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
998
 
06:26:34.320 --> 06:26:36.788 align:start position:0%
998
h

06:26:36.788 --> 06:26:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:38.948 --> 06:26:38.958 align:start position:0%
non-public schools are not
 
06:26:41.350 --> 06:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
included in this
 
06:26:43.670 --> 06:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
whereas in
 
06:26:47.990 --> 06:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative tanner's amendment 1003
 
06:26:50.070 --> 06:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
non-public schools
 
06:26:50.080 --> 06:26:51.110 align:start position:0%
non-public schools
are

06:26:51.110 --> 06:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:26:51.120 --> 06:26:52.468 align:start position:0%
are
included

06:26:52.468 --> 06:26:52.478 align:start position:0%
included
 
06:26:54.070 --> 06:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
in that and i think that that's a
 
06:26:59.350 --> 06:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:00.948 --> 06:27:00.958 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion from the
 
06:27:00.958 --> 06:27:02.390 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion from the
committee

06:27:02.390 --> 06:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:27:04.390 --> 06:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
may i just make a statement about the
 
06:27:06.628 --> 06:27:06.638 align:start position:0%
non-public school um it's each
 
06:27:09.350 --> 06:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
accredited non-public schools so i
 
06:27:10.948 --> 06:27:10.958 align:start position:0%
assume that's through the
 
06:27:12.948 --> 06:27:12.958 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
06:27:14.628 --> 06:27:14.638 align:start position:0%
um and it may be schools that are
 
06:27:14.638 --> 06:27:16.070 align:start position:0%
um and it may be schools that are
contracted

06:27:16.070 --> 06:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
contracted
 
06:27:18.628 --> 06:27:18.638 align:start position:0%
with public schools so
 
06:27:27.750 --> 06:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:29.910 --> 06:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
we do have some
 
06:27:32.948 --> 06:27:32.958 align:start position:0%
private schools which are accredited
 
06:27:35.750 --> 06:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
that are totally separate apart from
 
06:27:37.350 --> 06:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
you know public schools
 
06:27:40.150 --> 06:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
that's that system you know
 
06:27:42.390 --> 06:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
for example like holderness school
 
06:27:44.868 --> 06:27:44.878 align:start position:0%
it's a private school
 
06:27:47.510 --> 06:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
but it's unto itself too the plymouth
 
06:27:49.430 --> 06:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
high school takes all the kids
 
06:27:51.030 --> 06:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:27:53.030 --> 06:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
they're in and and holderness is of
 
06:27:54.548 --> 06:27:54.558 align:start position:0%
course credited
 
06:27:57.430 --> 06:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
through nichi so is it also approved by
 
06:27:58.948 --> 06:27:58.958 align:start position:0%
the state
 
06:28:00.390 --> 06:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh i i
 
06:28:02.310 --> 06:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't tell you that i get confused
 
06:28:02.320 --> 06:28:03.430 align:start position:0%
couldn't tell you that i get confused
with

06:28:03.430 --> 06:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:28:05.910 --> 06:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
um accreditation which i know is through
 
06:28:08.150 --> 06:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
the you know third party
 
06:28:10.070 --> 06:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
um new england association new england
 
06:28:12.390 --> 06:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
association of schools and colleges
 
06:28:13.910 --> 06:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
um and
 
06:28:16.628 --> 06:28:16.638 align:start position:0%
the approval by this by the state
 
06:28:19.990 --> 06:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
department of education which approves
 
06:28:22.708 --> 06:28:22.718 align:start position:0%
non-public schools for tuition purposes
 
06:28:24.628 --> 06:28:24.638 align:start position:0%
and and so i get kind of confused
 
06:28:29.590 --> 06:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:31.190 --> 06:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
yeah the the commission has the
 
06:28:33.190 --> 06:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
authority to do that too and i i just
 
06:28:34.708 --> 06:28:34.718 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's been done i know it
 
06:28:36.868 --> 06:28:36.878 align:start position:0%
was done like for fryeburg academy that
 
06:28:37.990 --> 06:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
was done
 
06:28:39.270 --> 06:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
that's not in our state but the
 
06:28:40.628 --> 06:28:40.638 align:start position:0%
commissioner has the authority to
 
06:28:42.948 --> 06:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
approve that school the the
 
06:28:45.510 --> 06:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
educate the new hampshire commissioner
 
06:28:47.110 --> 06:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
yes and then
 
06:28:49.270 --> 06:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
um and holderness could be approved by
 
06:28:51.110 --> 06:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
the department of education if it was
 
06:28:53.190 --> 06:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
taking yeah
 
06:28:53.200 --> 06:28:54.948 align:start position:0%
taking yeah
so

06:28:54.948 --> 06:28:54.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:28:56.628 --> 06:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead rep
 
06:28:56.638 --> 06:28:58.548 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead rep
yes

06:28:58.548 --> 06:28:58.558 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:29:00.628 --> 06:29:00.638 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
06:29:02.468 --> 06:29:02.478 align:start position:0%
one of the topics that was just brought
 
06:29:04.390 --> 06:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
up was that the superintendent was being
 
06:29:06.230 --> 06:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
bypassed the superintendent reports to
 
06:29:07.510 --> 06:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
the school board the school board
 
06:29:09.830 --> 06:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
dictates what the superintendent does
 
06:29:12.468 --> 06:29:12.478 align:start position:0%
so whether he's in here or not
 
06:29:14.868 --> 06:29:14.878 align:start position:0%
the superintendent has to report to the
 
06:29:17.510 --> 06:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
school board the school board is the
 
06:29:20.230 --> 06:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
superintendent's boss
 
06:29:20.240 --> 06:29:21.510 align:start position:0%
superintendent's boss
right

06:29:21.510 --> 06:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:29:23.670 --> 06:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
i recognize that representative johnson
 
06:29:25.910 --> 06:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying that my
 
06:29:27.590 --> 06:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
question was not
 
06:29:31.430 --> 06:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
my question was it looks like we've got
 
06:29:34.230 --> 06:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
one head of building or one head of
 
06:29:38.628 --> 06:29:38.638 align:start position:0%
of staff and not the board in charge in
 
06:29:41.110 --> 06:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
one situation
 
06:29:42.390 --> 06:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
the school board and not the
 
06:29:42.400 --> 06:29:43.750 align:start position:0%
the school board and not the
superintendent

06:29:43.750 --> 06:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
06:29:46.468 --> 06:29:46.478 align:start position:0%
in the other situation we've got the
 
06:29:48.390 --> 06:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
person who's in charge you know the the
 
06:29:51.430 --> 06:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
principal the the head of the charter
 
06:29:54.628 --> 06:29:54.638 align:start position:0%
school and not the board of trustees i i
 
06:29:56.230 --> 06:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
what i was saying was that i would have
 
06:29:56.240 --> 06:29:57.270 align:start position:0%
what i was saying was that i would have
thought

06:29:57.270 --> 06:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
thought
 
06:29:59.830 --> 06:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
that it would have been uh the school
 
06:30:03.190 --> 06:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
board and the board of trustees
 
06:30:03.200 --> 06:30:04.230 align:start position:0%
board and the board of trustees
or

06:30:04.230 --> 06:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:30:04.240 --> 06:30:05.350 align:start position:0%
or
or

06:30:05.350 --> 06:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:30:07.590 --> 06:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
the chief operating officer and the
 
06:30:10.468 --> 06:30:10.478 align:start position:0%
superintendent but not one in one
 
06:30:15.190 --> 06:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:16.788 --> 06:30:16.798 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
06:30:18.230 --> 06:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
okay we're
 
06:30:18.240 --> 06:30:19.590 align:start position:0%
okay we're
yes

06:30:19.590 --> 06:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:30:23.030 --> 06:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
so just just quickly mr chair so um
 
06:30:24.868 --> 06:30:24.878 align:start position:0%
looking at the original bill and looking
 
06:30:27.510 --> 06:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
at at both amendments the original bill
 
06:30:29.270 --> 06:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
talks about accredited non-public
 
06:30:31.510 --> 06:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
schools property on line seven
 
06:30:33.270 --> 06:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
the tanner bill
 
06:30:36.548 --> 06:30:36.558 align:start position:0%
of tanner amendment um i think repeats
 
06:30:39.030 --> 06:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
that same that same accredited
 
06:30:41.990 --> 06:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
non-public school property and the
 
06:30:44.948 --> 06:30:44.958 align:start position:0%
the cordelli one eliminates the
 
06:30:51.270 --> 06:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:53.990 --> 06:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
to these these schools property
 
06:30:55.350 --> 06:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
referring to the
 
06:30:57.110 --> 06:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
the you know what's discussed in line
 
06:31:00.468 --> 06:31:00.478 align:start position:0%
five six five five and six but on the
 
06:31:02.230 --> 06:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
original bill and on the tanner
 
06:31:03.830 --> 06:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
amendment when it talks about an
 
06:31:07.590 --> 06:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
accredited non-public schools property
 
06:31:09.350 --> 06:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
is is
 
06:31:11.350 --> 06:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
does that mean netchie accredited or
 
06:31:15.030 --> 06:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
does that mean department approved
 
06:31:16.310 --> 06:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
it's wide open there's a lot of
 
06:31:18.390 --> 06:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
accrediting organizations it's not just
 
06:31:19.910 --> 06:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
the new england associate various
 
06:31:22.548 --> 06:31:22.558 align:start position:0%
christian accrediting agencies and right
 
06:31:25.110 --> 06:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
and it goes on so so but i i think in
 
06:31:25.830 --> 06:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
the cu
 
06:31:29.510 --> 06:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
in the context of what 1131 is is
 
06:31:30.868 --> 06:31:30.878 align:start position:0%
looking to do
 
06:31:32.150 --> 06:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
a credit
 
06:31:34.948 --> 06:31:34.958 align:start position:0%
whether they're academically accredited
 
06:31:37.190 --> 06:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
is less
 
06:31:39.110 --> 06:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
relevant than whether they're department
 
06:31:42.548 --> 06:31:42.558 align:start position:0%
approved for providing um the the
 
06:31:44.390 --> 06:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
content of an adequate education because
 
06:31:47.110 --> 06:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
that's the approval standards that we
 
06:31:49.110 --> 06:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
that we considered in
 
06:31:49.120 --> 06:31:51.270 align:start position:0%
that we considered in
1671

06:31:51.270 --> 06:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
1671
 
06:31:54.150 --> 06:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
that's the approval standard right
 
06:31:56.310 --> 06:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
you're approved to deliver
 
06:31:58.868 --> 06:31:58.878 align:start position:0%
an adequate education
 
06:32:01.190 --> 06:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
so so um
 
06:32:02.868 --> 06:32:02.878 align:start position:0%
in the original bill and in the tanner
 
06:32:02.878 --> 06:32:03.830 align:start position:0%
in the original bill and in the tanner
amendment

06:32:03.830 --> 06:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:32:05.510 --> 06:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
would it make sense that they're really
 
06:32:08.430 --> 06:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
referring to approved
 
06:32:10.390 --> 06:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
non-approved non-public schools
 
06:32:11.830 --> 06:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
non-public schools who can deliver an
 
06:32:14.150 --> 06:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
adequate education um
 
06:32:16.150 --> 06:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
undercurrent to meet the minimum public
 
06:32:17.990 --> 06:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
standards for public schools
 
06:32:20.150 --> 06:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
right right it's really approval not
 
06:32:22.390 --> 06:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
accreditation yeah
 
06:32:22.400 --> 06:32:26.310 align:start position:0%
accreditation yeah
yes

06:32:26.310 --> 06:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:27.750 --> 06:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
06:32:31.190 --> 06:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
my understanding from the
 
06:32:33.910 --> 06:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
board of the
 
06:32:35.750 --> 06:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
some representative
 
06:32:37.910 --> 06:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
of the doe
 
06:32:40.628 --> 06:32:40.638 align:start position:0%
was that that approval
 
06:32:44.548 --> 06:32:44.558 align:start position:0%
is for the attendance part
 
06:32:46.788 --> 06:32:46.798 align:start position:0%
is is it not i mean
 
06:32:49.350 --> 06:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
when they went to court over this i was
 
06:32:51.030 --> 06:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
at the court case and they were saying
 
06:32:53.830 --> 06:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
that it was for attendance
 
06:32:56.310 --> 06:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
so in order to be in order to say so a
 
06:32:59.270 --> 06:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
kid isn't delinquent they can go to a
 
06:33:00.868 --> 06:33:00.878 align:start position:0%
public school or they can go to a
 
06:33:02.868 --> 06:33:02.878 align:start position:0%
private school that's approved by the
 
06:33:04.468 --> 06:33:04.478 align:start position:0%
state and the state said that's what
 
06:33:06.390 --> 06:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
they were approving it
 
06:33:08.548 --> 06:33:08.558 align:start position:0%
for that it was adequate and yeah they
 
06:33:10.628 --> 06:33:10.638 align:start position:0%
have to fill out all kinds of paperwork
 
06:33:11.910 --> 06:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
and submit all their stuff and
 
06:33:13.190 --> 06:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
everything but
 
06:33:15.590 --> 06:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's still a private school
 
06:33:17.190 --> 06:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
and should we be
 
06:33:19.910 --> 06:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
putting laws like this on a private
 
06:33:22.390 --> 06:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
school it's it's not a publicly funded
 
06:33:24.548 --> 06:33:24.558 align:start position:0%
it's not in anything it's still private
 
06:33:27.030 --> 06:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
schools should we be
 
06:33:31.510 --> 06:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:34.070 --> 06:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
i'm i'd have to go back and look at into
 
06:33:37.190 --> 06:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
the rules but there's two different
 
06:33:40.070 --> 06:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
levels of approval
 
06:33:42.548 --> 06:33:42.558 align:start position:0%
now you can have the uh
 
06:33:42.558 --> 06:33:45.510 align:start position:0%
now you can have the uh
minimum

06:33:45.510 --> 06:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:46.948 --> 06:33:46.958 align:start position:0%
the what i have in front of me right
 
06:33:49.430 --> 06:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
here the public school approval
 
06:33:51.990 --> 06:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
standards right here uh
 
06:33:53.190 --> 06:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public school
 
06:33:55.350 --> 06:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
approval there's another level which is
 
06:33:57.270 --> 06:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
lesser than this
 
06:34:00.468 --> 06:34:00.478 align:start position:0%
and i'm just trying to recall all these
 
06:34:02.628 --> 06:34:02.638 align:start position:0%
for attendance approval for attendance
 
06:34:03.990 --> 06:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
but there's other areas within
 
06:34:05.750 --> 06:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
attendance which also deal with some of
 
06:34:08.708 --> 06:34:08.718 align:start position:0%
the basic safety issues and that
 
06:34:12.310 --> 06:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
codes that were of health and
 
06:34:14.310 --> 06:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
that type of thing is in that level of
 
06:34:17.030 --> 06:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
attendance approval
 
06:34:18.310 --> 06:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
we we dealt with that when we were
 
06:34:21.350 --> 06:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
looking at tuition tuition programs in
 
06:34:22.628 --> 06:34:22.638 align:start position:0%
our schools
 
06:34:24.310 --> 06:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
yes representative cordelli
 
06:34:27.990 --> 06:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh yeah i think that uh
 
06:34:31.350 --> 06:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
representative uh lakers uh um
 
06:34:33.510 --> 06:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
touched on it in that uh
 
06:34:36.628 --> 06:34:36.638 align:start position:0%
um i think one of the problems with the
 
06:34:37.990 --> 06:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
06:34:39.270 --> 06:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
was the
 
06:34:42.948 --> 06:34:42.958 align:start position:0%
inclusion of the non-public schools and
 
06:34:44.628 --> 06:34:44.638 align:start position:0%
i know in discussion
 
06:34:44.638 --> 06:34:46.390 align:start position:0%
i know in discussion
with

06:34:46.390 --> 06:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:34:49.030 --> 06:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
at least one of the sponsors
 
06:34:51.750 --> 06:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
they agreed with that
 
06:34:55.430 --> 06:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
and that it probably should be removed
 
06:34:58.468 --> 06:34:58.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:00.390 --> 06:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things i tried to accomplish
 
06:35:01.510 --> 06:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
in these
 
06:35:01.520 --> 06:35:03.270 align:start position:0%
in these
plus

06:35:03.270 --> 06:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
plus
 
06:35:05.030 --> 06:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
i think was representative ladd had a
 
06:35:07.990 --> 06:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
question about what other entity um was
 
06:35:09.990 --> 06:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
referring to so that's why we made the
 
06:35:12.150 --> 06:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
other change
 
06:35:14.390 --> 06:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes
 
06:35:17.670 --> 06:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
so so i looked up the
 
06:35:17.680 --> 06:35:18.390 align:start position:0%
so so i looked up the
the

06:35:18.390 --> 06:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:35:21.830 --> 06:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
rsa that this bill refers to uh 189
 
06:35:23.190 --> 06:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
colon 10
 
06:35:26.070 --> 06:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
and it adds a new section to it but the
 
06:35:26.080 --> 06:35:26.868 align:start position:0%
and it adds a new section to it but the
sec

06:35:26.868 --> 06:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
sec
 
06:35:28.788 --> 06:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make any sense that it's even
 
06:35:28.798 --> 06:35:30.708 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make any sense that it's even
there

06:35:30.708 --> 06:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:35:34.070 --> 06:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
that section is called is titled studies
 
06:35:36.310 --> 06:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
um and it says the school board shall
 
06:35:38.150 --> 06:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
ensure the health education and physical
 
06:35:39.910 --> 06:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
education are taught to pupils as part
 
06:35:42.948 --> 06:35:42.958 align:start position:0%
of the basic curriculum
 
06:35:45.350 --> 06:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
and it just it goes down and itemizes
 
06:35:46.708 --> 06:35:46.718 align:start position:0%
the things that should be taught in
 
06:35:48.628 --> 06:35:48.638 align:start position:0%
health and phys ed
 
06:35:48.638 --> 06:35:49.750 align:start position:0%
health and phys ed
um

06:35:49.750 --> 06:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:51.670 --> 06:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
and and then
 
06:35:53.750 --> 06:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden this bill appears
 
06:35:55.750 --> 06:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
or would appear right after that just
 
06:35:55.760 --> 06:35:56.628 align:start position:0%
or would appear right after that just
it's

06:35:56.628 --> 06:35:56.638 align:start position:0%
it's
 
06:35:59.030 --> 06:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
looks totally out of place
 
06:36:00.468 --> 06:36:00.478 align:start position:0%
where it is i
 
06:36:02.548 --> 06:36:02.558 align:start position:0%
at this point i would say that
 
06:36:04.468 --> 06:36:04.478 align:start position:0%
maybe it needs
 
06:36:09.190 --> 06:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:16.310 --> 06:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:18.548 --> 06:36:18.558 align:start position:0%
well i tend to agree with you on that um
 
06:36:20.150 --> 06:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
i i think that
 
06:36:22.468 --> 06:36:22.478 align:start position:0%
uh what we've done with
 
06:36:25.110 --> 06:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
much of our statutory language we pluck
 
06:36:27.910 --> 06:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
stuff into certain areas and this is one
 
06:36:29.910 --> 06:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
which i've spoken to in the last several
 
06:36:31.830 --> 06:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
days quite often
 
06:36:34.788 --> 06:36:34.798 align:start position:0%
that this is an area that we need to be
 
06:36:34.798 --> 06:36:36.230 align:start position:0%
that this is an area that we need to be
parking

06:36:36.230 --> 06:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
parking
 
06:36:38.628 --> 06:36:38.638 align:start position:0%
some of the definition further what
 
06:36:40.310 --> 06:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
these studies are in fact even when i
 
06:36:42.628 --> 06:36:42.638 align:start position:0%
was talking about 1671 today i mentioned
 
06:36:44.310 --> 06:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
the word studies
 
06:36:47.430 --> 06:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
we have the learning areas but within
 
06:36:49.350 --> 06:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
learning areas you have certain studies
 
06:36:50.788 --> 06:36:50.798 align:start position:0%
and that's where we parked health
 
06:36:52.548 --> 06:36:52.558 align:start position:0%
physical education some of the issues
 
06:36:55.270 --> 06:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
with health and we've also now parked in
 
06:36:55.280 --> 06:36:56.708 align:start position:0%
with health and we've also now parked in
um

06:36:56.708 --> 06:36:56.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:58.628 --> 06:36:58.638 align:start position:0%
personal finance literacy in there as
 
06:37:00.868 --> 06:37:00.878 align:start position:0%
far as how to embed it and how to tie it
 
06:37:01.990 --> 06:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
into your
 
06:37:04.468 --> 06:37:04.478 align:start position:0%
your your learning areas
 
06:37:07.270 --> 06:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
so there and there's need to do we also
 
06:37:09.510 --> 06:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
have instruction in there the history of
 
06:37:11.510 --> 06:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
our country and and some of the civics
 
06:37:14.310 --> 06:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
is parked in the 189 section
 
06:37:14.320 --> 06:37:15.990 align:start position:0%
is parked in the 189 section
um

06:37:15.990 --> 06:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:17.590 --> 06:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
it would seem that this would be under
 
06:37:19.750 --> 06:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
safety or health and safety of the
 
06:37:22.230 --> 06:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
buildings food and nutrition is there
 
06:37:25.830 --> 06:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
you go on through everything in 189 447
 
06:37:28.310 --> 06:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
is the page i have yeah
 
06:37:28.320 --> 06:37:30.788 align:start position:0%
is the page i have yeah
yes

06:37:30.788 --> 06:37:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:32.390 --> 06:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
it says
 
06:37:34.150 --> 06:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
new section
 
06:37:37.750 --> 06:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
and it puts it after not in but after
 
06:37:37.760 --> 06:37:39.670 align:start position:0%
and it puts it after not in but after
189

06:37:39.670 --> 06:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
189
 
06:37:42.628 --> 06:37:42.638 align:start position:0%
as a new section after section 10 the
 
06:37:45.590 --> 06:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
following news section and so
 
06:37:47.750 --> 06:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
that whole section has all kinds of
 
06:37:51.430 --> 06:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:53.510 --> 06:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to make of that i i
 
06:37:56.310 --> 06:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
got that and i understand that 189 is
 
06:37:57.670 --> 06:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
about school board superintendents
 
06:37:59.430 --> 06:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
teachers truant officers and school
 
06:37:59.440 --> 06:38:00.548 align:start position:0%
teachers truant officers and school
census

06:38:00.548 --> 06:38:00.558 align:start position:0%
census
 
06:38:02.708 --> 06:38:02.718 align:start position:0%
that's the whole name of that chapter
 
06:38:02.718 --> 06:38:04.948 align:start position:0%
that's the whole name of that chapter
so

06:38:04.948 --> 06:38:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:06.150 --> 06:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
but we're going to see things right
 
06:38:08.468 --> 06:38:08.478 align:start position:0%
beside like this and it's just makes it
 
06:38:10.150 --> 06:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
seem kind of convoluted and hard to
 
06:38:12.390 --> 06:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
follow but yeah you're right it is a
 
06:38:16.230 --> 06:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:18.628 --> 06:38:18.638 align:start position:0%
separate section but it's under studies
 
06:38:20.708 --> 06:38:20.718 align:start position:0%
yes that's right it's
 
06:38:24.708 --> 06:38:24.718 align:start position:0%
it would be uh 10a which would be 189
 
06:38:32.868 --> 06:38:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:32.878 --> 06:38:33.750 align:start position:0%
 
right

06:38:33.750 --> 06:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:38:36.310 --> 06:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
with within with a new title facial
 
06:38:38.230 --> 06:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
covering policy
 
06:38:47.430 --> 06:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:48.708 --> 06:38:48.718 align:start position:0%
well it 189.00 talks about what the
 
06:38:50.548 --> 06:38:50.558 align:start position:0%
school board has to do it shall do this
 
06:38:52.310 --> 06:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
it shall do that and that's what all the
 
06:39:11.750 --> 06:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:13.510 --> 06:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
okay so we got to get beyond the
 
06:39:14.628 --> 06:39:14.638 align:start position:0%
discussion point here we're gonna have
 
06:39:16.070 --> 06:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
to have a motion put on the floor so we
 
06:39:17.590 --> 06:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
can start moving here so represent
 
06:39:19.510 --> 06:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
cordelia do you have a motion all right
 
06:39:20.548 --> 06:39:20.558 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
06:39:23.590 --> 06:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
on house one one one three
 
06:39:25.750 --> 06:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
06:39:27.990 --> 06:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
julius uh represents
 
06:39:43.190 --> 06:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:45.830 --> 06:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay okay do you care to
 
06:39:47.830 --> 06:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
talk to your
 
06:39:47.840 --> 06:39:48.628 align:start position:0%
talk to your
uh

06:39:48.628 --> 06:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:39:51.270 --> 06:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
just uh the fact that um
 
06:39:53.430 --> 06:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
even in discussion with uh one of the
 
06:39:56.788 --> 06:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
sponsors uh we recognized the issue of
 
06:39:59.750 --> 06:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
including non-public schools in here
 
06:40:00.868 --> 06:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
and that
 
06:40:02.548 --> 06:40:02.558 align:start position:0%
generated the
 
06:40:05.910 --> 06:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
thought for uh amendment
 
06:40:09.590 --> 06:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes representative
 
06:40:09.600 --> 06:40:12.548 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes representative
woodcock

06:40:12.548 --> 06:40:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:15.030 --> 06:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
just two points i'd like to reiterate i
 
06:40:17.110 --> 06:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
concur with representative tanner on the
 
06:40:19.430 --> 06:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
violation of section three
 
06:40:22.468 --> 06:40:22.478 align:start position:0%
um that deals with teachers teachers are
 
06:40:24.390 --> 06:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
under the jurisdiction of the
 
06:40:24.400 --> 06:40:25.190 align:start position:0%
under the jurisdiction of the
the

06:40:25.190 --> 06:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:40:27.510 --> 06:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
the school principal and and the
 
06:40:27.520 --> 06:40:28.948 align:start position:0%
the school principal and and the
administration

06:40:28.948 --> 06:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
administration
 
06:40:32.390 --> 06:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
and to have them have disciplinary
 
06:40:34.868 --> 06:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
options additionally infractions on the
 
06:40:36.948 --> 06:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
record uh even after as far as the state
 
06:40:38.390 --> 06:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
board because they've fallen what
 
06:40:39.830 --> 06:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be doing i think
 
06:40:41.830 --> 06:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
that's a real conflict there and very
 
06:40:43.190 --> 06:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
difficult for the teachers to do know
 
06:40:45.430 --> 06:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
what to do and i also agree that it
 
06:40:47.430 --> 06:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense to me starting
 
06:40:49.110 --> 06:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
adding something that is a health and
 
06:40:50.310 --> 06:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
safety issue
 
06:40:52.628 --> 06:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
under a studies category when we know
 
06:40:55.590 --> 06:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
it's in the wrong place to start with
 
06:40:57.190 --> 06:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:40:59.510 --> 06:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
06:40:59.520 --> 06:41:00.468 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
yes

06:41:00.468 --> 06:41:00.478 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:41:01.830 --> 06:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
represent mullen
 
06:41:03.830 --> 06:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
with regards to that teacher code of
 
06:41:07.190 --> 06:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
conduct i i i mean it specifically says
 
06:41:09.830 --> 06:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
that the state board of education is
 
06:41:12.150 --> 06:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
going to weigh in on this
 
06:41:14.548 --> 06:41:14.558 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:41:18.150 --> 06:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:21.270 --> 06:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
it's there's a graduated ladder of
 
06:41:24.070 --> 06:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
disciplinary measures is that taken into
 
06:41:28.468 --> 06:41:28.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:30.548 --> 06:41:30.558 align:start position:0%
if it's going to reference to that code
 
06:41:31.590 --> 06:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
it would
 
06:41:33.430 --> 06:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh reps uh
 
06:41:33.440 --> 06:41:34.708 align:start position:0%
uh reps uh
representative

06:41:34.708 --> 06:41:34.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:41:37.110 --> 06:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
diane are you willing to come up and
 
06:41:58.468 --> 06:41:58.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:58.478 --> 06:42:08.468 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:42:08.468 --> 06:42:08.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:11.750 --> 06:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
so my question is that we've we've had
 
06:42:13.830 --> 06:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
discussion before on the code of ethics
 
06:42:16.830 --> 06:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:19.510 --> 06:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
and yeah well the yeah the code of
 
06:42:20.948 --> 06:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
conduct the the
 
06:42:22.788 --> 06:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
the others assurance but
 
06:42:22.798 --> 06:42:24.150 align:start position:0%
the others assurance but
um

06:42:24.150 --> 06:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:24.160 --> 06:42:26.628 align:start position:0%
um
is

06:42:26.628 --> 06:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:29.990 --> 06:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
when we we discussed the the prior bill
 
06:42:31.750 --> 06:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
it was decided that
 
06:42:33.910 --> 06:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't as legislature get into the
 
06:42:35.830 --> 06:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
business of trying to
 
06:42:38.310 --> 06:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
craft or write language now this is not
 
06:42:40.150 --> 06:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
crafting any language
 
06:42:43.030 --> 06:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
this is saying that you do this you're
 
06:42:44.948 --> 06:42:44.958 align:start position:0%
going to it's going to be there's going
 
06:42:47.750 --> 06:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
to be this as a response possibly
 
06:42:47.760 --> 06:42:48.948 align:start position:0%
to be this as a response possibly
um

06:42:48.948 --> 06:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:51.030 --> 06:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
how's this fit in with the code of
 
06:42:51.040 --> 06:42:53.350 align:start position:0%
how's this fit in with the code of
conduct

06:42:53.350 --> 06:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
06:42:55.670 --> 06:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
is it something which should be done
 
06:42:57.670 --> 06:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
another way than we're doing here or is
 
06:43:00.708 --> 06:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
this an appropriate of course we can do
 
06:43:03.030 --> 06:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
legislatively we can do it but i'm just
 
06:43:04.868 --> 06:43:04.878 align:start position:0%
trying to find out where does it stand
 
06:43:07.350 --> 06:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
06:43:09.030 --> 06:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
compatibility with what we did in the
 
06:43:16.230 --> 06:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:18.628 --> 06:43:18.638 align:start position:0%
thank you so for the record diana fenton
 
06:43:20.628 --> 06:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
with the department of education so the
 
06:43:22.788 --> 06:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
code of conduct was established and it
 
06:43:24.708 --> 06:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
is in 21
 
06:43:24.718 --> 06:43:25.990 align:start position:0%
is in 21
and

06:43:25.990 --> 06:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:43:29.910 --> 06:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
do you need a copy i do actually um
 
06:43:32.230 --> 06:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
so statutorily
 
06:43:33.750 --> 06:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
it's in
 
06:43:36.548 --> 06:43:36.558 align:start position:0%
21 and nine i believe and it sets out
 
06:43:37.750 --> 06:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
the four
 
06:43:37.760 --> 06:43:38.708 align:start position:0%
the four
um

06:43:38.708 --> 06:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:38.718 --> 06:43:39.830 align:start position:0%
um
principles

06:43:39.830 --> 06:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
principles
 
06:43:40.868 --> 06:43:40.878 align:start position:0%
that were
 
06:43:43.030 --> 06:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
discussed in the statute and then those
 
06:43:44.310 --> 06:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
were then
 
06:43:46.868 --> 06:43:46.878 align:start position:0%
codified created in rulemaking and
 
06:43:49.190 --> 06:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
within each principle those four
 
06:43:50.628 --> 06:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
principles there's five actually in the
 
06:43:52.310 --> 06:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
code of conduct but the fifth is a duty
 
06:43:55.110 --> 06:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
to report but the four substantive
 
06:43:55.120 --> 06:43:57.030 align:start position:0%
to report but the four substantive
principles

06:43:57.030 --> 06:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
principles
 
06:44:00.070 --> 06:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
set out the the violations
 
06:44:00.080 --> 06:44:01.270 align:start position:0%
set out the the violations
um

06:44:01.270 --> 06:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:44:04.468 --> 06:44:04.478 align:start position:0%
tries to for us to be
 
06:44:07.590 --> 06:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
modifying the code of ethics through
 
06:44:11.990 --> 06:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
this venue or through uh rulemaking
 
06:44:14.548 --> 06:44:14.558 align:start position:0%
so to clarify you would be amending the
 
06:44:16.390 --> 06:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
code of conduct the code of ethics does
 
06:44:17.670 --> 06:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
not actually actually
 
06:44:21.350 --> 06:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
code of conduct i know i know you did um
 
06:44:21.360 --> 06:44:26.548 align:start position:0%
code of conduct i know i know you did um
so

06:44:26.548 --> 06:44:26.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:26.558 --> 06:44:28.310 align:start position:0%
 
ultimately

06:44:28.310 --> 06:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
06:44:30.150 --> 06:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
it is up to this committee but rule
 
06:44:32.788 --> 06:44:32.798 align:start position:0%
making is what created the document that
 
06:44:34.390 --> 06:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
you have in front of you
 
06:44:36.230 --> 06:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
and it is rule making that allowed the
 
06:44:37.990 --> 06:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
department if you think about what was
 
06:44:40.390 --> 06:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
passed by this committee
 
06:44:40.400 --> 06:44:44.030 align:start position:0%
passed by this committee
in

06:44:44.030 --> 06:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:47.110 --> 06:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
2016 or 2017
 
06:44:49.990 --> 06:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
it was four basic principles and in fact
 
06:44:51.110 --> 06:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
you were
 
06:44:52.390 --> 06:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
you were the sponsor of that
 
06:44:54.628 --> 06:44:54.638 align:start position:0%
representative lad and and you
 
06:44:56.708 --> 06:44:56.718 align:start position:0%
enumerated the four areas that you
 
06:44:59.750 --> 06:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
wanted the department to take action on
 
06:45:02.628 --> 06:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
and you gave us the blueprint
 
06:45:04.150 --> 06:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
and then the department took it via
 
06:45:06.070 --> 06:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
rulemaking which was in the statute
 
06:45:08.390 --> 06:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
obviously and
 
06:45:11.350 --> 06:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
elaborated upon those and we did so with
 
06:45:13.750 --> 06:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
our stakeholder partners
 
06:45:13.760 --> 06:45:14.708 align:start position:0%
our stakeholder partners
so

06:45:14.708 --> 06:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:45:16.788 --> 06:45:16.798 align:start position:0%
in keeping in that spirit that is
 
06:45:18.788 --> 06:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
certainly one way
 
06:45:20.948 --> 06:45:20.958 align:start position:0%
this legislative body could
 
06:45:23.910 --> 06:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
effectuate this intent in in
 
06:45:27.030 --> 06:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:32.830 --> 06:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:35.110 --> 06:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
rulemaking are there further questions
 
06:45:37.030 --> 06:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
represent tanner
 
06:45:39.510 --> 06:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you diane yes
 
06:45:39.520 --> 06:45:40.788 align:start position:0%
thank you diane yes
please

06:45:40.788 --> 06:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
please
 
06:45:40.798 --> 06:45:42.070 align:start position:0%
please
um

06:45:42.070 --> 06:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:44.070 --> 06:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
do you think that or
 
06:45:45.350 --> 06:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to put this as a
 
06:45:45.360 --> 06:45:47.430 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to put this as a
question

06:45:47.430 --> 06:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:45:49.110 --> 06:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
um do you
 
06:45:51.510 --> 06:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
think that the that any intent in the
 
06:45:53.110 --> 06:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
code of conduct
 
06:45:55.430 --> 06:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
was made to penalize a teacher for
 
06:45:57.110 --> 06:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
following the policies of the school
 
06:45:57.120 --> 06:45:59.350 align:start position:0%
following the policies of the school
district

06:45:59.350 --> 06:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
district
 
06:45:59.360 --> 06:46:00.070 align:start position:0%
district
so

06:46:00.070 --> 06:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:46:02.390 --> 06:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
when the code of conduct was created
 
06:46:02.400 --> 06:46:03.590 align:start position:0%
when the code of conduct was created
um

06:46:03.590 --> 06:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:05.750 --> 06:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
there was and there continues to be a
 
06:46:08.548 --> 06:46:08.558 align:start position:0%
very bright line between employment
 
06:46:10.548 --> 06:46:10.558 align:start position:0%
and licensure
 
06:46:10.558 --> 06:46:11.750 align:start position:0%
and licensure
and

06:46:11.750 --> 06:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:46:13.910 --> 06:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
that is the way the code of conduct has
 
06:46:15.350 --> 06:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
been interpreted and we have that
 
06:46:15.360 --> 06:46:16.390 align:start position:0%
been interpreted and we have that
discussion

06:46:16.390 --> 06:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
06:46:18.230 --> 06:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
on a consistent basis within the
 
06:46:20.548 --> 06:46:20.558 align:start position:0%
department of education there are
 
06:46:22.150 --> 06:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
actions that come before us for
 
06:46:24.628 --> 06:46:24.638 align:start position:0%
consideration which we deem to be
 
06:46:24.638 --> 06:46:25.750 align:start position:0%
consideration which we deem to be
employment

06:46:25.750 --> 06:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
employment
 
06:46:29.430 --> 06:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
so i will give you an example
 
06:46:29.440 --> 06:46:32.868 align:start position:0%
so i will give you an example
um

06:46:32.868 --> 06:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:35.670 --> 06:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
the department was contacted um with a
 
06:46:37.590 --> 06:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
concern that there was an educator an
 
06:46:40.948 --> 06:46:40.958 align:start position:0%
administrator who uh was not returning
 
06:46:40.958 --> 06:46:42.548 align:start position:0%
administrator who uh was not returning
um

06:46:42.548 --> 06:46:42.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:45.350 --> 06:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
their their phone call their their email
 
06:46:45.360 --> 06:46:46.070 align:start position:0%
their their phone call their their email
right

06:46:46.070 --> 06:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:46:46.080 --> 06:46:47.190 align:start position:0%
right
and

06:46:47.190 --> 06:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:46:49.670 --> 06:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
the parent was was upset and
 
06:46:51.350 --> 06:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
understandably so
 
06:46:54.310 --> 06:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
um and the parent requested that
 
06:46:56.628 --> 06:46:56.638 align:start position:0%
the department look at this matter um
 
06:46:58.788 --> 06:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
the facts were very clear
 
06:46:59.990 --> 06:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
and and
 
06:47:02.150 --> 06:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
wanted action to be taken on that
 
06:47:04.390 --> 06:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
person's credential and the decision was
 
06:47:06.628 --> 06:47:06.638 align:start position:0%
made that that's not the intent of the
 
06:47:07.990 --> 06:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
code of conduct
 
06:47:10.150 --> 06:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
um that was an employment issue
 
06:47:11.670 --> 06:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
the depart the district can deal with
 
06:47:14.070 --> 06:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
that however they see fit if they see
 
06:47:16.070 --> 06:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
that as a issue of professionalism they
 
06:47:17.830 --> 06:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
can deal with that that's not a
 
06:47:19.750 --> 06:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
credentialing issue
 
06:47:22.468 --> 06:47:22.478 align:start position:0%
um when the code of conduct was created
 
06:47:24.070 --> 06:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
it was created
 
06:47:26.070 --> 06:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
as a recognition of the importance of
 
06:47:28.390 --> 06:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
child safety period
 
06:47:31.590 --> 06:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
that's it and we recognize that
 
06:47:33.670 --> 06:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
if departments deal with educators who
 
06:47:35.590 --> 06:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
should not be around children
 
06:47:37.830 --> 06:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
exclusively as a matter of employment
 
06:47:40.468 --> 06:47:40.478 align:start position:0%
then those educators will go from
 
06:47:42.868 --> 06:47:42.878 align:start position:0%
district to district to district and
 
06:47:44.868 --> 06:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
that is what the code of conduct was
 
06:47:47.350 --> 06:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
intended to prohibit and that is in
 
06:47:49.270 --> 06:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
large part how the code of conduct has
 
06:47:50.548 --> 06:47:50.558 align:start position:0%
been and will be
 
06:47:52.230 --> 06:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
interpreted we are held to our
 
06:47:53.830 --> 06:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
precedence of how we interpret that
 
06:47:55.830 --> 06:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
moving forward and so yes
 
06:47:57.430 --> 06:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the question because we
 
06:48:00.070 --> 06:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
always go back to that delineating line
 
06:48:02.628 --> 06:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
is this employment or is this licensure
 
06:48:04.390 --> 06:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
another example briefly that i will give
 
06:48:06.070 --> 06:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
you because i know we're getting to be
 
06:48:08.310 --> 06:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
near four o'clock um we had a gentleman
 
06:48:08.320 --> 06:48:09.110 align:start position:0%
near four o'clock um we had a gentleman
who

06:48:09.110 --> 06:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
who
 
06:48:11.910 --> 06:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh was accused of of
 
06:48:14.390 --> 06:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
misappropriating um
 
06:48:16.150 --> 06:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
those hvac
 
06:48:17.670 --> 06:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
like this big
 
06:48:19.030 --> 06:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
whatever those are called those air
 
06:48:21.030 --> 06:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
filters in the back of the room shows my
 
06:48:24.230 --> 06:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
knowledge base um he
 
06:48:26.628 --> 06:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
took that from the school allegedly he
 
06:48:28.390 --> 06:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
took it from the school and brought it
 
06:48:29.510 --> 06:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
home and
 
06:48:31.430 --> 06:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
kept it for a while and brought it back
 
06:48:33.430 --> 06:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
and the district handled that the
 
06:48:35.510 --> 06:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
district imposed whatever they thought
 
06:48:37.350 --> 06:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
was appropriate the department reviewed
 
06:48:40.868 --> 06:48:40.878 align:start position:0%
it we made a determination
 
06:48:43.590 --> 06:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
that that's not that's that's employment
 
06:48:46.390 --> 06:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
it's employment it's not going to uh
 
06:48:48.868 --> 06:48:48.878 align:start position:0%
affect the license and so we always keep
 
06:48:50.788 --> 06:48:50.798 align:start position:0%
that in mind and that's a long answer to
 
06:48:52.310 --> 06:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
a short question
 
06:48:54.708 --> 06:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
yes there will always be a line i always
 
06:48:57.270 --> 06:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
use myself as an example
 
06:48:59.430 --> 06:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
i'm a licensed attorney
 
06:49:00.788 --> 06:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
but i'm employed by the state of new
 
06:49:02.230 --> 06:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire in the department of education
 
06:49:05.110 --> 06:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
and there are things that i do that that
 
06:49:07.590 --> 06:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
could affect my employment
 
06:49:09.670 --> 06:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
right there are things that i do testify
 
06:49:12.150 --> 06:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
to um i can tell you my computer which
 
06:49:14.230 --> 06:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
is state property
 
06:49:16.390 --> 06:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
has a beautiful picture of my child when
 
06:49:19.350 --> 06:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
you pop it up super cute it's adorable
 
06:49:21.830 --> 06:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it violates an i.t policy
 
06:49:24.468 --> 06:49:24.478 align:start position:0%
right but he's super cute so it's okay
 
06:49:26.230 --> 06:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
and this is being recorded
 
06:49:26.240 --> 06:49:29.350 align:start position:0%
and this is being recorded
so

06:49:29.350 --> 06:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:30.788 --> 06:49:30.798 align:start position:0%
i played the fifth
 
06:49:30.798 --> 06:49:31.590 align:start position:0%
i played the fifth
um

06:49:31.590 --> 06:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:33.830 --> 06:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
but right could that be an issue
 
06:49:36.230 --> 06:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
employment wise yes if i violate a dress
 
06:49:38.230 --> 06:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
code policy yes if i don't show up to
 
06:49:40.310 --> 06:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
work yes if
 
06:49:41.830 --> 06:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
right commissioner edible can probably
 
06:49:44.230 --> 06:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
find a whole host of things um
 
06:49:46.150 --> 06:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
employment employment employment but it
 
06:49:48.788 --> 06:49:48.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily equal a violation of
 
06:49:52.868 --> 06:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
my license to practice law
 
06:49:55.030 --> 06:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
if however i was submitting false travel
 
06:49:57.270 --> 06:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
to say oh yes i went to
 
06:49:59.030 --> 06:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
a training in portsmouth today rather
 
06:50:01.030 --> 06:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
than here in concord and here is my
 
06:50:02.708 --> 06:50:02.718 align:start position:0%
travel state of new hampshire please
 
06:50:05.270 --> 06:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
reimburse me that's theft
 
06:50:06.948 --> 06:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
and that would be reportable to the new
 
06:50:08.868 --> 06:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire bar and could take action on
 
06:50:11.510 --> 06:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
my license and so that is the framework
 
06:50:13.510 --> 06:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
or a work policy is going to rise to
 
06:50:15.030 --> 06:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
that level to say
 
06:50:19.670 --> 06:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:22.868 --> 06:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that answer
 
06:50:24.788 --> 06:50:24.798 align:start position:0%
more than you more than you bargained
 
06:50:27.750 --> 06:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
for no i think it puts it out i would
 
06:50:31.350 --> 06:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
also ask do you think that
 
06:50:34.150 --> 06:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
using somebody's credential
 
06:50:36.070 --> 06:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
their ability to
 
06:50:36.080 --> 06:50:37.030 align:start position:0%
their ability to
um

06:50:37.030 --> 06:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:39.670 --> 06:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
use their degree and their expertise and
 
06:50:39.680 --> 06:50:40.468 align:start position:0%
use their degree and their expertise and
their

06:50:40.468 --> 06:50:40.478 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:50:43.270 --> 06:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
livelihood to take that away
 
06:50:43.280 --> 06:50:44.310 align:start position:0%
livelihood to take that away
um

06:50:44.310 --> 06:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:44.320 --> 06:50:45.430 align:start position:0%
um
is

06:50:45.430 --> 06:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:50:48.390 --> 06:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
is a a strong weapon
 
06:50:50.628 --> 06:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be used only in
 
06:50:50.638 --> 06:50:51.350 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be used only in
in

06:50:51.350 --> 06:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:50:53.750 --> 06:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
really extreme cases that are like you
 
06:50:57.990 --> 06:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
said um theft uh you know child abuse uh
 
06:51:00.150 --> 06:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
you've you've outlined some in the code
 
06:51:02.468 --> 06:51:02.478 align:start position:0%
of conduct and that
 
06:51:04.468 --> 06:51:04.478 align:start position:0%
simply following uh the school
 
06:51:06.948 --> 06:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
district's mask policy if their mass
 
06:51:10.868 --> 06:51:10.878 align:start position:0%
policy happens to be under um
 
06:51:12.150 --> 06:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
discussion or
 
06:51:15.190 --> 06:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
diversion or whatever by the the public
 
06:51:17.670 --> 06:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
or by the you know uh
 
06:51:19.910 --> 06:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
brought to the attention that that's the
 
06:51:19.920 --> 06:51:21.030 align:start position:0%
brought to the attention that that's the
district

06:51:21.030 --> 06:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
district
 
06:51:22.788 --> 06:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
and that the teacher is simply following
 
06:51:25.190 --> 06:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
that policy that that isn't something to
 
06:51:28.390 --> 06:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
weaponize their credential against
 
06:51:28.400 --> 06:51:29.110 align:start position:0%
weaponize their credential against
i

06:51:29.110 --> 06:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:51:30.948 --> 06:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
i think that's that is a policy
 
06:51:33.510 --> 06:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
consideration for this legislative body
 
06:51:33.520 --> 06:51:38.070 align:start position:0%
consideration for this legislative body
and

06:51:38.070 --> 06:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:39.590 --> 06:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
and i will hesitate to go beyond that
 
06:51:42.548 --> 06:51:42.558 align:start position:0%
line but what i can tell you is again
 
06:51:44.230 --> 06:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct was created for a
 
06:51:45.830 --> 06:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
certain purpose and it was created out
 
06:51:47.990 --> 06:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
of recognition um
 
06:51:50.628 --> 06:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
that there are some high-level issues
 
06:51:52.628 --> 06:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
that the state agency has to become
 
06:51:54.310 --> 06:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
06:51:56.868 --> 06:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
and we recognize that there is a
 
06:51:58.628 --> 06:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
difference between employment and
 
06:52:01.910 --> 06:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
licensure there simply is and i always
 
06:52:04.070 --> 06:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
use myself as an example which one of
 
06:52:05.430 --> 06:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
these days is going to get me in trouble
 
06:52:07.510 --> 06:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
and today might be that day
 
06:52:07.520 --> 06:52:08.948 align:start position:0%
and today might be that day
um

06:52:08.948 --> 06:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:52:10.708 --> 06:52:10.718 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:52:13.190 --> 06:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
if i were to be fired
 
06:52:15.910 --> 06:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
that's one thing right but i go and i
 
06:52:18.708 --> 06:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
work as a lawyer in another capacity
 
06:52:20.468 --> 06:52:20.478 align:start position:0%
maybe i hang out my shingle maybe i go
 
06:52:22.070 --> 06:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
work for morgan and morgan who knows
 
06:52:24.150 --> 06:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
there's a whole host of things i can do
 
06:52:24.160 --> 06:52:26.150 align:start position:0%
there's a whole host of things i can do
um

06:52:26.150 --> 06:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:52:28.788 --> 06:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
i can still function in that role as an
 
06:52:28.798 --> 06:52:29.830 align:start position:0%
i can still function in that role as an
attorney

06:52:29.830 --> 06:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
06:52:29.840 --> 06:52:30.708 align:start position:0%
attorney
if

06:52:30.708 --> 06:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:52:32.788 --> 06:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
i lose my license
 
06:52:35.590 --> 06:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
to practice law that is a very different
 
06:52:35.600 --> 06:52:39.350 align:start position:0%
to practice law that is a very different
analysis

06:52:39.350 --> 06:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:39.360 --> 06:52:40.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:52:40.310 --> 06:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:52:42.868 --> 06:52:42.878 align:start position:0%
again we carry that same idea over and
 
06:52:45.430 --> 06:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
and all agencies that regulate licenses
 
06:52:48.788 --> 06:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
have that same basic analysis and if you
 
06:52:53.830 --> 06:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:55.430 --> 06:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:52:55.440 --> 06:52:56.310 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

06:52:56.310 --> 06:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:52:58.788 --> 06:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
dianne if a school board enacts this
 
06:52:58.798 --> 06:53:01.430 align:start position:0%
dianne if a school board enacts this
policy

06:53:01.430 --> 06:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:05.350 --> 06:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
and if i'm a teacher in the classroom
 
06:53:07.830 --> 06:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
and i want to keep my job
 
06:53:12.628 --> 06:53:12.638 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to also enforce that policy
 
06:53:12.638 --> 06:53:13.510 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to also enforce that policy
um

06:53:13.510 --> 06:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:13.520 --> 06:53:15.990 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:53:15.990 --> 06:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:53:18.468 --> 06:53:18.478 align:start position:0%
the teacher is the one that's caught
 
06:53:19.830 --> 06:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
saying you know
 
06:53:21.670 --> 06:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
and and going to be reprimanded because
 
06:53:23.110 --> 06:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
they're the one with the ticket with the
 
06:53:23.120 --> 06:53:26.070 align:start position:0%
they're the one with the ticket with the
certification

06:53:26.070 --> 06:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:26.080 --> 06:53:26.788 align:start position:0%
 
but

06:53:26.788 --> 06:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:53:26.798 --> 06:53:28.708 align:start position:0%
but
um

06:53:28.708 --> 06:53:28.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:31.350 --> 06:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
is the the teacher didn't instigate the
 
06:53:31.360 --> 06:53:32.468 align:start position:0%
is the the teacher didn't instigate the
policy

06:53:32.468 --> 06:53:32.478 align:start position:0%
policy
 
06:53:34.708 --> 06:53:34.718 align:start position:0%
the teacher was doing what he or she has
 
06:53:37.110 --> 06:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
just been told to do by
 
06:53:38.310 --> 06:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
the boss
 
06:53:38.320 --> 06:53:39.990 align:start position:0%
the boss
so

06:53:39.990 --> 06:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:53:42.230 --> 06:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
can in fact in a situation like this how
 
06:53:43.590 --> 06:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
would this code
 
06:53:46.788 --> 06:53:46.798 align:start position:0%
can the code of a conduct be
 
06:53:46.798 --> 06:53:47.910 align:start position:0%
can the code of a conduct be
used

06:53:47.910 --> 06:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
used
 
06:53:50.868 --> 06:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
against that teacher for something one
 
06:53:52.708 --> 06:53:52.718 align:start position:0%
hand you you damned if you do and damned
 
06:53:54.310 --> 06:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
if you don't that's the situation the
 
06:53:56.708 --> 06:53:56.718 align:start position:0%
person's in
 
06:54:09.110 --> 06:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:10.868 --> 06:54:10.878 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't know
 
06:54:13.350 --> 06:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
um i mean
 
06:54:15.590 --> 06:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
again i i would encourage this body to
 
06:54:16.788 --> 06:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
recognize the difference between
 
06:54:18.628 --> 06:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
employment and licensure and all i can
 
06:54:21.670 --> 06:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
tell you is that um
 
06:54:23.750 --> 06:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
that that's the design and the
 
06:54:25.510 --> 06:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
underpinnings of the code of conduct and
 
06:54:26.390 --> 06:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
i think
 
06:54:28.548 --> 06:54:28.558 align:start position:0%
throughout this pandemic the department
 
06:54:31.910 --> 06:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
has received numerous complaints on
 
06:54:34.868 --> 06:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
masks no masks all these different
 
06:54:37.990 --> 06:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
policies and how they were handled at
 
06:54:40.628 --> 06:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
the local level we have gotten an
 
06:54:43.030 --> 06:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
enormous number of calls on this as
 
06:54:46.310 --> 06:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
this legislative body can only imagine
 
06:54:49.830 --> 06:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
and the department has consistently said
 
06:54:52.150 --> 06:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
that's a school board policy decision
 
06:54:54.628 --> 06:54:54.638 align:start position:0%
and the superintendent or the teacher or
 
06:54:56.868 --> 06:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
the administrator was simply following
 
06:54:59.350 --> 06:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
the policy
 
06:55:01.190 --> 06:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
and and it
 
06:55:03.350 --> 06:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
there was no action for the department
 
06:55:04.548 --> 06:55:04.558 align:start position:0%
to take
 
06:55:04.558 --> 06:55:06.868 align:start position:0%
to take
um

06:55:06.868 --> 06:55:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:09.190 --> 06:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
if this legislative body wants to to
 
06:55:11.990 --> 06:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
change that then i would suggest we that
 
06:55:13.990 --> 06:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
it go into rule making so that it can
 
06:55:14.000 --> 06:55:14.948 align:start position:0%
it go into rule making so that it can
mirror

06:55:14.948 --> 06:55:14.958 align:start position:0%
mirror
 
06:55:14.958 --> 06:55:16.468 align:start position:0%
mirror
um

06:55:16.468 --> 06:55:16.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:55:18.548 --> 06:55:18.558 align:start position:0%
what was done with the code of conduct
 
06:55:20.070 --> 06:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli
 
06:55:22.948 --> 06:55:22.958 align:start position:0%
representative mullen thank you um
 
06:55:25.430 --> 06:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
but it's not just a matter of
 
06:55:28.948 --> 06:55:28.958 align:start position:0%
if a teacher is following the policy
 
06:55:31.110 --> 06:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
it's if they're not following the policy
 
06:55:31.120 --> 06:55:32.150 align:start position:0%
it's if they're not following the policy
also

06:55:32.150 --> 06:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
also
 
06:55:35.270 --> 06:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
is one and secondly um
 
06:55:37.830 --> 06:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of a complaint to the
 
06:55:40.948 --> 06:55:40.958 align:start position:0%
department under the code of conduct um
 
06:55:43.030 --> 06:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
there are other uh
 
06:55:45.670 --> 06:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
actions that can be taken other than uh
 
06:55:48.230 --> 06:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
pulling a license is that correct oh
 
06:55:50.628 --> 06:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
that is absolutely correct yes uh and
 
06:55:52.548 --> 06:55:52.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for that we have three forms
 
06:55:52.558 --> 06:55:53.350 align:start position:0%
thank you for that we have three forms
of

06:55:53.350 --> 06:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:55:56.310 --> 06:55:56.320 align:start position:0%
um of of sanction uh i always say
 
06:55:57.830 --> 06:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
there's four actions and three forms of
 
06:56:00.150 --> 06:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
sanction so the first action is we close
 
06:56:01.830 --> 06:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
out the case no action taken and we do
 
06:56:05.350 --> 06:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
that um the allegations unfounded or
 
06:56:08.070 --> 06:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
unsubstantiated what have you
 
06:56:10.948 --> 06:56:10.958 align:start position:0%
a revocation is reserved in large part
 
06:56:10.958 --> 06:56:11.750 align:start position:0%
a revocation is reserved in large part
for

06:56:11.750 --> 06:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:56:13.270 --> 06:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
individuals who are having inappropriate
 
06:56:15.030 --> 06:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
sexual relationships with students we've
 
06:56:16.390 --> 06:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
seen that in the in the news you've
 
06:56:17.750 --> 06:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
heard of those
 
06:56:19.750 --> 06:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
and that is a permanent removal of that
 
06:56:22.390 --> 06:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
person's license a suspension is a set
 
06:56:24.150 --> 06:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
period of time in which that person is
 
06:56:26.150 --> 06:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
removed from the classroom
 
06:56:27.830 --> 06:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
and then there is a reprimand the
 
06:56:30.070 --> 06:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
reprimand is a written warning it's
 
06:56:31.430 --> 06:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
simply between the department and the
 
06:56:34.230 --> 06:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
individual and there's and the license
 
06:56:36.390 --> 06:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
the credential remains valid
 
06:56:36.400 --> 06:56:37.830 align:start position:0%
the credential remains valid
um

06:56:37.830 --> 06:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:56:39.830 --> 06:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
and so we we think of reprimands i think
 
06:56:41.270 --> 06:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
of them as kind of the rumble strip on
 
06:56:43.990 --> 06:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
the highway right just kind of leads you
 
06:56:47.030 --> 06:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
guides you back into your lane but the
 
06:56:49.110 --> 06:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
credential remains valid yes
 
06:56:52.468 --> 06:56:52.478 align:start position:0%
we we have that ability
 
06:56:54.468 --> 06:56:54.478 align:start position:0%
representative mullin thank you mr chair
 
06:56:55.990 --> 06:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you attorney finn for taking
 
06:56:57.270 --> 06:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
my question
 
06:56:59.670 --> 06:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
so i guess
 
06:56:59.680 --> 06:57:00.548 align:start position:0%
so i guess
my

06:57:00.548 --> 06:57:00.558 align:start position:0%
my
 
06:57:02.788 --> 06:57:02.798 align:start position:0%
follow-up question to that
 
06:57:04.788 --> 06:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
bit of information that you just shared
 
06:57:08.310 --> 06:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
is that when the department determines
 
06:57:10.628 --> 06:57:10.638 align:start position:0%
whether it's a reprimand or a revocation
 
06:57:13.270 --> 06:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
or a suspension or whatever
 
06:57:15.910 --> 06:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
is that considered a disciplinary
 
06:57:19.750 --> 06:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
sanction by the state board of education
 
06:57:19.760 --> 06:57:21.110 align:start position:0%
sanction by the state board of education
and

06:57:21.110 --> 06:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:57:24.150 --> 06:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
if not then what is the significance of
 
06:57:25.590 --> 06:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
the language
 
06:57:28.468 --> 06:57:28.478 align:start position:0%
justifies disciplinary sanction by the
 
06:57:31.270 --> 06:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
state board of education
 
06:57:33.430 --> 06:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
so representative mullen looking at this
 
06:57:33.440 --> 06:57:36.468 align:start position:0%
so representative mullen looking at this
language

06:57:36.468 --> 06:57:36.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:38.788 --> 06:57:38.798 align:start position:0%
i interpret this language to mean
 
06:57:40.628 --> 06:57:40.638 align:start position:0%
action taken under the code of conduct
 
06:57:43.030 --> 06:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
by by the department
 
06:57:45.110 --> 06:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
the state board of education
 
06:57:46.070 --> 06:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
is the
 
06:57:47.990 --> 06:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
global entity if you will that issues
 
06:57:49.510 --> 06:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
the credential
 
06:57:52.390 --> 06:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
the department is acting on behalf of
 
06:57:53.990 --> 06:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
the state board of education and we've
 
06:57:56.548 --> 06:57:56.558 align:start position:0%
had that discussion and other scenarios
 
06:57:58.468 --> 06:57:58.478 align:start position:0%
and other contacts that we act on the
 
06:58:00.150 --> 06:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
department acts on behalf of the state
 
06:58:01.750 --> 06:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
board and so
 
06:58:03.590 --> 06:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
it is the state board of education that
 
06:58:06.708 --> 06:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
we kind of oversee all of that and when
 
06:58:09.270 --> 06:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
that comes into play
 
06:58:11.670 --> 06:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
we had a case
 
06:58:13.750 --> 06:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
in which the educator
 
06:58:13.760 --> 06:58:15.270 align:start position:0%
in which the educator
um

06:58:15.270 --> 06:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:58:17.350 --> 06:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
challenged the department's findings
 
06:58:19.910 --> 06:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
challenged the offer of the discipline
 
06:58:21.590 --> 06:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
and went to a hearing and then
 
06:58:23.590 --> 06:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
challenged that finding to the state
 
06:58:25.030 --> 06:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
board of education and so the state
 
06:58:26.948 --> 06:58:26.958 align:start position:0%
board had the final say and that's
 
06:58:28.868 --> 06:58:28.878 align:start position:0%
that's our process that is due process
 
06:58:31.670 --> 06:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
that is how we build it in um but when i
 
06:58:33.350 --> 06:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
read this
 
06:58:35.430 --> 06:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
to me my interpretation falls right into
 
06:58:38.390 --> 06:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
the the code of conduct yes other
 
06:58:40.708 --> 06:58:40.718 align:start position:0%
further representative
 
06:58:42.788 --> 06:58:42.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair um and
 
06:58:44.548 --> 06:58:44.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much miss and for
 
06:58:47.350 --> 06:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
sticking with us this afternoon so um
 
06:58:48.708 --> 06:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
question i've got sort of goes back to
 
06:58:50.390 --> 06:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
what representative tanner was asking
 
06:58:52.788 --> 06:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
about earlier which is
 
06:58:55.670 --> 06:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
the the section of law that that this
 
06:58:55.680 --> 06:58:56.628 align:start position:0%
the the section of law that that this
bill

06:58:56.628 --> 06:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:58:56.638 --> 06:58:57.910 align:start position:0%
bill
amends

06:58:57.910 --> 06:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
amends
 
06:59:00.628 --> 06:59:00.638 align:start position:0%
which is 189.10 and i was wondering does
 
06:59:02.310 --> 06:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
the department actually have rulemaking
 
06:59:02.320 --> 06:59:03.350 align:start position:0%
the department actually have rulemaking
authority

06:59:03.350 --> 06:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
authority
 
06:59:22.948 --> 06:59:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:25.350 --> 06:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
so representative luna based on my
 
06:59:27.590 --> 06:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
quick look at 189.10
 
06:59:29.030 --> 06:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
in this section
 
06:59:29.040 --> 06:59:30.548 align:start position:0%
in this section
i

06:59:30.548 --> 06:59:30.558 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:59:34.628 --> 06:59:34.638 align:start position:0%
i do not see a reference to 189
 
06:59:34.638 --> 06:59:35.350 align:start position:0%
i do not see a reference to 189
or

06:59:35.350 --> 06:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:59:37.750 --> 06:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
strike that i do not see the statutory
 
06:59:40.708 --> 06:59:40.718 align:start position:0%
reference to rsa 541a which is the
 
06:59:42.708 --> 06:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority right and when we
 
06:59:44.708 --> 06:59:44.718 align:start position:0%
look at rulemaking authority it has to
 
06:59:47.510 --> 06:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
be explicitly stated in the statute
 
06:59:51.750 --> 06:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
and it is helpful if it also says
 
06:59:53.670 --> 06:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
what the parameters of that rulemaking
 
06:59:56.390 --> 06:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
authority are and we saw that
 
06:59:58.468 --> 06:59:58.478 align:start position:0%
with career and technical education we
 
07:00:00.310 --> 07:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
went back and looked at our rules and i
 
07:00:02.390 --> 07:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
know that's not relevant to this
 
07:00:04.948 --> 07:00:04.958 align:start position:0%
conversation but i don't see it in
 
07:00:07.910 --> 07:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
188910 and i don't see that reference in
 
07:00:10.310 --> 07:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
1 89 10
 
07:00:10.320 --> 07:00:11.750 align:start position:0%
1 89 10
a

07:00:11.750 --> 07:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
07:00:12.868 --> 07:00:12.878 align:start position:0%
but i
 
07:00:15.350 --> 07:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
if i missed it i apologize but
 
07:00:17.110 --> 07:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
to the best of my knowledge i just don't
 
07:00:19.510 --> 07:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
see that okay and a follow-up on that
 
07:00:23.510 --> 07:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
and so so based on um
 
07:00:25.750 --> 07:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
based on
 
07:00:27.190 --> 07:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
ed rules
 
07:00:29.510 --> 07:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
and i think i'm looking in 5 11
 
07:00:31.750 --> 07:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere which is the
 
07:00:34.070 --> 07:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
code the the rules for for the code of
 
07:00:34.080 --> 07:00:35.430 align:start position:0%
code the the rules for for the code of
conduct

07:00:35.430 --> 07:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
07:00:35.440 --> 07:00:37.030 align:start position:0%
conduct
it

07:00:37.030 --> 07:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:00:38.468 --> 07:00:38.478 align:start position:0%
it says the following shall be
 
07:00:38.478 --> 07:00:40.628 align:start position:0%
it says the following shall be
considered

07:00:40.628 --> 07:00:40.638 align:start position:0%
considered
 
07:00:43.590 --> 07:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
aggravating circumstances
 
07:00:43.600 --> 07:00:44.868 align:start position:0%
aggravating circumstances
um

07:00:44.868 --> 07:00:44.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:00:47.110 --> 07:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
and seriousness offense the credential
 
07:00:49.510 --> 07:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
holder's prior disciplinary record
 
07:00:49.520 --> 07:00:50.390 align:start position:0%
holder's prior disciplinary record
um

07:00:50.390 --> 07:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:00:53.190 --> 07:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh the the credential holders lack of
 
07:00:55.590 --> 07:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
willingness to cooperate the potential
 
07:00:58.310 --> 07:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
harm to public health and safety and the
 
07:01:01.510 --> 07:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
purpose of the rule violated so so if in
 
07:01:04.070 --> 07:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
fact the the code of conduct is there's
 
07:01:06.150 --> 07:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
going to be considered to be a violation
 
07:01:08.230 --> 07:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
it would have to be in rules
 
07:01:11.270 --> 07:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
and and for this
 
07:01:13.750 --> 07:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
um for this section
 
07:01:15.110 --> 07:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
to be
 
07:01:17.190 --> 07:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
relative connected to rules there would
 
07:01:19.110 --> 07:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
have to be rule making authority does
 
07:01:19.120 --> 07:01:19.830 align:start position:0%
have to be rule making authority does
that

07:01:19.830 --> 07:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:01:30.230 --> 07:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:32.390 --> 07:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
would there be a connection if
 
07:01:34.468 --> 07:01:34.478 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the terminology code
 
07:01:36.150 --> 07:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
of ethics which is in this bill would
 
07:01:40.628 --> 07:01:40.638 align:start position:0%
that verbitch relate it back to 21n
 
07:01:43.110 --> 07:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
which is has 541 within
 
07:01:45.830 --> 07:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
but doesn't reference 189
 
07:01:48.070 --> 07:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
other sections 189 do have rule making
 
07:01:48.080 --> 07:01:51.190 align:start position:0%
other sections 189 do have rule making
authority

07:01:51.190 --> 07:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:51.200 --> 07:01:51.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:01:51.910 --> 07:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:01:54.708 --> 07:01:54.718 align:start position:0%
looking at at section three because it
 
07:01:57.350 --> 07:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
references the educator code of conduct
 
07:01:59.510 --> 07:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
i would certainly argue that the 511s
 
07:02:01.750 --> 07:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules 511 that talks
 
07:02:03.910 --> 07:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
about our policy
 
07:02:05.910 --> 07:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
that we follow
 
07:02:07.910 --> 07:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
when we administer the the code of
 
07:02:09.910 --> 07:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
conduct so i i would certainly argue
 
07:02:12.788 --> 07:02:12.798 align:start position:0%
that the 511s are are applicable because
 
07:02:14.628 --> 07:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
this references the educator code of
 
07:02:14.638 --> 07:02:17.910 align:start position:0%
this references the educator code of
conduct

07:02:17.910 --> 07:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:19.510 --> 07:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
are there further questions of the
 
07:02:21.350 --> 07:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
department represent tanner yeah i have
 
07:02:24.468 --> 07:02:24.478 align:start position:0%
just one more here so if i take this
 
07:02:24.478 --> 07:02:25.510 align:start position:0%
just one more here so if i take this
bill

07:02:25.510 --> 07:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:02:26.868 --> 07:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
and i kind of
 
07:02:30.868 --> 07:02:30.878 align:start position:0%
chop it down to its skeletal area as as
 
07:02:32.390 --> 07:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
it looks to this
 
07:02:34.150 --> 07:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
section three
 
07:02:36.708 --> 07:02:36.718 align:start position:0%
um the first part is that the meat of
 
07:02:39.350 --> 07:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
the bill is that that nobody in this
 
07:02:39.360 --> 07:02:40.548 align:start position:0%
the bill is that that nobody in this
listing

07:02:40.548 --> 07:02:40.558 align:start position:0%
listing
 
07:02:42.868 --> 07:02:42.878 align:start position:0%
shall adapt and force or implement a
 
07:02:45.830 --> 07:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
policy that requires basically mass of
 
07:02:47.750 --> 07:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
students and and other people that's the
 
07:02:50.230 --> 07:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
meat of the top one
 
07:02:52.708 --> 07:02:52.718 align:start position:0%
down in section three it says violation
 
07:02:56.230 --> 07:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
of this section so um by an educator
 
07:02:59.270 --> 07:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
shall be considered a violation of the
 
07:03:01.510 --> 07:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
educator's code of conduct so it's
 
07:03:03.270 --> 07:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
saying if i
 
07:03:05.990 --> 07:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
enforce or implement a policy
 
07:03:08.230 --> 07:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
that my school board has it
 
07:03:10.230 --> 07:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
under this bill
 
07:03:12.310 --> 07:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
it becomes a violation of the code of
 
07:03:13.910 --> 07:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
conduct it's rewriting the code of
 
07:03:16.150 --> 07:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
conduct and putting that specific
 
07:03:18.150 --> 07:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
violation in there is that how you would
 
07:03:20.390 --> 07:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
read this bill
 
07:03:24.468 --> 07:03:24.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:27.430 --> 07:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
further discussion with
 
07:03:27.440 --> 07:03:31.190 align:start position:0%
further discussion with
representatives

07:03:31.190 --> 07:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:34.868 --> 07:03:34.878 align:start position:0%
so when it says educator
 
07:03:37.990 --> 07:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
that includes the administrators right
 
07:03:39.510 --> 07:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
that is how we have interpreted the code
 
07:03:40.868 --> 07:03:40.878 align:start position:0%
of conduct yes
 
07:03:40.878 --> 07:03:41.990 align:start position:0%
of conduct yes
so

07:03:41.990 --> 07:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:03:45.190 --> 07:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
if a school board
 
07:03:47.750 --> 07:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
followed this law and did not implement
 
07:03:47.760 --> 07:03:49.270 align:start position:0%
followed this law and did not implement
masks

07:03:49.270 --> 07:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
masks
 
07:03:50.868 --> 07:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
and a
 
07:03:50.878 --> 07:03:53.270 align:start position:0%
and a
principal

07:03:53.270 --> 07:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
principal
 
07:03:55.670 --> 07:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
decided that in my school or the
 
07:03:59.030 --> 07:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
superintendent decided in all my schools
 
07:04:02.468 --> 07:04:02.478 align:start position:0%
we are going to have masks
 
07:04:04.390 --> 07:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
how would that
 
07:04:06.070 --> 07:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
07:04:08.948 --> 07:04:08.958 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be as an educator
 
07:04:08.958 --> 07:04:09.990 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be as an educator
and

07:04:09.990 --> 07:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:04:12.150 --> 07:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
the violation would be because they
 
07:04:14.948 --> 07:04:14.958 align:start position:0%
didn't follow the school board and
 
07:04:18.150 --> 07:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
didn't follow the law this law right i
 
07:04:20.070 --> 07:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
how would that work
 
07:04:22.390 --> 07:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
so based on that hypothetical
 
07:04:22.400 --> 07:04:23.750 align:start position:0%
so based on that hypothetical
um

07:04:23.750 --> 07:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:04:23.760 --> 07:04:24.548 align:start position:0%
um
then

07:04:24.548 --> 07:04:24.558 align:start position:0%
then
 
07:04:24.558 --> 07:04:26.070 align:start position:0%
then
yes

07:04:26.070 --> 07:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:04:28.070 --> 07:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
i mean again based on that hypothetical
 
07:04:30.230 --> 07:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
the department could in theory take
 
07:04:31.830 --> 07:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
action upon the
 
07:04:31.840 --> 07:04:33.430 align:start position:0%
action upon the
superintendent's

07:04:33.430 --> 07:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
superintendent's
 
07:04:35.510 --> 07:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
credential yes the code of conduct was
 
07:04:37.590 --> 07:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
rent written and intended to be
 
07:04:39.430 --> 07:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
applicable to both educators and
 
07:04:42.150 --> 07:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
administrators and our actions have
 
07:04:44.310 --> 07:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
supported that interpretation yes thank
 
07:04:44.320 --> 07:04:48.150 align:start position:0%
supported that interpretation yes thank
you

07:04:48.150 --> 07:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:50.788 --> 07:04:50.798 align:start position:0%
further discussion or the
 
07:04:50.798 --> 07:04:53.110 align:start position:0%
further discussion or the
department

07:04:53.110 --> 07:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
department
 
07:04:54.548 --> 07:04:54.558 align:start position:0%
but then i'm going to just take a five
 
07:04:56.868 --> 07:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
minute break here ten minute break and
 
07:04:59.030 --> 07:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
come back i think some of us have to get
 
07:04:59.040 --> 07:05:00.708 align:start position:0%
come back i think some of us have to get
up

07:05:00.708 --> 07:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
up
 
07:05:02.468 --> 07:05:02.478 align:start position:0%
we'll come back
 
07:05:04.390 --> 07:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
there may be a horrible flower mark
 
07:05:04.400 --> 07:05:23.270 align:start position:0%
there may be a horrible flower mark
downstairs

07:05:23.270 --> 07:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:28.548 --> 07:19:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:43.430 --> 07:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:51.190 --> 07:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:53.350 --> 07:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
for purposes of moving i'd like to have
 
07:19:55.030 --> 07:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli make a motion
 
07:19:55.040 --> 07:19:58.230 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli make a motion
please

yes

07:20:01.990 --> 07:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:08.788 --> 07:20:08.798 align:start position:0%

07:20:18.798 --> 07:20:20.030 align:start position:0%
 
0

07:20:20.030 --> 07:20:20.040 align:start position:0%

07:20:27.670 --> 07:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
07:20:31.750 --> 07:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:32.830 --> 07:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
is there
 
07:20:36.948 --> 07:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
a discussion from the make of the motion
 
07:20:38.868 --> 07:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
um i think we've had quite a bit of
 
07:20:44.788 --> 07:20:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:46.388 --> 07:20:46.398 align:start position:0%

you don't want to talk it's your
opportunity

07:20:53.430 --> 07:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:57.350 --> 07:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
okay no is there further discussion
 
07:20:57.360 --> 07:20:58.230 align:start position:0%
okay no is there further discussion
yes

07:20:58.230 --> 07:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:21:01.830 --> 07:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
um thanks very much so um
 
07:21:04.070 --> 07:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that that in the
 
07:21:07.030 --> 07:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
last few days the uh the department has
 
07:21:07.040 --> 07:21:07.830 align:start position:0%
last few days the uh the department has
um

07:21:07.830 --> 07:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:21:11.270 --> 07:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
has um uh told uh school boards or
 
07:21:13.590 --> 07:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
through their superintendents that uh
 
07:21:15.670 --> 07:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
that know that schools cannot have any
 
07:21:17.750 --> 07:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
um are prohibited from any mask
 
07:21:19.670 --> 07:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
requirements and i'm wondering if we
 
07:21:21.990 --> 07:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
need this bill what authority did the
 
07:21:23.990 --> 07:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
department have to
 
07:21:24.000 --> 07:21:24.948 align:start position:0%
department have to
to

07:21:24.948 --> 07:21:24.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:21:29.590 --> 07:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:31.190 --> 07:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
is that a question to us right here
 
07:21:31.200 --> 07:21:32.948 align:start position:0%
is that a question to us right here
today

07:21:32.948 --> 07:21:32.958 align:start position:0%
today
 
07:21:34.948 --> 07:21:34.958 align:start position:0%
i i think that maybe you want to ask
 
07:21:37.190 --> 07:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
that question as a commissioner i i well
 
07:21:39.190 --> 07:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
maybe i could ask it of the
 
07:21:57.030 --> 07:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:59.990 --> 07:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
hello um i understand from a
 
07:22:02.310 --> 07:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
representation from nea that that was
 
07:22:04.310 --> 07:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
recently stated i'm just not aware of
 
07:22:04.320 --> 07:22:05.190 align:start position:0%
recently stated i'm just not aware of
that

07:22:05.190 --> 07:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:22:05.200 --> 07:22:07.190 align:start position:0%
that
um

07:22:07.190 --> 07:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:22:09.270 --> 07:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
and i can i can get you that information
 
07:22:10.788 --> 07:22:10.798 align:start position:0%
but it can't be
 
07:22:13.430 --> 07:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
at this very second i i i understand
 
07:22:15.670 --> 07:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
that but but is there any sort of
 
07:22:19.830 --> 07:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
underlying um either ruler or statute
 
07:22:22.708 --> 07:22:22.718 align:start position:0%
that supports the commissioners um
 
07:22:22.718 --> 07:22:23.590 align:start position:0%
that supports the commissioners um
um

07:22:23.590 --> 07:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:22:25.750 --> 07:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
at least what we've heard is a
 
07:22:27.750 --> 07:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
declaration to school boards through
 
07:22:30.070 --> 07:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
their superintendents that such policies
 
07:22:30.080 --> 07:22:30.708 align:start position:0%
their superintendents that such policies
are

07:22:30.708 --> 07:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
are
 
07:22:39.270 --> 07:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:40.628 --> 07:22:40.638 align:start position:0%
it is related to this bill because i
 
07:22:43.430 --> 07:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
think that's what this bill um goes at
 
07:22:47.110 --> 07:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
and and um and the the the question here
 
07:22:50.310 --> 07:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
is if this bill is necessary then then
 
07:22:52.788 --> 07:22:52.798 align:start position:0%
the department overstepped its bounds
 
07:22:55.830 --> 07:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
and and um and if this bill isn't
 
07:22:55.840 --> 07:22:57.270 align:start position:0%
and and um and if this bill isn't
necessary

07:22:57.270 --> 07:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
07:22:59.830 --> 07:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
then um then why why would we proceed
 
07:23:02.948 --> 07:23:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:03.830 --> 07:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
i think
 
07:23:04.948 --> 07:23:04.958 align:start position:0%
that's right yeah yeah and i think
 
07:23:06.788 --> 07:23:06.798 align:start position:0%
that's you know maybe i'm jumping the
 
07:23:08.150 --> 07:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
gun because we're so
 
07:23:09.350 --> 07:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
actually we haven't voted on the
 
07:23:10.788 --> 07:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
amendment but
 
07:23:12.548 --> 07:23:12.558 align:start position:0%
um i think we'll
 
07:23:13.990 --> 07:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
vote on the amendment and quickly vote
 
07:23:15.030 --> 07:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
on the bill
 
07:23:17.990 --> 07:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
um but i think it goes to
 
07:23:18.000 --> 07:23:19.030 align:start position:0%
um but i think it goes to
if

07:23:19.030 --> 07:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
if
 
07:23:23.990 --> 07:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:26.788 --> 07:23:26.798 align:start position:0%
if your question is
 
07:23:28.948 --> 07:23:28.958 align:start position:0%
what is the authority um that the
 
07:23:31.110 --> 07:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner acted
 
07:23:33.430 --> 07:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
under in issuing a mandate
 
07:23:35.350 --> 07:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
the short answer is i'm not sure because
 
07:23:37.270 --> 07:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
07:23:39.190 --> 07:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
what he ordered this
 
07:23:41.350 --> 07:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
school districts to do um my
 
07:23:44.150 --> 07:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
understanding is nea
 
07:23:45.670 --> 07:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
made that statement so they might know
 
07:23:47.030 --> 07:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
better than i do
 
07:23:48.388 --> 07:23:48.398 align:start position:0%
i'm just not in a position to answer
 
07:23:50.388 --> 07:23:50.398 align:start position:0%
that question unfortunately
 
07:23:51.990 --> 07:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
i i don't know the context in which it
 
07:23:55.110 --> 07:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:57.030 --> 07:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
you don't know the context which the the
 
07:23:59.030 --> 07:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
mandate that the commissioner made to
 
07:23:59.830 --> 07:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
school boards through their
 
07:24:01.350 --> 07:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
superintendents was good
 
07:24:02.948 --> 07:24:02.958 align:start position:0%
no i don't know anything i don't know
 
07:24:04.948 --> 07:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
anything about that okay
 
07:24:07.510 --> 07:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:10.388 --> 07:24:10.398 align:start position:0%
okay uh are there thank you very much
 
07:24:14.468 --> 07:24:14.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:14.478 --> 07:24:15.590 align:start position:0%
 
tanner

07:24:15.590 --> 07:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
tanner
 
07:24:17.750 --> 07:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you i just i just once again want
 
07:24:21.030 --> 07:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
to say and this isn't for uh represent
 
07:24:23.510 --> 07:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
or attorney fenton but once you
 
07:24:25.990 --> 07:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
weaponize the code of conduct
 
07:24:27.910 --> 07:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
you lose all credibility
 
07:24:31.830 --> 07:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
with me and teachers across the state
 
07:24:35.350 --> 07:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
and what was sold to us
 
07:24:37.990 --> 07:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
as um
 
07:24:40.310 --> 07:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
something that was going to be helpful
 
07:24:42.708 --> 07:24:42.718 align:start position:0%
make kids safe is now
 
07:24:46.708 --> 07:24:46.718 align:start position:0%
being weaponized for a violation of
 
07:24:49.990 --> 07:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
following the policies of your school
 
07:24:53.430 --> 07:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
i i just i can't wrap my head around why
 
07:24:55.350 --> 07:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
anybody would vote for this amendment
 
07:25:02.468 --> 07:25:02.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:04.310 --> 07:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
07:25:11.510 --> 07:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:11.520 --> 07:25:13.350 align:start position:0%
 
tired

07:25:13.350 --> 07:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
tired
 
07:25:18.548 --> 07:25:18.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:19.910 --> 07:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
07:25:21.990 --> 07:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
follow the policy
 
07:25:23.990 --> 07:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
if someone mandates
 
07:25:24.000 --> 07:25:26.388 align:start position:0%
if someone mandates
masks

07:25:26.388 --> 07:25:26.398 align:start position:0%
masks
 
07:25:26.398 --> 07:25:27.350 align:start position:0%
masks
that

07:25:27.350 --> 07:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:25:31.030 --> 07:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
is not authorized um and i i think the i
 
07:25:33.830 --> 07:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
don't know anything about the um
 
07:25:36.548 --> 07:25:36.558 align:start position:0%
call that uh you know the commissioner
 
07:25:38.070 --> 07:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
might have had with
 
07:25:41.030 --> 07:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
someone or some people um all i know is
 
07:25:43.190 --> 07:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
that the governor departments of health
 
07:25:45.430 --> 07:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
and the department of education
 
07:25:47.910 --> 07:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
said that mass use should be based on
 
07:25:49.830 --> 07:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
individual choice
 
07:25:53.670 --> 07:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
but if a school or the teacher is
 
07:25:53.680 --> 07:25:55.110 align:start position:0%
but if a school or the teacher is
mandating

07:25:55.110 --> 07:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
mandating
 
07:25:57.110 --> 07:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
it in their school or their classroom i
 
07:25:58.548 --> 07:25:58.558 align:start position:0%
think that's where the issue is and
 
07:26:03.110 --> 07:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:06.468 --> 07:26:06.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:08.868 --> 07:26:08.878 align:start position:0%
i i'm just going to state my position on
 
07:26:11.350 --> 07:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
it that i think that
 
07:26:13.830 --> 07:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
an employee that's following
 
07:26:16.468 --> 07:26:16.478 align:start position:0%
board directive
 
07:26:19.190 --> 07:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
if there's some kind of an action that's
 
07:26:22.310 --> 07:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
taken for whatever may be occurring
 
07:26:24.070 --> 07:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
and if you are following that board
 
07:26:24.080 --> 07:26:25.270 align:start position:0%
and if you are following that board
directive

07:26:25.270 --> 07:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
directive
 
07:26:27.590 --> 07:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
then the responsible
 
07:26:27.600 --> 07:26:28.868 align:start position:0%
then the responsible
entity

07:26:28.868 --> 07:26:28.878 align:start position:0%
entity
 
07:26:30.788 --> 07:26:30.798 align:start position:0%
should be the board
 
07:26:33.190 --> 07:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
not the teacher because the teachers in
 
07:26:35.030 --> 07:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
an employment status and they're doing
 
07:26:37.910 --> 07:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
what they did uh supposed to be doing
 
07:26:40.230 --> 07:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
when i was
 
07:26:42.230 --> 07:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
in the service
 
07:26:45.510 --> 07:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
and my boss my boss was a one-star
 
07:26:47.750 --> 07:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
general i was with him six seven eight
 
07:26:49.110 --> 07:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
hours a day
 
07:26:52.708 --> 07:26:52.718 align:start position:0%
when i was told to do something i did it
 
07:26:54.868 --> 07:26:54.878 align:start position:0%
and i saw some things which were not
 
07:26:57.670 --> 07:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
what i should be doing
 
07:26:59.350 --> 07:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
but i did it
 
07:27:01.350 --> 07:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
07:27:03.110 --> 07:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
what you're taught in the military now
 
07:27:04.468 --> 07:27:04.478 align:start position:0%
this is not the military we're talking
 
07:27:05.750 --> 07:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
about schools here we're talking about
 
07:27:07.270 --> 07:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
employment but it's a similar type
 
07:27:07.280 --> 07:27:08.708 align:start position:0%
employment but it's a similar type
situation

07:27:08.708 --> 07:27:08.718 align:start position:0%
situation
 
07:27:11.910 --> 07:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
so i i i'm of the opinion and i will
 
07:27:14.150 --> 07:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
publicly announce it that
 
07:27:14.160 --> 07:27:14.948 align:start position:0%
publicly announce it that
that

07:27:14.948 --> 07:27:14.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:27:16.310 --> 07:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
if in fact
 
07:27:18.310 --> 07:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
that employee is told to do something
 
07:27:20.070 --> 07:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
and that's in accordance with that board
 
07:27:20.080 --> 07:27:21.190 align:start position:0%
and that's in accordance with that board
policy

07:27:21.190 --> 07:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
policy
 
07:27:23.670 --> 07:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh unless it's some kind of a borders
 
07:27:23.680 --> 07:27:24.788 align:start position:0%
uh unless it's some kind of a borders
criminal

07:27:24.788 --> 07:27:24.798 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
07:27:26.868 --> 07:27:26.878 align:start position:0%
uh i will probably follow through what
 
07:27:28.948 --> 07:27:28.958 align:start position:0%
i've been told to do
 
07:27:32.230 --> 07:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
and and i'll let the cards fall
 
07:27:34.868 --> 07:27:34.878 align:start position:0%
and hopefully uh reasonable people would
 
07:27:37.590 --> 07:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
come in and say that the educators not
 
07:27:40.070 --> 07:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
to lose the credential here
 
07:27:40.080 --> 07:27:40.868 align:start position:0%
to lose the credential here
um

07:27:40.868 --> 07:27:40.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:27:43.190 --> 07:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
or e or to be reprimand i know there's
 
07:27:44.948 --> 07:27:44.958 align:start position:0%
three levels and we've recommended
 
07:27:46.788 --> 07:27:46.798 align:start position:0%
through letter a fourth
 
07:27:48.628 --> 07:27:48.638 align:start position:0%
uh confidential letter placed in the
 
07:27:50.788 --> 07:27:50.798 align:start position:0%
file or a confidence letter to the
 
07:27:52.788 --> 07:27:52.798 align:start position:0%
teacher or to the employee because it's
 
07:27:54.230 --> 07:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
not just teachers this is principles
 
07:27:56.468 --> 07:27:56.478 align:start position:0%
administrators everybody has a ticket
 
07:27:58.948 --> 07:27:58.958 align:start position:0%

103h
 
07:28:15.910 --> 07:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
that that that eliminates the um the
 
07:28:18.070 --> 07:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
takes the code of conduct
 
07:28:21.350 --> 07:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
out of the picture here it still
 
07:28:24.388 --> 07:28:24.398 align:start position:0%
contains the um the right of the
 
07:28:26.150 --> 07:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
right of private action
 
07:28:28.788 --> 07:28:28.798 align:start position:0%

relief
 
07:28:40.948 --> 07:28:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:44.388 --> 07:28:44.398 align:start position:0%
because when i look at the
 
07:28:46.230 --> 07:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
the other amendment which we're not
 
07:28:48.310 --> 07:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
talking about at the moment
 
07:28:51.030 --> 07:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not supportive of this uh being
 
07:28:53.110 --> 07:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
applied to
 
07:28:56.788 --> 07:28:56.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:59.190 --> 07:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
and and so you know they're they're i'm
 
07:29:01.830 --> 07:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
looking at both of them from you know
 
07:29:05.270 --> 07:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
there's parts of each um
 
07:29:08.548 --> 07:29:08.558 align:start position:0%
and regardless how this filters out um
 
07:29:09.830 --> 07:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
you know we're gonna have to live with
 
07:29:12.948 --> 07:29:12.958 align:start position:0%
it or vote contrary on the house floor
 
07:29:14.548 --> 07:29:14.558 align:start position:0%
however you want to vote your conscience
 
07:29:16.388 --> 07:29:16.398 align:start position:0%
there but
 
07:29:17.910 --> 07:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
that's how i respond to your question
 
07:29:19.910 --> 07:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
there i think it's i'm
 
07:29:21.510 --> 07:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
oppositional to the part where we're
 
07:29:25.190 --> 07:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
referencing accredited non-public school
 
07:29:25.200 --> 07:29:26.868 align:start position:0%
referencing accredited non-public school
um

07:29:26.868 --> 07:29:26.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:29:28.708 --> 07:29:28.718 align:start position:0%
i i don't think that's necessary to have
 
07:29:30.468 --> 07:29:30.478 align:start position:0%
in the bill at all
 
07:29:33.510 --> 07:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
okay and and and i no i i certainly
 
07:29:35.430 --> 07:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
recognize your position on that
 
07:29:37.670 --> 07:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
recognize your your position
 
07:29:39.350 --> 07:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
seems to be generally opposed to the
 
07:29:40.948 --> 07:29:40.958 align:start position:0%
roman 3
 
07:29:40.958 --> 07:29:42.070 align:start position:0%
roman 3
section

07:29:42.070 --> 07:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
section
 
07:29:45.270 --> 07:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
of it certainly if it's used if a if a
 
07:29:47.830 --> 07:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
if uh if an educator is following school
 
07:29:49.270 --> 07:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
board policy
 
07:29:49.280 --> 07:29:51.510 align:start position:0%
board policy
um

07:29:51.510 --> 07:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:29:52.868 --> 07:29:52.878 align:start position:0%
and i think we're probably running out
 
07:29:55.510 --> 07:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
of time in terms of amendments on this
 
07:29:55.520 --> 07:29:57.830 align:start position:0%
of time in terms of amendments on this
bill

07:29:57.830 --> 07:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:00.070 --> 07:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
but again i think that's that's another
 
07:30:03.270 --> 07:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
indicator that um that a committee with
 
07:30:04.868 --> 07:30:04.878 align:start position:0%
103 bills
 
07:30:04.878 --> 07:30:05.670 align:start position:0%
103 bills
and

07:30:05.670 --> 07:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:30:07.590 --> 07:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
passing something that just isn't ready
 
07:30:10.548 --> 07:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
for for prime time it's uh
 
07:30:12.788 --> 07:30:12.798 align:start position:0%
neither one of these amendments may be
 
07:30:15.510 --> 07:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
maybe um maybe ready
 
07:30:16.628 --> 07:30:16.638 align:start position:0%
and um
 
07:30:20.070 --> 07:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
and i think that's that's it's very very
 
07:30:21.590 --> 07:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
legitimate to
 
07:30:23.590 --> 07:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
to you know vote your conscience on an
 
07:30:27.430 --> 07:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:30.070 --> 07:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
okay is there further discussion we do
 
07:30:32.150 --> 07:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
have a
 
07:30:33.910 --> 07:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
motion yes
 
07:30:36.310 --> 07:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
i've heard it said before that um
 
07:30:39.190 --> 07:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps the other body could clean it up
 
07:30:42.230 --> 07:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
if we just pass it
 
07:30:44.468 --> 07:30:44.478 align:start position:0%
yeah see it's also contrary to you know
 
07:30:46.708 --> 07:30:46.718 align:start position:0%
i i we try to send as as much because
 
07:30:48.708 --> 07:30:48.718 align:start position:0%
that other body sometimes doesn't clean
 
07:30:51.830 --> 07:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
it up they mess it up more
 
07:30:51.840 --> 07:30:53.350 align:start position:0%
it up they mess it up more
so

07:30:53.350 --> 07:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:30:55.590 --> 07:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
the other side of the wall sometimes the
 
07:30:57.270 --> 07:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
other side of the wall
 
07:30:59.830 --> 07:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
and a good group of people but
 
07:31:01.990 --> 07:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't always work
 
07:31:03.590 --> 07:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
for those who've been around seen in a
 
07:31:07.990 --> 07:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
while it's it's crazy world we live in
 
07:31:08.000 --> 07:31:08.708 align:start position:0%
while it's it's crazy world we live in
so

07:31:08.708 --> 07:31:08.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:31:08.718 --> 07:31:09.670 align:start position:0%
so
um

07:31:09.670 --> 07:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:31:11.830 --> 07:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
07:31:11.840 --> 07:31:13.030 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
okay

07:31:13.030 --> 07:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:31:15.270 --> 07:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
i think we're ready to call the roll on
 
07:31:22.868 --> 07:31:22.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:25.510 --> 07:31:25.520 align:start position:0%

yes i um
 
07:34:32.230 --> 07:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
very much liked the idea of this bill
 
07:34:33.350 --> 07:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
but in
 
07:34:36.230 --> 07:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
hearings we did hear that there were
 
07:34:38.948 --> 07:34:38.958 align:start position:0%
some issues with the way it was worded
 
07:34:40.628 --> 07:34:40.638 align:start position:0%
it wasn't worded as well as some of
 
07:34:43.190 --> 07:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
these other bills where we have said
 
07:34:44.788 --> 07:34:44.798 align:start position:0%
except for
 
07:34:46.070 --> 07:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
you know where it was needed for
 
07:34:48.388 --> 07:34:48.398 align:start position:0%
visiting like nursing homes or
 
07:34:54.788 --> 07:34:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:58.070 --> 07:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
i would like to see this cleaned up and
 
07:35:00.070 --> 07:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
hand it back
 
07:35:03.190 --> 07:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
07:35:05.990 --> 07:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative thanks mr chair yeah
 
07:35:07.910 --> 07:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
i think just like um what was the bill
 
07:35:10.230 --> 07:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
we just did
 
07:35:12.468 --> 07:35:12.478 align:start position:0%
one one three one this is a public
 
07:35:14.868 --> 07:35:14.878 align:start position:0%
school um
 
07:35:18.230 --> 07:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
haters bill and um and so uh i don't
 
07:35:20.388 --> 07:35:20.398 align:start position:0%
think it's worthy of interim study i
 
07:35:23.270 --> 07:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
think it's worth a a dumpster fire
 
07:35:25.190 --> 07:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
and um and should be
 
07:35:26.548 --> 07:35:26.558 align:start position:0%
thrown there

but i
 
07:39:19.670 --> 07:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
i don't see the the value of this bill
 
07:39:19.680 --> 07:39:20.948 align:start position:0%
i don't see the the value of this bill
when

07:39:20.948 --> 07:39:20.958 align:start position:0%
when
 
07:39:22.788 --> 07:39:22.798 align:start position:0%
the the bigger essence of the bill
 
07:39:25.910 --> 07:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
beyond the the vaccination is the fact
 
07:39:27.670 --> 07:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
that we continue to say
 
07:39:29.670 --> 07:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
you guys keep flipping you know like
 
07:39:31.190 --> 07:39:31.200 align:start position:0%

it's you know it's a rule that should be
 
07:39:46.948 --> 07:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
made by this superintendent and the
 
07:39:49.190 --> 07:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
school board shouldn't be rules made by
 
07:39:50.948 --> 07:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
us down here
 
07:39:52.868 --> 07:39:52.878 align:start position:0%

07:40:04.708 --> 07:40:04.718 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock's local uh
 
07:40:06.230 --> 07:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
local controlled
 
07:40:08.948 --> 07:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
idea vaccinations are usually under the
 
07:40:11.670 --> 07:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
purview of the um
 
07:40:13.670 --> 07:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
the health and human services
 
07:40:16.788 --> 07:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
and not under education so um
 
07:40:18.388 --> 07:40:18.398 align:start position:0%
i think this bill is totally in the
 
07:40:20.310 --> 07:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
wrong place
 
07:40:22.310 --> 07:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
07:40:25.030 --> 07:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
yes represent cordelia uh thank you the
 
07:40:27.670 --> 07:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
other bill that i was uh referring to
 
07:40:30.070 --> 07:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
that does mandate vaccinations in order
 
07:40:32.708 --> 07:40:32.718 align:start position:0%
to attend a public school is placed in
 
07:40:36.708 --> 07:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
the public health uh section um of law
 
07:40:40.628 --> 07:40:40.638 align:start position:0%
so uh i i think that this is um
 
07:40:43.430 --> 07:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh needed for that reason
 
07:40:45.510 --> 07:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
represent luno
 
07:40:48.150 --> 07:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so um yes we actually

department of health and human services
 
07:40:55.750 --> 07:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
who specifically said that this bill is
 
07:40:58.628 --> 07:40:58.638 align:start position:0%
not necessary since only uh
 
07:41:00.548 --> 07:41:00.558 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the department of
 
07:41:03.430 --> 07:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
health and human services can authorize
 
07:41:07.430 --> 07:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
a vaccine be required for um for schools
 
07:41:10.868 --> 07:41:10.878 align:start position:0%
so and that's done through rsa 141 c
 
07:41:12.948 --> 07:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
colon 20. so
 
07:41:12.958 --> 07:41:13.830 align:start position:0%
colon 20. so

so
 
07:41:17.110 --> 07:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
this bill um is um is definitely not
 
07:41:17.120 --> 07:41:17.990 align:start position:0%
this bill um is um is definitely not
needed

07:41:17.990 --> 07:41:18.000 align:start position:0%

of uh
 
07:44:28.558 --> 07:44:29.990 align:start position:0%
of uh
itl

07:44:29.990 --> 07:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
itl
 
07:44:38.548 --> 07:44:38.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:40.788 --> 07:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
i can at the second can speak first and
 
07:44:42.468 --> 07:44:42.478 align:start position:0%
the first can speak second that'd be
 
07:44:42.478 --> 07:44:44.788 align:start position:0%
the first can speak second that'd be
fine

07:44:44.788 --> 07:44:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:46.868 --> 07:44:46.878 align:start position:0%
um one of the things they were talking
 
07:44:49.030 --> 07:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
about in in this
 
07:44:49.040 --> 07:44:50.548 align:start position:0%
about in in this
was

07:44:50.548 --> 07:44:50.558 align:start position:0%
was
 
07:44:52.310 --> 07:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
well somebody could just bring in a
 
07:44:54.150 --> 07:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
medical exemption
 
07:44:58.628 --> 07:44:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:00.948 --> 07:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
certain departments in the federal
 
07:45:03.110 --> 07:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
government have passed down to the heads
 
07:45:07.430 --> 07:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
of certain hospital associations that if
 
07:45:10.628 --> 07:45:10.638 align:start position:0%
any of their doctors
 
07:45:12.628 --> 07:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
issue a medical exemption they'll be
 
07:45:12.638 --> 07:45:14.548 align:start position:0%
issue a medical exemption they'll be
fired

07:45:14.548 --> 07:45:14.558 align:start position:0%
fired
 
07:45:15.990 --> 07:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
so it makes it kind of hard to get a
 
07:45:17.590 --> 07:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
medical exemption
 
07:45:20.548 --> 07:45:20.558 align:start position:0%
and and i know that there was a nurse at
 
07:45:20.558 --> 07:45:21.750 align:start position:0%
and and i know that there was a nurse at
concord

07:45:21.750 --> 07:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
concord
 
07:45:23.670 --> 07:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
whose doctor did want her to have a
 
07:45:26.150 --> 07:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
medical exemption
 
07:45:28.548 --> 07:45:28.558 align:start position:0%
couldn't give it to her
 
07:45:30.948 --> 07:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
he knew she might be at risk but on the
 
07:45:33.350 --> 07:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
other hand if she didn't get
 
07:45:35.750 --> 07:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
the vaccine she would be fired from her
 
07:45:35.760 --> 07:45:36.948 align:start position:0%
the vaccine she would be fired from her
job

07:45:36.948 --> 07:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
job
 
07:45:39.510 --> 07:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
she got it and with it and they tell me
 
07:45:42.150 --> 07:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
she was within 10 to 15 seconds of being
 
07:45:42.160 --> 07:45:43.350 align:start position:0%
she was within 10 to 15 seconds of being
dead

07:45:43.350 --> 07:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
dead
 
07:45:45.670 --> 07:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
because she went into anaphylactic shock
 
07:45:48.548 --> 07:45:48.558 align:start position:0%
which is what the doctor was afraid of
 
07:45:48.558 --> 07:45:49.750 align:start position:0%
which is what the doctor was afraid of
so

07:45:49.750 --> 07:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:45:51.910 --> 07:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
threatening people with their jobs one
 
07:45:53.510 --> 07:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
way or the other
 
07:45:55.670 --> 07:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
is inexcusable and in this case you're
 
07:45:57.350 --> 07:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
threatening somebody
 
07:46:00.310 --> 07:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
with their chance of being able to even
 
07:46:02.788 --> 07:46:02.798 align:start position:0%
get a k an education to get a job and
 
07:46:05.830 --> 07:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
that is unacceptable thank you
 
07:46:08.788 --> 07:46:08.798 align:start position:0%

07:46:10.788 --> 07:46:10.798 align:start position:0%

07:46:27.750 --> 07:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative leakers say threatening
 
07:46:29.670 --> 07:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
people with their jobs is unconscionable
 
07:46:31.350 --> 07:46:31.360 align:start position:0%

certain jobs require certain
prerequisites

07:46:51.590 --> 07:46:51.600 align:start position:0%

some of those prerequisites are
 
07:46:58.548 --> 07:46:58.558 align:start position:0%
vaccinations so that you are not
 
07:46:58.558 --> 07:46:59.670 align:start position:0%
vaccinations so that you are not
um

07:46:59.670 --> 07:46:59.680 align:start position:0%

um
at

07:47:00.388 --> 07:47:00.398 align:start position:0%
at
 
07:47:02.388 --> 07:47:02.398 align:start position:0%
a point where you're
 
07:47:04.388 --> 07:47:04.398 align:start position:0%
spreading germs
 
07:47:04.398 --> 07:47:05.910 align:start position:0%
spreading germs
bacteria

07:47:05.910 --> 07:47:05.920 align:start position:0%

07:47:07.510 --> 07:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
viruses
 
07:47:08.788 --> 07:47:08.798 align:start position:0%
um on
 
07:47:11.670 --> 07:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
people who are the most vulnerable and
 
07:47:14.788 --> 07:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
that's been something that's um
 
07:47:17.350 --> 07:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
in the medical field for a long time
 
07:47:19.110 --> 07:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
in fact when i first started teaching
 
07:47:22.788 --> 07:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:25.910 --> 07:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
and some places had chest x-rays and and
 
07:47:25.920 --> 07:47:26.868 align:start position:0%
and some places had chest x-rays and and
uh

07:47:26.868 --> 07:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:47:29.590 --> 07:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
had to get vaccinations um you know to
 
07:47:31.190 --> 07:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
be an emt
 
07:47:32.788 --> 07:47:32.798 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
07:47:34.868 --> 07:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
this is something that um
 
07:47:37.350 --> 07:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
really flies in the face of
 
07:47:39.830 --> 07:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know the history of our nation the
 
07:47:42.150 --> 07:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
history of jobs the things that have
 
07:47:42.160 --> 07:47:43.430 align:start position:0%
history of jobs the things that have
worked

07:47:43.430 --> 07:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
worked
 
07:47:43.440 --> 07:47:44.948 align:start position:0%
worked
into

07:47:44.948 --> 07:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
into
 
07:47:48.548 --> 07:47:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:50.628 --> 07:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
further disguise represent luna
 
07:47:52.628 --> 07:47:52.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair um you know
 
07:47:54.708 --> 07:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
what's really exciting about um some of
 
07:47:56.388 --> 07:47:56.398 align:start position:0%
the some of the improvements that have
 
07:47:56.398 --> 07:47:57.270 align:start position:0%
the some of the improvements that have
been

07:47:57.270 --> 07:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
been
 
07:47:58.948 --> 07:47:58.958 align:start position:0%
uh that have come out during this
 
07:48:00.708 --> 07:48:00.718 align:start position:0%
session is that we're live streamed on
 
07:48:02.310 --> 07:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
youtube and that these videos are going
 
07:48:04.468 --> 07:48:04.478 align:start position:0%
to be around for a while so i know it
 
07:48:06.468 --> 07:48:06.478 align:start position:0%
was said a lot last session people are
 
07:48:08.708 --> 07:48:08.718 align:start position:0%
watching but people really are watching
 
07:48:09.990 --> 07:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
and i think they've got a great
 
07:48:12.230 --> 07:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity particularly particularly
 
07:48:14.868 --> 07:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
today to know who your representatives
 
07:48:16.868 --> 07:48:16.878 align:start position:0%
are and how they vote on important
 
07:48:19.750 --> 07:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
issues and so people are watching and
 
07:48:21.590 --> 07:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
i'm really glad for that and i think
 
07:48:23.270 --> 07:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
november is really going to show the
 
07:48:26.868 --> 07:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:30.310 --> 07:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:31.350 --> 07:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:48:32.948 --> 07:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
mr chair and and thank you
 
07:48:34.628 --> 07:48:34.638 align:start position:0%
representative luno for pointing that
 
07:48:36.788 --> 07:48:36.798 align:start position:0%
out um i think it's very important to
 
07:48:38.628 --> 07:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
know how your representatives vote on
 
07:48:40.868 --> 07:48:40.878 align:start position:0%
important things that affect your your
 
07:48:43.990 --> 07:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
medical uh privacy your your family and
 
07:48:46.468 --> 07:48:46.478 align:start position:0%
medical decisions so i'm sure that my
 
07:48:48.948 --> 07:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
constituents i mean i'm here
 
07:48:51.350 --> 07:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
as a result of them putting me here so
 
07:48:53.670 --> 07:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
that isn't why i wanted to speak
 
07:48:55.990 --> 07:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
but i think that the other part that
 
07:48:58.548 --> 07:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
we're not paying attention to is natural
 
07:48:58.558 --> 07:48:59.670 align:start position:0%
we're not paying attention to is natural
immunity

07:48:59.670 --> 07:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
immunity
 
07:49:02.948 --> 07:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
they refute there has been no
 
07:49:05.430 --> 07:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
validation for natural immunity
 
07:49:05.440 --> 07:49:06.468 align:start position:0%
validation for natural immunity
and

07:49:06.468 --> 07:49:06.478 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:49:06.478 --> 07:49:07.350 align:start position:0%
and
if

07:49:07.350 --> 07:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
if
 
07:49:10.150 --> 07:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not a scientist i don't know who
 
07:49:12.788 --> 07:49:12.798 align:start position:0%
who on this board is a scientist
 
07:49:14.708 --> 07:49:14.718 align:start position:0%
but there is
 
07:49:17.110 --> 07:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
information that we don't have about
 
07:49:19.670 --> 07:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not this is a vaccine or a
 
07:49:22.628 --> 07:49:22.638 align:start position:0%
therapeutic and i will leave the medical
 
07:49:25.110 --> 07:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
decisions to medical people and i would
 
07:49:27.030 --> 07:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
like my family decisions to be my
 
07:49:27.040 --> 07:49:29.190 align:start position:0%
like my family decisions to be my
decision

07:49:29.190 --> 07:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
decision
 
07:49:31.110 --> 07:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cordelli uh
 
07:49:32.868 --> 07:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
thank you and just to follow up on that
 
07:49:34.788 --> 07:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
i believe that there are uh numerous
 
07:49:37.430 --> 07:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
studies about uh natural immunity
 
07:49:41.990 --> 07:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
and um many that even uh um have uh
 
07:49:46.868 --> 07:49:46.878 align:start position:0%
um found a much greater uh prevention um
 
07:49:48.468 --> 07:49:48.478 align:start position:0%
when there is natural immunity as
 
07:49:51.430 --> 07:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
opposed to the vaccination
 
07:49:53.590 --> 07:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
further just represent tanner
 
07:49:55.430 --> 07:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
yes i'd just like to say that you know
 
07:49:57.270 --> 07:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
we're concerned with the enrollment in
 
07:49:59.430 --> 07:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
our colleges and universities
 
07:49:59.440 --> 07:50:00.310 align:start position:0%
our colleges and universities
and

07:50:00.310 --> 07:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:50:02.548 --> 07:50:02.558 align:start position:0%
i think parents may think twice
 
07:50:05.030 --> 07:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
about sending their kids to unh or
 
07:50:07.430 --> 07:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
granite state college
 
07:50:07.440 --> 07:50:08.388 align:start position:0%
granite state college
if

07:50:08.388 --> 07:50:08.398 align:start position:0%
if
 
07:50:10.070 --> 07:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
they realize that a lot of people are
 
07:50:11.670 --> 07:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
going there without the basic
 
07:50:11.680 --> 07:50:13.190 align:start position:0%
going there without the basic
vaccinations

07:50:13.190 --> 07:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
07:50:15.190 --> 07:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
i grew up in an age when
 
07:50:17.510 --> 07:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
we had people in iron lungs because of
 
07:50:17.520 --> 07:50:18.788 align:start position:0%
we had people in iron lungs because of
polio

07:50:18.788 --> 07:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
polio
 
07:50:23.350 --> 07:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
and now it's eradicated in in the world
 
07:50:26.948 --> 07:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
almost because of or smallpox i had
 
07:50:29.750 --> 07:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
i had smallpox vaccination and then when
 
07:50:32.230 --> 07:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
i went overseas when i was like 18 i had
 
07:50:34.070 --> 07:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
to have another small tax vaccination
 
07:50:36.388 --> 07:50:36.398 align:start position:0%
and smallpox is another
 
07:50:36.398 --> 07:50:37.430 align:start position:0%
and smallpox is another
uh

07:50:37.430 --> 07:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:50:39.670 --> 07:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
very nasty disease that's been almost
 
07:50:41.910 --> 07:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
totally eradicated in in the world and
 
07:50:44.948 --> 07:50:44.958 align:start position:0%
it's because of vaccinations
 
07:50:45.910 --> 07:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:50:50.150 --> 07:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:52.230 --> 07:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
i didn't want to get into this but you
 
07:50:55.030 --> 07:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
brought small pox up smallpox was a true
 
07:50:55.040 --> 07:50:56.548 align:start position:0%
brought small pox up smallpox was a true
vaccination

07:50:56.548 --> 07:50:56.558 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
07:50:58.628 --> 07:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
if you took the small fox vaccination
 
07:51:01.350 --> 07:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
you did not get smallpox if you take
 
07:51:04.388 --> 07:51:04.398 align:start position:0%
this vaccination you can still get
 
07:51:06.628 --> 07:51:06.638 align:start position:0%
coven 19 in fact you can get it three
 
07:51:06.638 --> 07:51:08.230 align:start position:0%
coven 19 in fact you can get it three
times

07:51:08.230 --> 07:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
times
 
07:51:08.240 --> 07:51:08.948 align:start position:0%
times
as

07:51:08.948 --> 07:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
as
 
07:51:11.590 --> 07:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
some people here we know
 
07:51:13.750 --> 07:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
and so the point is
 
07:51:15.990 --> 07:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
this vaccination
 
07:51:18.548 --> 07:51:18.558 align:start position:0%
does not and was never designed to keep
 
07:51:21.430 --> 07:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
you from getting coveted it was designed
 
07:51:23.990 --> 07:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
to keep you from getting as sick it was
 
07:51:27.350 --> 07:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
designed to keep you out of the hospital
 
07:51:30.708 --> 07:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
and also and this is according to the
 
07:51:34.548 --> 07:51:34.558 align:start position:0%
cdc by the way and according to the cdc
 
07:51:36.468 --> 07:51:36.478 align:start position:0%
it does not keep you from spreading the
 
07:51:39.270 --> 07:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
disease either which was why in the
 
07:51:40.868 --> 07:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
beginning when they brought it out they
 
07:51:43.110 --> 07:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
said please keep wearing masks because
 
07:51:45.110 --> 07:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
this will not keep you
 
07:51:45.120 --> 07:51:45.990 align:start position:0%
this will not keep you
from

07:51:45.990 --> 07:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
from
 
07:51:47.830 --> 07:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
spreading the disease it will not keep
 
07:51:49.670 --> 07:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
you from getting the disease that was
 
07:51:51.750 --> 07:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
not the design the design was to keep
 
07:51:53.430 --> 07:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
you out of the hospital and to keep you
 
07:51:56.708 --> 07:51:56.718 align:start position:0%
from dying and so comparing those two
 
07:51:59.990 --> 07:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
are two totally different things thank
 
07:52:00.000 --> 07:52:00.948 align:start position:0%
are two totally different things thank
you

07:52:00.948 --> 07:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:52:03.030 --> 07:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
07:52:06.388 --> 07:52:06.398 align:start position:0%
is this bill just about covert because i
 
07:52:08.388 --> 07:52:08.398 align:start position:0%
reading the bill i thought it applied to
 
07:52:15.990 --> 07:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:18.230 --> 07:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
i think this one is uh
 
07:52:19.910 --> 07:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
relative code
 
07:52:21.750 --> 07:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
this is just cover that from what i got
 
07:52:33.510 --> 07:52:33.520 align:start position:0%

further

07:58:14.468 --> 07:58:14.478 align:start position:0%
further
 
07:58:16.868 --> 07:58:16.878 align:start position:0%
representative cornell
 
07:58:19.510 --> 07:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
if i could speak to my amendment which
 
07:58:21.510 --> 07:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
what the wording of which was given to
 
07:58:23.510 --> 07:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
me by becky fredet from the department
 
07:58:25.030 --> 07:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
of education
 
07:58:27.110 --> 07:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
thinking that this would help with the
 
07:58:27.120 --> 07:58:29.270 align:start position:0%
thinking that this would help with the
students

07:58:29.270 --> 07:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
students
 
07:58:32.708 --> 07:58:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:34.708 --> 07:58:34.718 align:start position:0%
parentally placed
 
07:58:36.310 --> 07:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
who are parentally placed with
 
07:58:39.270 --> 07:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
disabilities and all it does is ensure
 
07:58:41.350 --> 07:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
that the scholarship organization shall
 
07:58:42.948 --> 07:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
provide parents of students with
 
07:58:45.430 --> 07:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
disabilities who are not enrolled in a
 
07:58:47.830 --> 07:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
private elementary or secondary school
 
07:58:50.468 --> 07:58:50.478 align:start position:0%
an explanation of their rights that such
 
07:58:53.350 --> 07:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
students have under idea and any
 
07:58:56.070 --> 07:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
applicable state laws
 
07:58:58.468 --> 07:58:58.478 align:start position:0%
so all it does is ensure that parents
 
07:59:01.510 --> 07:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
receive a copy of what their rights are
 
07:59:03.590 --> 07:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
which i guess from
 
07:59:05.910 --> 07:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
history they don't always
 
07:59:08.388 --> 07:59:08.398 align:start position:0%
get a copy that's handed to them and
 
07:59:10.230 --> 07:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
explained they're given a lot of
 
07:59:12.868 --> 07:59:12.878 align:start position:0%
information as anybody who's ever seen
 
07:59:15.110 --> 07:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
special ed laws and rules
 
07:59:17.750 --> 07:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
knows so this is just to ensure that
 
07:59:19.510 --> 07:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
they know that
 
07:59:21.510 --> 07:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you
 
07:59:23.430 --> 07:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
07:59:25.430 --> 07:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
on the bill represent luna thank you
 
07:59:28.150 --> 07:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
very much yeah i i mean i think as as
 
07:59:30.388 --> 07:59:30.398 align:start position:0%
representative cornell was saying this
 
07:59:34.070 --> 07:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
um um this amendment was uh was really
 
07:59:36.948 --> 07:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
developed collaboratively with um with
 
07:59:39.430 --> 07:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
the department with um with attorney
 
07:59:39.440 --> 07:59:40.468 align:start position:0%
the department with um with attorney
zellin

07:59:40.468 --> 07:59:40.478 align:start position:0%
zellin
 
07:59:43.430 --> 07:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
and with um with others involved in um
 
07:59:46.548 --> 07:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
uh in this area and it's been through
 
07:59:49.110 --> 07:59:49.120 align:start position:0%
obviously the bill is introduced an
 
07:59:51.510 --> 07:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
earlier draft of the amendment which
 
07:59:53.510 --> 07:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
07:59:55.350 --> 07:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
took issue with the terms possess and
 
07:59:58.788 --> 07:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
wave we agreed with that and uh and then
 
08:00:02.310 --> 08:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
brought forth uh amendment 840 which um
 
08:00:04.628 --> 08:00:04.638 align:start position:0%
which really just makes it clear that
 
08:00:07.430 --> 08:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
that parentally what rights parentally
 
08:00:09.350 --> 08:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
placed students have
 
08:00:13.110 --> 08:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
not possess or waive but have under idea
 
08:00:15.030 --> 08:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
in any applicable state laws it does it
 
08:00:16.948 --> 08:00:16.958 align:start position:0%
in two different places here
 
08:00:19.350 --> 08:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
and it and it makes it clear
 
08:00:19.360 --> 08:00:20.230 align:start position:0%
and it and it makes it clear
that

08:00:20.230 --> 08:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:00:22.548 --> 08:00:22.558 align:start position:0%
that that parents of students with
 
08:00:22.558 --> 08:00:24.948 align:start position:0%
that that parents of students with
disabilities

08:00:24.948 --> 08:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
08:00:28.070 --> 08:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
in the efa program would receive an
 
08:00:30.388 --> 08:00:30.398 align:start position:0%
explanation of the rights that they have
 
08:00:33.430 --> 08:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
under idea and applicable state laws
 
08:00:35.430 --> 08:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
this makes a lot of sense
 
08:00:39.270 --> 08:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
this is is i think an example of a bill
 
08:00:41.270 --> 08:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
where where or particularly as of an
 
08:00:43.670 --> 08:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
amendment where where we're trying to
 
08:00:48.070 --> 08:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
work together to uh to to improve the
 
08:00:50.708 --> 08:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
the information that uh that parents of
 
08:00:53.030 --> 08:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities receive
 
08:00:55.110 --> 08:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
and um and you know we've taken into
 
08:00:55.120 --> 08:00:56.388 align:start position:0%
and um and you know we've taken into
consideration

08:00:56.388 --> 08:00:56.398 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
08:00:58.468 --> 08:00:58.478 align:start position:0%
i think the feedback that we had during
 
08:01:00.948 --> 08:01:00.958 align:start position:0%
earlier discussions on this bill with
 
08:01:03.990 --> 08:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
the language and to to summarily
 
08:01:07.670 --> 08:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
unilaterally reject it on party lines is
 
08:01:08.868 --> 08:01:08.878 align:start position:0%
is just
 
08:01:11.830 --> 08:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's no more shocking than a lot of
 
08:01:14.548 --> 08:01:14.558 align:start position:0%
other bills we've seen but i think given
 
08:01:17.270 --> 08:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
the um given the collaborative work
 
08:01:18.868 --> 08:01:18.878 align:start position:0%
given the department's interest in the
 
08:01:18.878 --> 08:01:19.990 align:start position:0%
given the department's interest in the
language

08:01:19.990 --> 08:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
language
 
08:01:23.430 --> 08:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
and um and given that uh that that you
 
08:01:26.150 --> 08:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
know it's it's um it's late and it's
 
08:01:28.468 --> 08:01:28.478 align:start position:0%
been and it's been done and i think it's
 
08:01:31.510 --> 08:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's ready to uh to go forward as not to
 
08:01:33.910 --> 08:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
pass as amended to the house that that
 
08:01:36.388 --> 08:01:36.398 align:start position:0%
we should um
 
08:01:39.030 --> 08:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
maybe consider withdrawing the itl
 
08:01:44.868 --> 08:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:48.548 --> 08:01:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:50.868 --> 08:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
i i like all the wording in this and i
 
08:01:53.510 --> 08:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
like the way you fixed it i'm still not
 
08:01:55.990 --> 08:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
understanding why it's necessary since
 
08:01:59.030 --> 08:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
it already says participation in the efa
 
08:02:01.990 --> 08:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
program is a parental placement under 20
 
08:02:05.190 --> 08:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
usc section 1412 and this is in the
 
08:02:07.590 --> 08:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
this is in the application
 
08:02:09.990 --> 08:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
so you can't possibly be in the program
 
08:02:11.990 --> 08:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
without getting this notification
 
08:02:13.430 --> 08:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
because you have to fill out the
 
08:02:15.750 --> 08:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
application so when you go to fill out
 
08:02:18.628 --> 08:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
the application it specifically says
 
08:02:20.708 --> 08:02:20.718 align:start position:0%
participation in the eff program is a
 
08:02:23.590 --> 08:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
parental placement under 20 usc section
 
08:02:26.548 --> 08:02:26.558 align:start position:0%
1412 individuals with disabilities well
 
08:02:28.548 --> 08:02:28.558 align:start position:0%
ida if a child with a disability is
 
08:02:30.628 --> 08:02:30.638 align:start position:0%
enrolled in a non-public school a child
 
08:02:32.468 --> 08:02:32.478 align:start position:0%
with a disability participating in an
 
08:02:34.230 --> 08:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
efa program and enrolled in a public
 
08:02:34.240 --> 08:02:35.110 align:start position:0%
efa program and enrolled in a public
school

08:02:35.110 --> 08:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
school
 
08:02:37.670 --> 08:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
under and it gives the rsa is not a
 
08:02:39.670 --> 08:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
parental placement under ida and shall
 
08:02:42.070 --> 08:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
be entitled to to fape
 
08:02:43.670 --> 08:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
parentally placed private school
 
08:02:45.670 --> 08:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
children with a disability shall not be
 
08:02:47.830 --> 08:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
entitled to a faith in connection with
 
08:02:49.590 --> 08:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
their enrollment by their parents in a
 
08:02:52.310 --> 08:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
private school according with and again
 
08:02:54.788 --> 08:02:54.798 align:start position:0%
it gives that and pursuant to
 
08:02:57.030 --> 08:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
another piece of law while participating
 
08:02:59.430 --> 08:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
in the state-funded efa program the
 
08:03:01.430 --> 08:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
school district in which the child with
 
08:03:03.830 --> 08:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
a disability participating in the efa
 
08:03:06.310 --> 08:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
program enrolled in a public school
 
08:03:09.350 --> 08:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
under again the rsa resides is
 
08:03:12.070 --> 08:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for the provision of faith
 
08:03:12.080 --> 08:03:12.868 align:start position:0%
responsible for the provision of faith
so

08:03:12.868 --> 08:03:12.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:03:15.750 --> 08:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that
 
08:03:18.230 --> 08:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
what's in here is not in there and how
 
08:03:20.468 --> 08:03:20.478 align:start position:0%
you cannot read it if it's part of the
 
08:03:23.350 --> 08:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
application so i am i mean i'm willing
 
08:03:25.430 --> 08:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
to listen but i'm not sure
 
08:03:27.590 --> 08:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
what what it is
 
08:03:27.600 --> 08:03:28.868 align:start position:0%
what what it is
that

08:03:28.868 --> 08:03:28.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:03:31.030 --> 08:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
isn't that you need in addition to
 
08:03:33.750 --> 08:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
what's already being done
 
08:03:33.760 --> 08:03:34.788 align:start position:0%
what's already being done
further

08:03:34.788 --> 08:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
further
 
08:03:37.430 --> 08:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh comments or just yes representative
 
08:03:39.430 --> 08:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
so representative lacus i'm in the
 
08:03:39.440 --> 08:03:40.868 align:start position:0%
so representative lacus i'm in the
application

08:03:40.868 --> 08:03:40.878 align:start position:0%
application
 
08:03:44.548 --> 08:03:44.558 align:start position:0%
and i can't get to any of that unless i
 
08:03:47.190 --> 08:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
create a login
 
08:03:47.200 --> 08:03:49.110 align:start position:0%
create a login
and

08:03:49.110 --> 08:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:03:51.430 --> 08:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
all i did was go to the
 
08:03:53.910 --> 08:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
the department of ed go to the efa
 
08:03:57.110 --> 08:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
accounts go to the application part and
 
08:03:58.868 --> 08:03:58.878 align:start position:0%
click on new
 
08:04:00.548 --> 08:04:00.558 align:start position:0%
families i think it's called new
 
08:04:02.788 --> 08:04:02.798 align:start position:0%
families um
 
08:04:05.030 --> 08:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
and i can't get there i can't i can't
 
08:04:07.350 --> 08:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
get in into that so
 
08:04:09.110 --> 08:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
when you talk about you know how come we
 
08:04:11.190 --> 08:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
haven't seen it how come we haven't read
 
08:04:13.350 --> 08:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
it it's because i can't get in no i
 
08:04:16.230 --> 08:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
didn't ask that i mean i you know
 
08:04:16.240 --> 08:04:17.670 align:start position:0%
didn't ask that i mean i you know
i

08:04:17.670 --> 08:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
08:04:20.230 --> 08:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
well it's in rules but it also
 
08:04:20.240 --> 08:04:21.990 align:start position:0%
well it's in rules but it also
um

08:04:21.990 --> 08:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:04:24.948 --> 08:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
you have to click on the part if you if
 
08:04:26.388 --> 08:04:26.398 align:start position:0%
you're a family
 
08:04:28.388 --> 08:04:28.398 align:start position:0%
and you say yes you have qual a
 
08:04:30.468 --> 08:04:30.478 align:start position:0%
qualified disability
 
08:04:35.350 --> 08:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:36.868 --> 08:04:36.878 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
08:04:38.708 --> 08:04:38.718 align:start position:0%
but i would have to i'd have to have a
 
08:04:41.190 --> 08:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
i'd have to have a log in and get in
 
08:04:43.750 --> 08:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
that far to the process
 
08:04:45.990 --> 08:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to see it well you have to
 
08:04:48.468 --> 08:04:48.478 align:start position:0%
say yes i have a disability yeah and
 
08:04:50.468 --> 08:04:50.478 align:start position:0%
that immediately the app immediately
 
08:04:52.388 --> 08:04:52.398 align:start position:0%
brings up a different section
 
08:04:55.350 --> 08:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
and you would read it there and then you
 
08:04:57.030 --> 08:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
have to click something you have to
 
08:04:59.110 --> 08:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
actually click something that says i
 
08:05:01.270 --> 08:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
have read this requirement
 
08:05:02.628 --> 08:05:02.638 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
08:05:04.548 --> 08:05:04.558 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm saying it's you can't
 
08:05:04.558 --> 08:05:06.310 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm saying it's you can't
possibly

08:05:06.310 --> 08:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
08:05:08.388 --> 08:05:08.398 align:start position:0%
no i i hear what you're saying and i
 
08:05:11.030 --> 08:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
guess if um if i were at the point where
 
08:05:13.430 --> 08:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
i was ready to commit to an efa and
 
08:05:15.750 --> 08:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
actually fill out the application that
 
08:05:17.830 --> 08:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
that would be easy enough
 
08:05:20.948 --> 08:05:20.958 align:start position:0%
um i think representative cornell's bill
 
08:05:24.070 --> 08:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh was meant to or the amendment was
 
08:05:25.270 --> 08:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
meant to
 
08:05:26.468 --> 08:05:26.478 align:start position:0%
sort of have
 
08:05:30.548 --> 08:05:30.558 align:start position:0%
easy access early on that uh
 
08:05:32.230 --> 08:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
you know you didn't have to go looking
 
08:05:33.830 --> 08:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
for and
 
08:05:35.830 --> 08:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
so i you know i think that's something
 
08:05:37.670 --> 08:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
that's worthy of consideration whether
 
08:05:39.190 --> 08:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
or not it
 
08:05:41.190 --> 08:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
should be something that the scholarship
 
08:05:44.070 --> 08:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
organization actually sends out or gives
 
08:05:46.230 --> 08:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
to a family rather than having the
 
08:05:50.230 --> 08:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
family find it on its own actually she
 
08:05:52.070 --> 08:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
to continue on you could have gotten
 
08:05:54.150 --> 08:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
there all you needed to scroll and click
 
08:05:56.468 --> 08:05:56.478 align:start position:0%
yes to qualify you didn't have to be
 
08:05:57.830 --> 08:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
logged in you had didn't have to
 
08:06:00.548 --> 08:06:00.558 align:start position:0%
anything so when you're just curious
 
08:06:02.548 --> 08:06:02.558 align:start position:0%
like you just were
 
08:06:04.468 --> 08:06:04.478 align:start position:0%
you could have gotten to that just by
 
08:06:06.548 --> 08:06:06.558 align:start position:0%
clicking yes that you had a disability
 
08:06:14.548 --> 08:06:14.558 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:16.230 --> 08:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
are there any is there furthest
