00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
on the time being
 
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
10:04 we will get going on our work
 
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
estimates so I think um today and thank
 
00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
you uh Chris for um giving us
 
00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:30.199 align:start position:0%
a an updated
 
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
list that shows not only the business
 
00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:34.759 align:start position:0%
taxes and and dras but also the the ones
 
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
that we went over yesterday um is there
 
00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 align:start position:0%
anything you want to say about this
 
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
before I um start no I just want to make
 
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
sure everybody has it it's dated
 
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
February 11th um as the chair mentioned
 
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
page three is that uh sheet that takes
 
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 align:start position:0%
the dr's information from
 
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
yesterday um for 25 well I see an error
 
00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
already so the first A and B is fiscal
 
00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
25 C n d is 26 and enf are 27
 
00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:06.919 align:start position:0%
okay um so it takes the the numbers that
 
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
were provided for 25 the low and the
 
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
high and then it takes the percentages
 
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
that were offered um in their
 
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
information and applies it to those you
 
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
can see where the meals and rooms
 
00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:19.879 align:start position:0%
there's a gross number so that's the
 
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
400 uh almost $500 million and then from
 
00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
that there's um the municipal transfer
 
00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:27.639 align:start position:0%
and the school building Aid that's
 
00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
removed and the net number is the number
 
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
that would be going to the general fund
 
00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:33.639 align:start position:0%
and the education trust fund so when
 
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
you're doing your estimate related to
 
00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
that um you want to focus on the gross
 
00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
number and then once you get that I will
 
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
do a calculation
 
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
um that will make the adjustment and and
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
then let you know what the final number
 
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
is um the other thing is interest in
 
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
dividends you'll see that the number is
 
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
134 for fiscal year 25 in both the A and
 
00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:58.280 align:start position:0%
the B uh columns the commissioner
 
00:07:59.950 --> 00:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned that to you yesterday that she
 
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
thinks that's what the number is and
 
00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:04.759 align:start position:0%
then in um fiscal year 26 the amount
 
00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:05.879 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
8.7 um and that and that's just due to
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
the timing of a fiscal year versus a tax
 
00:08:13.469 --> 00:08:13.479 align:start position:0%
year being completed in in the
 
00:08:13.479 --> 00:08:15.309 align:start position:0%
year being completed in in the
extensions

00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
extensions
 
00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:18.039 align:start position:0%
right and then the last uh note was just
 
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
with the real estate transfer again you
 
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
do a gross number and we deduct $5
 
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:24.280 align:start position:0%
million as um from that that gets
 
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:26.599 align:start position:0%
transferred to the affordable housing
 
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
Fund in the body of the um
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet you know Pages four to the
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
end you'll find shaded columns those are
 
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
the columns that you agreed to yesterday
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
columns that are in white are the
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
columns that you're going to work on
 
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
today if there's any changes or errors
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
in the Shaded columns let me know if for
 
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
somehow I that fingered a number and
 
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
didn't get it correct and you just
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
notied that please please let me know
 
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
that um the other thing that I did
 
00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
provide you today is a print out of an
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
email I forwarded you the email as well
 
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
but it was to the insurance department
 
00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519 align:start position:0%
it's their response to the two questions
 
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
I posed to them yesterday one was that
 
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
they um factor in the the
 
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
disasters around the the country and
 
00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
World in terms of their premiums and
 
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
were they satisfied with their um
 
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
estimates and so they gave you about a
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
page of of dialogue related to that the
 
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
short answer is yes and yes to both of
 
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
those questions right and I'm
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
comfortable with their response but
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative ORS isn't here for me to
 
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:37.949 --> 00:09:37.959 align:start position:0%
let's let's do what we did yesterday for
 
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
a little while anyhow work work
 
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:49.959 align:start position:0%
um well actually let's see where's the
 
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
insurance page two or page four page
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
four yeah yeah let's go to page four
 
00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
okay so and I forget who had those
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
questions but um the you had them okay
 
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
so you're okay now okay
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
um so then let's look at column F line
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
1503 line 16 column
 
00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.350 align:start position:0%
1503 line 16 column
F

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
F
 
00:10:59.550 --> 00:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%

so I mean taking that into account we
 
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
will not raise the estimate be my
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
impression uh or my thought um
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%

00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
see let's uh look at uh utility property
 
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:03.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
yeah okay this is the the first one
 
00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
we're addressing now where
 
00:14:11.749 --> 00:14:11.759 align:start position:0%
we have highs and high and lows that are
 
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
not the same or not super close to each
 
00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.710 align:start position:0%
not the same or not super close to each
other

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
um any comments on utility property tax
 
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.990 align:start position:0%
um any comments on utility property tax
represent

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
elme thank you um
 
00:14:32.829 --> 00:14:32.839 align:start position:0%
the utility property tax is on it's a
 
00:14:36.269 --> 00:14:36.279 align:start position:0%
property tax it's not on the revenues of
 
00:14:36.279 --> 00:14:37.710 align:start position:0%
property tax it's not on the revenues of
those

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:37.720 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:40.839 align:start position:0%
organizations uh
 
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
and we are likely to see
 
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
some reduction in those properties from
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
the side of renewable energy given
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
what's going on nationally and uh and in
 
00:15:01.949 --> 00:15:01.959 align:start position:0%
in the St
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
committee um and I don't see any reason
 
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
why the the other structures that bring
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
oil and gas into our state uh are going
 
00:15:18.189 --> 00:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
to need more
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so I don't
 
00:15:21.199 --> 00:15:23.069 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so I don't
really

00:15:23.069 --> 00:15:23.079 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
understand um an increase
 
00:15:31.949 --> 00:15:31.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
um a assessment Bureau inside the Dr
 
00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
which doesn't ever talk to
 
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
us or to anybody else as far as I can
 
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
tell and
 
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
um maybe we could get an explanation out
 
00:15:47.199 --> 00:15:49.990 align:start position:0%
um maybe we could get an explanation out
of

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.749 --> 00:15:54.759 align:start position:0%
them out of Dr yeah out out of out of
 
00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
that part of
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
Dr it's kind of a
 
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
separate body inside every time I ask if
 
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:07.240 align:start position:0%
we could get some help from them
 
00:16:12.309 --> 00:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
on they sort of refer us to the top
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
assessor so uh what is your so what is
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
your actual what is the specific
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
question well uh they're increasing the
 
00:16:24.749 --> 00:16:24.759 align:start position:0%
value at the low level even I think oh
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
no no it's at uh the cafer is coming in
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
at 46.8 so um so they are taking it
 
00:16:39.389 --> 00:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
down um yeah and they are actually their
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
High estimate is
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
below so it's probably a reflection
 
00:16:46.829 --> 00:16:46.839 align:start position:0%
reflection of reality at this point it
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
seems like they're taking that into
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
account yeah yeah so I I take that back
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
sorry wasn't looking at the cafer all
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
right uh other
 
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
comments okay how about um suggestions
 
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
on what we've got FY 25 obviously line
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
11 line 16 and line 21 to fill in so U
 
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
this is not as simple as before where we
 
00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:17.799 align:start position:0%
just uh round um so how do people feel
 
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
about this any any thoughts on what
 
00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
these numbers should be for 25 26 27
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
YY the the bureau and Dr um it's been
 
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
pretty accurate when they uh presented
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
in the uh Science and Technology uh
 
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
group last year that's going to be
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
uh the figures for the fixed items the
 
00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
property that is uh this this body
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
worked on uh uh PAB bramy uh chaired a
 
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
couple of different commit committees to
 
00:17:59.950 --> 00:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
set the prices for the C cables the
 
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
conduits the the physical stuff that
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
gets power into your house not the
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
electrons but the the physical stuff
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
that may be subject to some
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
modifications with the the steel tariffs
 
00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
that have been put on uh the aluminum uh
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
tariff that's put on because a lot of
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
the cable is not steel it's aluminum or
 
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
not the transmission lines are aluminum
 
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
but nevertheless I think that there may
 
00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
be a a a shortterm
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
impact over the budget years two years
 
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
but for our
 
00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
purposes I kind of believe that these
 
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
numbers are pretty
 
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
moderate concern Contin uh concerning
 
00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
the the fluctuations that could take
 
00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
place that is they
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
reflect a
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
median activity or valuation rather than
 
00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.590 align:start position:0%
median activity or valuation rather than
massive

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
massive
 
00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:03.799 align:start position:0%
swings in addition the consumption of
 
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
energy in the United States in New
 
00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
huge uh
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
so the dollar value coming in is only
 
00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
going to go up but for budgeting
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
purposes I think we should probably stay
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
close to those provided by uh
 
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
Dr uh I think they've got a good handle
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
on okay where it's going to be thank you
 
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
well that's that's so just to finalize
 
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:35.720 align:start position:0%
that thought um you you think those are
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
pretty good where it's a high and a low
 
00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:41.240 align:start position:0%
so where do you personally feel like it
 
00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
should end
 
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
up 45 uh average it two yeah yeah 452
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
three somewhere in there okay uh
 
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth yes that's
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
what I had 45 micro microphone sorry 452
 
00:19:59.710 --> 00:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
452 and that's the average of those two
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
numbers corre okay oh yes I see that now
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
452 okay any other thoughts or everyone
 
00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
good with
 
00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:11.559 align:start position:0%
452 question Mr chairman can the Dr just
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
give us maybe a number on the
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
depreciation every year
 
00:20:19.149 --> 00:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
that these companies utilities go
 
00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
through do you have
 
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
any depreciation numbers there on their
 
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
property the
 
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
property well let me just ask this I
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
mean when an assessor
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
assessor assesses a property they don't
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
take depreciation into
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
account so I'm not sure that that
 
00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
matters yes okay representative tney
 
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
microphone please yes they do take into
 
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
account the age of a property uh if your
 
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
house is assessed and you've got a brand
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
new one out it's going to have uh one
 
00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
rate and then uh one of the columns they
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
use is age of the property uh and that
 
00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
can be a plus or a minus depending
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
upon just how how good the property is
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
okay and you know how fancy and all that
 
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
sort of stuff but yeah age does get
 
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
taken into account on it okay so age
 
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
gets taken into account however we're
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
talking about the next two years I mean
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
how big a change that's not going to be
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
big right there's there's not much of a
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
a change there so I I'm not sure it
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
makes sense for Dr to look at that
 
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
uh yes represent
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
opal I'm just I'm just trying to
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
understand ba based on listening to
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
representative Aly and I I think I agree
 
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
there's there's not going to be a whole
 
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
influx of infrastructure in the next two
 
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
years um if if the act for says
 
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.029 align:start position:0%
years um if if the act for says
467

00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
467
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
now um or at least that's projection for
 
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
for fiscal
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
24 what is the what are the fact factors
 
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
think other than just trying to be
 
00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:04.919 align:start position:0%
conservative that would reduce that
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
amount in fiscal 25 to the 45 the
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
average of the of the high and low
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
estimates just it's it's yeah it's um we
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
we haven't found that crystal ball so
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
yeah I know if it seems like there's a
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
little bit of guesswork there is but
 
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
it's based it's it's it's based on our
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
best thoughts about where we see things
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
heading I mean even if there is infrastr
 
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
I mean you could debate whether
 
00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is going to decrease or
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
increase or where it's going to end up
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
but but even in that regard these are
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
these are big uh companies they're slow
 
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
moving sort of things so I don't think
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to see anything too
 
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
dramatic which is which is what I'm
 
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
wondering Mr chair that um you know
 
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
based on based on all of those factors
 
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
and what I understand I mean I'd be
 
00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
comfortable with sort of going with the
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
with the a for number for all three
 
00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
years and I I figure that would probably
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
put us in a sweet spot but that's just
 
00:23:03.789 --> 00:23:03.799 align:start position:0%
one man's
 
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:07.480 align:start position:0%
opinion that's okay um he well he he's
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
saying so the Acer number on on line
 
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
three is
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
46.7 uh and he's saying he's comfortable
 
00:23:17.549 --> 00:23:17.559 align:start position:0%
with that number but that number I'll
 
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
point out is higher than than uh
 
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
everything except the high of FY
 
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
27er representative YY
 
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I I understand what AC yeah well
 
00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
yes they Chang the name and we don't
 
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
change it yeah the
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh spiking revenue from uh this uh from
 
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
utilities property tax took place when
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh the the major companies decided that
 
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
they were going to upgrade their um
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
cable sizes from X kilow to x squ
 
00:23:58.830 --> 00:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
kilow uh you saw all the B building that
 
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
was taking place off the highways and
 
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
you know wood going down on the wetlands
 
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
as they went out and worked on the
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
towers and all that stuff
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
um that's almost all done but almost not
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
quite done so there's going to be some
 
00:24:17.549 --> 00:24:17.559 align:start position:0%
growth yes but it's going to be less
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
growth than has taken place in the past
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
cers is a past react is a reactive
 
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
number as opposed to a proactive number
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
in we're trying to find proactive
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
numbers which is virtually impossible
 
00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
but uh we get pretty close I think that
 
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be considered as well there may
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
be depending upon legislation passed a a
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
growth in the property tax offset by
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
swep taxes uh if we take the uh if the
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
Science and Technology bill passes out
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh but that's something we can't really
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
consider yeah representative Brier
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know I'm I'm looking at these
 
00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:03.640 align:start position:0%
and uh I think we just take the
 
00:25:06.909 --> 00:25:06.919 align:start position:0%
average sorry I I think we should just
 
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
take the average between the two numbers
 
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
represent of Southworth um I come up
 
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.630 align:start position:0%
represent of Southworth um I come up
with

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
459 for
 
00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
2026 uh no we're um okay I came up with
 
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
464 the average oh I'm sorry I'm ahead
 
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
I'm at 2026 I already we haven't
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
confirmed Med
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
2025 but U is it was that an average
 
00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
representative forth okay uh
 
00:25:37.149 --> 00:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
representative elme thank you I'm sorry
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
did you have a followup well no my only
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
comment is you got a high and a low and
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
we really you know to be conservative I
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
just take the average between the two
 
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:48.559 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh I'm sorry
 
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
representative you're too close I I
 
00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919 align:start position:0%
don't notice Abol be anyway yeah I just
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
want to point out there's an ongoing
 
00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
program to hard of the infrastructure in
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
the in the United States all these large
 
00:26:02.669 --> 00:26:02.679 align:start position:0%
poles that you see being replaced that's
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
going to continue as a matter of public
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
policy to harden the
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure represent elme thank you
 
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
um if I remember correctly and the Dr
 
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
needs to tell me uh we they go out and
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
April the
 
00:26:28.919 --> 00:26:30.870 align:start position:0%
April the
assessment

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:36.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
round representative Al I'm not sure
 
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
about the April but we do assess these
 
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
properties um Dr does the assessments
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
for these properties I couldn't hear
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
most of that I'm sorry I said I'm not
 
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
sure about the April but we do Dr does
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
the assessments for these properties you
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
vary it yes between different months I
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not certain the timing of the yeah
 
00:27:00.269 --> 00:27:00.279 align:start position:0%
of the appraisals but it they are done
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
by Dr on a regular basis yeah well what
 
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
I'm getting at is if they take as we do
 
00:27:12.669 --> 00:27:12.679 align:start position:0%
for property taxes an April assessment
 
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
number uh and we've had a fair amount of
 
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
inflation since then in in a lot of
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
things on are we looking at the in the
 
00:27:29.389 --> 00:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
low estimate as lower than what it would
 
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
actually be this year or so the the low
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
estimate uses the first seven months of
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
actual revenue and then adds plan to it
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
so I don't think that the uh impact that
 
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
you're looking for would necessarily be
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
in these estimated numbers
 
00:27:52.389 --> 00:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
ah okay so it would be pretty much up to
 
00:27:59.310 --> 00:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
date for 25 correct yeah okay okay
 
00:28:04.509 --> 00:28:04.519 align:start position:0%
um all right so on um so on 2025 it
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
sounds like the the rough consensus here
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
is to go with an average which would be
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
what was it
 
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.669 align:start position:0%
what was it
45.2

00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
45.2
 
00:28:11.679 --> 00:28:13.509 align:start position:0%
45.2
yes

00:28:13.509 --> 00:28:13.519 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
anyone okay all right FY 26 I know uh
 
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
Representatives oh wait a minute let
 
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.310 align:start position:0%
Representatives oh wait a minute let
me

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh what what okay I'm wait until I call
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
on you because uh we we need organized
 
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
chaos here um all right representative
 
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
Southworth you had I had
 
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
459 459 which was an average and then
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
the next one is
 
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
466 the last one which is also an
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
average all right so you're an advocate
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
of average um of taking the average not
 
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
advocate of average and then what
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative um Ford did you
 
00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
have something you wanted to say you
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
agree with the the average okay uh
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
represent elme no oh sorry all right so
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
in general people are saying okay let's
 
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
just go the average for 40 for 26 as
 
00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
well and I would assume 27 same thing
 
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
average anyone have a huge problem with
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seem like it all right so
 
00:29:19.389 --> 00:29:19.399 align:start position:0%
what are those numbers again the average
 
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
on 26 is what
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
459 okay and the average on 27 47
 
00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:31.519 align:start position:0%
66 does anyone else confirm that so we
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
make sure okay yeah it was in my grace
 
00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:36.519 align:start position:0%
house he's he's an educator he knows
 
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
what he's oh I know he knows what he's
 
00:29:39.389 --> 00:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
doing I just want to make sure we don't
 
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
you know make a
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
mistake um okay would someone like to
 
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
make a motion to accept these numbers
 
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
could you give us the numbers again
 
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
please Mr chairman we're talking on uh
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
page six column
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
o line 11 45 thou um well not 45 5,000

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
million okay uh representative attorney
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
makes a motion to accept those numbers
 
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
do I have a second second second all
 
00:30:30.269 --> 00:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
any further discussion seeing none all
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
in favor please raise your hand of these
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
numbers okay any opposed okay that's
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
unanimous and I believe we now have 16
 
00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:45.190 align:start position:0%
unanimous and I believe we now have 16
people

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
here 13 14 15 oh wa I just counted 17
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
wait what is it oh he showed
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
17 okay thank
 
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
you all right so that concludes utility
 
00:31:03.919 --> 00:31:05.110 align:start position:0%
you all right so that concludes utility
property

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%

00:31:24.669 --> 00:31:24.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
now okay so we are done with page 6
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
through 10 let's see what we have on
 
00:31:31.679 --> 00:31:33.669 align:start position:0%
through 10 let's see what we have on
page

00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
five page five uh let's go to uh real
 
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
H thoughts on column H representative
 
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
Southworth thank you um I was able to
 
00:31:58.029 --> 00:31:58.039 align:start position:0%
listen to the streaming for um r
 
00:32:00.509 --> 00:32:00.519 align:start position:0%
presentation okay and it almost exactly
 
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
mirrored um our Register of Deeds
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
presentation that I just heard from
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
straford County okay so I know um she
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
they did contact the counties of course
 
00:32:12.509 --> 00:32:12.519 align:start position:0%
to develop this but it was almost word
 
00:32:15.549 --> 00:32:15.559 align:start position:0%
for word what our Register of Deeds said
 
00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039 align:start position:0%
okay again for what you can estimate
 
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
okay and therefore your conclusion so
 
00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
that made me confident of in these R
 
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
numbers and again I would maintain that
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
it's wise with that having more
 
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge in a way than us to go with
 
00:32:33.669 --> 00:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
the middle to go with the average okay I
 
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
am pleased that it's bouncing
 
00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
back yes or projected to
 
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
yeah it it is you're right it is
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
bouncing back a little bit yes uh other
 
00:32:45.519 --> 00:32:50.070 align:start position:0%
bouncing back a little bit yes uh other
thoughts

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.789 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:32:51.789 --> 00:32:51.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:32:51.799 --> 00:32:53.389 align:start position:0%
representative
Aly

00:32:53.389 --> 00:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
Aly
 
00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:58.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I think I agree with that it's
 
00:33:00.629 --> 00:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
bouncing back way too slowly for what we
 
00:33:05.629 --> 00:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
need but but that seems given all of the
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
difficulty it's going to be even worse
 
00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
difficulty of getting Timber and and
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
other inputs they're going to keep going
 
00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
are yeah well the beauty of this is we
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
don't know what um what's going to
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
happen um the timber may go up but it
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
may it may reverse itself too depending
 
00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
on how policies change over the course
 
00:33:36.909 --> 00:33:36.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
well okay uh did I see someone else
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
representative ORS so uh thank you Mr
 
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
chairman I agree with the idea of going
 
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:49.559 align:start position:0%
with the averages for 25 and 26 but 27 I
 
00:33:51.549 --> 00:33:51.559 align:start position:0%
think we ought to be closer to the high
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
number I believe that we're going to see
 
00:33:56.629 --> 00:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
fuel prices come down interest rates
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
come down
 
00:34:00.029 --> 00:34:00.039 align:start position:0%
and we are going to we're going to see
 
00:34:02.669 --> 00:34:02.679 align:start position:0%
the Golden Age of America in a short
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
period of time and I I think that these
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
rebound um representative Ying oh to
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
representing War's Point
 
00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:20.750 align:start position:0%
representing War's Point
yes

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
maybe we're in the process of setting
 
00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
some general goals I I'm confident that
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
what will um what you suggest uh there's
 
00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
a strong possibility probability that
 
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
will take effect but I think we need to
 
00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
look at where we are now and get a
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
better sense as to what is happening for
 
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
the short term we're only dealing with a
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
twoyear budget and we're giving some
 
00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:54.599 align:start position:0%
approximations out there
 
00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
um we've got a lot of housing laws
 
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
that are coming
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
through some of those are
 
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
bipartisan some of them aren't on the
 
00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
national scale the prime rate is subject
 
00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
of messing right now it could be up it
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
could be down who knows there's when
 
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
you're engaged in arguing with people in
 
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
negotiations sometimes it becomes you
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
got to just say okay what's this and not
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
worry about
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
that looking forward I would I would
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
think we need to probably be a little
 
00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.790 align:start position:0%
think we need to probably be a little
more

00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh cautious at this
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
I I think one of the one of the most
 
00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
important things that uh Rees of Y just
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
said that I resonated with me as the
 
00:35:56.309 --> 00:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
difference between two years and four
 
00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
years like we can believe believe that
 
00:35:59.550 --> 00:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
you know in four years everyone has a
 
00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
belief on what will be the result in
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
four years but in two years probably
 
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
again not that much is changing and
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of challenges because even
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
if lumber prices come down let's say the
 
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
tariffs work in a way that actually
 
00:36:16.309 --> 00:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
brings lumber prices down through
 
00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
because through policy changes that are
 
00:36:20.109 --> 00:36:20.119 align:start position:0%
affected by that the issue still is
 
00:36:21.309 --> 00:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people that are in
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
housing that they got into at three and
 
00:36:26.349 --> 00:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
four per. and those people aren't
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh sell their house and go into some if
 
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
the interest rates are still 6% or
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
higher not going to make the move and so
 
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
um it's still makes the housing market
 
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
difficult um
 
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
so yeah so factors from from
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
availability of lumber to interest rates
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
to people willing to put their homes on
 
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
there's so many variables that I would
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
say um I personally think the average is
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
probably where we want to be right now
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
but other thoughts representative
 
00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
yeah to follow up on your point I think
 
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
the biggest Factor on all these various
 
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
unknowns is the interest rate factor and
 
00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
that's primarily driven by the federal
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
budget unfortunately we don't have
 
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
regular order in the federal budget it's
 
00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
all continuing resolutions so I don't
 
00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
expect any budget to come out of
 
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
Washington which would mean it's up to
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
the Federal Reserve to determine
 
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
interest rates and that depends on the
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
money supply as represented all likes to
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
M2 so my guess is that in the forecast
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
that I read is that I don't see any big
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
changes in the federal deficit which is
 
00:37:35.069 --> 00:37:35.079 align:start position:0%
still running about two trillion and
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
consequent they hav don't see any big
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
change in interest rates coming over the
 
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
next two years so I would assume things
 
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
would be relatively stable and not a big
 
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
increase until
 
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
2026 maybe
 
00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
thoughts oh
 
00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
yes uh right now there's a bill and I
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
know it's future but there's a bill for
 
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
us to tax carbon in the
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
trees if that passes that will we will
 
00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:12.079 align:start position:0%
be the first state that will be taxing
 
00:38:13.309 --> 00:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
carbon in the
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
trees uh when Foresters don't cut if it
 
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass lumber prices aren't coming
 
00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
down because those properties are locked
 
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
up in the case of the one up north until
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be harvesting much
 
00:38:35.309 --> 00:38:35.319 align:start position:0%
Lumber out of there at all if any yeah
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's um I it's probably unlikely
 
00:38:40.589 --> 00:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
something like that would pass I I think
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
last year there was a bill similar with
 
00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.309 align:start position:0%
last year there was a bill similar with
carbon

00:38:44.309 --> 00:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
carbon
 
00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh I don't I haven't studied that bill I
 
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
don't know how similar it is but I think
 
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
the odds of it passing are slim um and
 
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
and to your point we do need to stick
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
with what what is the current law right
 
00:38:59.230 --> 00:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
now as we make these estimates any other
 
00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
thoughts okay so is the consensus go
 
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
with the averages anyone violently
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
against that
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
idea okay so then let's go with the
 
00:39:14.309 --> 00:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
averages uh real estate uh transfer line
 
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
11 what's the average of that has anyone
 
00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.589 align:start position:0%
11 what's the average of that has anyone
calculated

00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
calculated
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
27 okay so so we have our numbers now FY
 
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.140 align:start position:0%
27 okay so so we have our numbers now FY
25

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:45.150 align:start position:0%

Aly any last minute
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
thoughts seeing none all in favor of
 
00:40:14.349 --> 00:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
those estimates please raise your
 
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
hand anyone
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
opposed no opposed so again that's I
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
don't think anyone left to came in so 17
 
00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.510 align:start position:0%
don't think anyone left to came in so 17
to

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay the only page that has items that
 
00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
now what that
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
yeah all right so page four let's start
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
with um column
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh thoughts on uh the communications tax
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
is one that is fairly
 
00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
U stable it has uh decreased a little
 
00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:17.720 align:start position:0%
bit in the in the past uh year or two
 
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
um and the agency looks like they're
 
00:41:23.309 --> 00:41:23.319 align:start position:0%
keeping the high at 30 where it had
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
traditionally been but they are seeing
 
00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:28.839 align:start position:0%
degradation in that and that's why you
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
see the low on 25 26 27 the low is
 
00:41:34.589 --> 00:41:34.599 align:start position:0%
continually going down because uh I
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
think as they described there's more and
 
00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:43.160 align:start position:0%
more uh data being um going through
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
um what was it cell phones texting um
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
and away from landlines is data yeah um
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay so thoughts representative
 
00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:55.079 align:start position:0%
Southworth I'm sorry representative
 
00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
Bolton had his light on first
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
um I think I would stay um more closely
 
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
to the lower
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
number yeah representative Southworth
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
I'm still uh fine with the averages
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
because it's barely difference actually
 
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
than until I mean barely gaps here yeah
 
00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.510 align:start position:0%
than until I mean barely gaps here yeah
representative

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:23.359 --> 00:42:24.870 align:start position:0%
 
a

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
okay so uh so we had two people speak
 
00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
one said go with the low one said
 
00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
average so I need more
 
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
thoughts representative elme a average
 
00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.109 align:start position:0%
thoughts representative elme a average
representative

00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
average okay my question would be those
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
who want the
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
average uh we see a degradation year
 
00:42:55.309 --> 00:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
after year so why would we um go with
 
00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
the average that's my question the
 
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
average since the lower number is going
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
down the average is going to go down
 
00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.270 align:start position:0%
down the average is going to go down
also

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
ditto okay the a I just looked at the
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
AER number the AER is 30.5 which is
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
actually above the high so uh gives us a
 
00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:18.839 align:start position:0%
safety the average might make sense uh
 
00:43:20.829 --> 00:43:20.839 align:start position:0%
representative Y no that's I was just
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
going to point that out
 
00:43:26.069 --> 00:43:26.079 align:start position:0%
okay all right yeah representative home
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm kind of leaning toward the low
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
side I see that because if you look at
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
the landline companies they're all
 
00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
taking away the copper that's going to
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
be a VIP even though it's still going to
 
00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
be from a landline company I just see
 
00:43:38.319 --> 00:43:39.270 align:start position:0%
be from a landline company I just see
the

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure of this
 
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
uh traditional landline tax uh declining
 
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
fairly sharply I believe so I'm declin
 
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
to go with the low numbers with the data
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
moving to other
 
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
methods well I I ordinarily would have
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
agreed with that until I looked at the
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
Acer number again and that that being
 
00:43:59.599 --> 00:44:01.109 align:start position:0%
Acer number again and that that being
30.

00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
30.
 
00:44:04.109 --> 00:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
uh6 which is above the 30 but I I don't
 
00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
discount what you're saying either it's
 
00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:07.839 align:start position:0%
it's a again we don't have we don't have
 
00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
a crystal ball it's we're trying to do
 
00:44:12.109 --> 00:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
our best uh to figure this
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
that um I'm fine with making a motion
 
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
just make see how it so you make a
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
motion to put your
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
microphone I make a motion to use the
 
00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
averages for the communications tax do I
 
00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
okay any further
 
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
discussion anyone thinks the average is
 
00:44:53.549 --> 00:44:53.559 align:start position:0%
an issue represent Al me a isue on the
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
first microphone please average is an
 
00:44:59.390 --> 00:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
issue on the first one I suggest that we
 
00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
0.5 that is 20
 
00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.820 align:start position:0%
0.5 that is 20
20

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:11.830 align:start position:0%
20
 
00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:16.109 align:start position:0%

[Music]

00:45:16.109 --> 00:45:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
29.5 uh rather than
 
00:45:27.309 --> 00:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
all right that's a slight change do you
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
want to rephrase your motion to round
 
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
down on the average on fy2 so I make a
 
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
motion to use the average and round down
 
00:45:41.349 --> 00:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
um if it's 0.5 which goes along with
 
00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
these people okay nice compromise okay
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
29.5 correct uh
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
line 16 is 29.1 yes
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
and line 21 is what's the average of
 
00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
that that makes sense
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
okay all right further discussion on
 
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
that seeing none all in favor of those
 
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
numbers for the Communication Service
 
00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
tax raise your
 
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
hand anyone
 
00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.910 align:start position:0%
hand anyone
opposed

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
okay yes and just as a reminder to the
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
members this these numbers are subject
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
it well up until I mean just to clarify
 
00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:39.309 align:start position:0%
it well up until I mean just to clarify
that

00:46:39.309 --> 00:46:39.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:43.720 align:start position:0%
statement uh there up until the time
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
that we actually have a resolution which
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
will include all these numbers uh we
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
will vote on the resolution once we vote
 
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
on that that's the resolution now
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative ery might also be
 
00:46:57.870 --> 00:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
alluding to the fact that um after the
 
00:46:59.549 --> 00:46:59.559 align:start position:0%
resolution is brought before the house
 
00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:02.599 align:start position:0%
and voted on if we see something really
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
changing drastically we can uh pull that
 
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:07.480 align:start position:0%
resolution off the T and by the way the
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
process is to table that resolution we
 
00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
would then pull it off the table uh
 
00:47:14.349 --> 00:47:14.359 align:start position:0%
modify it with an amendment if
 
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
it's uh this year I believe uh then we
 
00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
can modify with an amendment put it back
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
on the table uh if it's next year that
 
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
we see something changing drastically we
 
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
have a new resolution with those numbers
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
and that gets put on the table um
 
00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
represent El me yes and and after that
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
first one that first one goes into the
 
00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:42.680 align:start position:0%
budget it's in stone but on after that
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh modifying the amendment or putting in
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
a new one on is a signal to the
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
legislature and the and the executive
 
00:47:56.349 --> 00:47:56.359 align:start position:0%
that things have changed enough that we
 
00:47:59.309 --> 00:47:59.319 align:start position:0%
need to think about modifying but it is
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
just a signal yeah yeah thank
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
you okay with that uh correct me if I'm
 
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
anyone thinks I'm wrong but I believe
 
00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:10.470 align:start position:0%
anyone thinks I'm wrong but I believe
the

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
only I'm saying only but the most
 
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
difficult are coming The Columns we have
 
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
left are column a b c and
 
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
e e might well e might be yeah E is easy
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
but I'm my point is we have a b c and e
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
left um okay what go to the uh
 
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
last well tobacco might not be too bad
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
but the last easy one interest and
 
00:48:35.069 --> 00:48:35.079 align:start position:0%
dividends column
 
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
e um we obviously know that interest in
 
00:48:40.109 --> 00:48:40.119 align:start position:0%
dividends is going away and that's why
 
00:48:44.109 --> 00:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
we see a a rapid decline there
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
2025 we still will see money coming in
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
from the 2024 tax returns and that's why
 
00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:54.200 align:start position:0%
that number is still fairly
 
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
High okay thoughts on interest in
 
00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
dividend and what we believe the number
 
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
should be representative Southworth is
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
quick on the button um full disclosure I
 
00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
just paid
 
00:49:08.589 --> 00:49:08.599 align:start position:0%
$13 $13 for indd indd I just I just
 
00:49:08.599 --> 00:49:09.549 align:start position:0%
$13 $13 for indd indd I just I just
mailed

00:49:09.549 --> 00:49:09.559 align:start position:0%
mailed
 
00:49:13.789 --> 00:49:13.799 align:start position:0%
it anyway um I think we should accept
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
numbers that's getting I wanted a couple
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
left okay so right but there's no
 
00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
average here by accepting their numbers
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
well I guess you could still say it's
 
00:49:31.349 --> 00:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
the average the average is 134.5 and
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
8.7 um anyone anyone else feel that
 
00:49:37.789 --> 00:49:37.799 align:start position:0%
there's some some other number that
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
should happen here I mean I think as far
 
00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
as this in my mind Dr is the one
 
00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:45.559 align:start position:0%
analyzing this I don't think we have
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
information above and beyond what they
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
have cash flow yeah so Mr chairman yes
 
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
uh I'll agree with their numbers but I
 
00:49:56.349 --> 00:49:56.359 align:start position:0%
do not like the policy that we're going
 
00:49:56.359 --> 00:49:57.589 align:start position:0%
do not like the policy that we're going
through

00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
okay on this issue understood current
 
00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
law um is all we're dealing
 
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
with but it's good to know your opinion
 
00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
to representative
 
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
shamber okay um so would someone like to
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
make a motion to accept these
 
00:50:18.589 --> 00:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
numbers representative uh Aly seconded
 
00:50:20.829 --> 00:50:20.839 align:start position:0%
by representative
 
00:50:20.839 --> 00:50:23.430 align:start position:0%
by representative
ORS

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
ORS
 
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
ORS you oh yeah
 
00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:28.630 align:start position:0%
ORS you oh yeah
that

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
sound El me yeah
 
00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
um um so the the motion is to accept
 
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
these numbers in column e as presented
 
00:50:44.789 --> 00:50:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
hand all
 
00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:50.200 align:start position:0%
opposed uh seeing none the vote is uh no
 
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
170 okay
 
00:50:59.470 --> 00:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
all right we now have three left to do
 
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
column A B and C business taxes meals
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
and rooms and
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
tobacco and um I think we'll continue
 
00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:09.910 align:start position:0%
tobacco and um I think we'll continue
working

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:13.640 align:start position:0%
uh from the uh right to left so column C
 
00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:14.589 align:start position:0%
uh from the uh right to left so column C
is

00:51:14.589 --> 00:51:14.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
next uh tobacco thoughts on the tobacco
 
00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
representative salw worth again I'm glad
 
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
to make a motion to use the averages I
 
00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
think they've been studying this a long
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
time and watching the trends and I think
 
00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:58.589 align:start position:0%
 
from

00:51:58.589 --> 00:51:58.599 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
Cy however using the averages in the
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
last term resulted in
 
00:52:06.829 --> 00:52:06.839 align:start position:0%
25 to the
 
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
negative maybe closer to the lower end
 
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
may be appropriate um the health
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
education in high schools seems to be
 
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
going strong although I that may be
 
00:52:23.109 --> 00:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
countered by the stupidity of adding
 
00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:25.559 align:start position:0%
taxes that our Southern neighbor is
 
00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.270 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
maybe just under the averages closer to
 
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
the low side
 
00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:42.680 align:start position:0%
because of the competing effects of
 
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
increased sales from out of state but
 
00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:49.240 align:start position:0%
increased reduction in smoking because
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's becoming less socially
 
00:52:58.349 --> 00:52:58.359 align:start position:0%
acceptable uh even to older folks but
 
00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
representative uh Southworth would um it
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
work for you to take 0 five off the
 
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
average yeah thank
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
you people with calculators we can take
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
0 five off the average representative
 
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
home yeah support taking it down a bit
 
00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
where I live at in N you go across the
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
border of tsoro and there's the weed
 
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
shops that are just packed with license
 
00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
plates so I just see the trend from The
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.390 align:start position:0%
 
represent

00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
viy why would you put license plates in
 
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:40.660 align:start position:0%
shop any other any other uh useful
 
00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:45.430 align:start position:0%
shop any other any other uh useful
[Laughter]

00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
comments okay uh so I just point out
 
00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
that I go to too at a restaurant down
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
there to save the room and meal
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
Stacks saying meals and rooms okay
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
so someone with a calculator can you
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
0.5 get
 
00:54:09.069 --> 00:54:09.079 align:start position:0%
183.0 five and if we're taking five off
 
00:54:11.549 --> 00:54:11.559 align:start position:0%
I guess it would be 183
 
00:54:11.559 --> 00:54:16.710 align:start position:0%
I guess it would be 183
1835

00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
18 yeah yeah so it's
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
18395 is the exact average so if you
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
take 0. five off
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
183.2 or 18 okay
 
00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
yes or if you take the 0. five off first
 
00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
you simply add 1.1 to the low number and
 
00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
1837 what how you got higher that that
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
brought it
 
00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
higher the difference between the two is
 
00:54:59.950 --> 00:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
2.7 if you take the 05 off first you're
 
00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
down to 2.2 and then that's an easy
 
00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
number to divide in half 1.1
 
00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
Bingo does it work if you're standing on
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:19.789 --> 00:55:19.799 align:start position:0%
does all I don't know I'm sticking with
 
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
the traditional add the two numbers
 
00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
together and divide by
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
two I kind of like that idea I'm kind of
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
an oldfashioned guy
 
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
I do too but if they're giving but I was
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:35.960 align:start position:0%
know P Mass doesn't apply
 
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.470 align:start position:0%
 
ma

00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
ma
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
um I like one I like 183.0
 
00:55:48.309 --> 00:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
representative El me yes I would just
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
suggest if we're trying to go lower that
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
whichever of those two numbers is lower
 
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
yeah the number which would be
 
00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:59.670 align:start position:0%
yeah the number which would be
183.0

00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
183.0
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
yes okay I see a lot of n rep Tyne is
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
rep tyrany an accountant or math
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
major we can we can take that up later
 
00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
no I thought so you're killing me okay
 
00:56:14.109 --> 00:56:14.119 align:start position:0%
uh FY
 
00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
26 um the what where what do those
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
numbers come out averaging minus .5 did
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:42.109 --> 00:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
176.000 after you deduct the half yeah
 
00:56:44.349 --> 00:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
and the last one oh did you have a
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
comment on yeah
 
00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:53.319 align:start position:0%
um we're not supposed to consider
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
pending legislation but maybe that
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
number should be just a couple higher
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
because of pending legislation in
 
00:57:04.109 --> 00:57:04.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts we no no there's no
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
guarantee that that'll come through uh
 
00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
and the last one what's the average
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
there I gave
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
174 oh I didn't take off the half point
 
00:57:13.599 --> 00:57:15.150 align:start position:0%
174 oh I didn't take off the half point
so

00:57:15.150 --> 00:57:15.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
1735 1735 confirm and representative
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
Ford is giving me the high sign so okay
 
00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
and I trust representative Ford
 
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
implicitly on good good to know good to
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
know okay so she's an educated you can
 
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.029 align:start position:0%
know okay so she's an educated you can
trust

00:57:31.029 --> 00:57:31.039 align:start position:0%
trust
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
her so to sum up we took the average of
 
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
each of those and we subtracted 0 five
 
00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:43.480 align:start position:0%
and we got for line 11 on the tobacco um
 
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
tax we got
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
183.2 line 16 we got
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
173.50 any further
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
discussion all right actually would
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
someone like to make a motion on
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
this don't be shy representative
 
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
tney do I have a
 
00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:12.710 align:start position:0%
tney do I have a
second

00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
represent seeing no further discussion
 
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
um oh did you want to say something else
 
00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
no that's good all right your light is
 
00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
sorry left
 
00:58:24.589 --> 00:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
over um all in favor please raise your
 
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
hand of those numbers
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:39.029 --> 00:58:39.039 align:start position:0%
170 okay we have two left uh we'll now
 
00:58:39.039 --> 00:58:40.309 align:start position:0%
170 okay we have two left uh we'll now
go

00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:58:44.549 --> 00:58:44.559 align:start position:0%
to meals and rooms column B represent J
 
00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
and for the meals and rooms I would
 
00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
suggest that you go to the um first page
 
00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:51.160 align:start position:0%
where the Dr ranges are so you can use
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
the gross number okay on line seven when
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
you're doing your
 
00:58:59.150 --> 00:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
estimates because once you get that
 
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:01.640 align:start position:0%
number um we'll have to do a calculation
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
to back out the municipal transfer in
 
00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
the um School building right all right
 
00:59:09.069 --> 00:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
so if you look at page
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
s we have the high and low for 25
 
00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
do we have
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
a I have a comment so we don't have an
 
00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:39.319 align:start position:0%
act for number then on on that do
 
00:59:41.589 --> 00:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
we the the act for number would have
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
backed out um the transfers because
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
they're not in the general fund okay
 
00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:50.440 align:start position:0%
right so it's just so what yeah what I
 
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
meant is we don't have a gross you don't
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
have a gross number um yeah for plan
 
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
essentially but you could
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
um is it I think it's
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
131 for this
 
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:09.190 align:start position:0%
131 for this
year

01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.829 align:start position:0%
 
139

01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
139
 
01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:14.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean we could back into it once
 
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
we grab that number um
 
01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
okay representative Southworth a quick
 
01:00:26.109 --> 01:00:26.119 align:start position:0%
question so the top should say 25 26 27
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
correct yeah and I think I'm changing my
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
mind because it usually does better than
 
01:00:33.549 --> 01:00:33.559 align:start position:0%
we expect I was thinking of taking the
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
average and then adding a little bit to
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
it like 0.2 or something like that um
 
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
because for years it's come in better
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
than we expected and at least in the Sea
 
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
Coast Area people go out no matter what
 
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
happening I don't know at first I was
 
01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
going to say add 0.5 but I think that's
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
too much I just maybe add point2
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
yeah that's why I'd like to see what the
 
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
the gross number was to see how yeah I
 
01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
know you thank you um because once we
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
have that we can see these might already
 
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:54.829 align:start position:0%
 
exra

01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
General General thoughts while we're
 
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
numbers that's for 25
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
yes okay and this is for fiscal year 25
 
01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
which as I walked over completely forgot
 
01:02:58.109 --> 01:02:58.119 align:start position:0%
the number I
 
01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:00.920 align:start position:0%
quoted 4
 
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
63.2 yes representative
 
01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:05.240 align:start position:0%
Smith uh while we're waiting de mind if
 
01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:07.720 align:start position:0%
I ask a question well she's got the
 
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
number now uh 4
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
63.2 is the gross plan for fiscal year
 
01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
25 okay thank you um now did you have a
 
01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
question representative Smith 463 yes I
 
01:03:23.470 --> 01:03:23.480 align:start position:0%
did thank you uh excuse me Mr
 
01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:26.200 align:start position:0%
Shay I'm sorry Mr Shay yes I was curious
 
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
um do you know were these estimates put
 
01:03:29.789 --> 01:03:29.799 align:start position:0%
together using say a linear regression
 
01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:31.720 align:start position:0%
model or were they done say with a Time
 
01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
be so for um the for the M&amp;R um well I
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
do I look at the Historical trends for
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
each component of the tax to get a
 
01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:51.039 align:start position:0%
Baseline and then compare that to how
 
01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
the tax is doing to get to that range so
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
it is more of a Time ser Tech all right
 
01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
welcome and just uh for fiscal year 24
 
01:04:07.150 --> 01:04:07.160 align:start position:0%
the gross number would be
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
4647 it's not the AC for number that
 
01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
would have been the plan
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
number so you to the Acra number if you
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:33.549 --> 01:04:33.559 align:start position:0%
say that say that again what what number
 
01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
did you come up with so it' be four 467
 
01:04:38.589 --> 01:04:38.599 align:start position:0%
would have been with the a for number
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
plus what was removed for the municipal
 
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
all right so knowing
 
01:05:11.309 --> 01:05:11.319 align:start position:0%
that so if we look if we look at that
 
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
um so are we I'm a little confused
 
01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:25.750 align:start position:0%
um so are we I'm a little confused
463.3339

01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
67 would be fiscal year
 
01:05:31.589 --> 01:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
24 using the AC for number and making
 
01:05:35.269 --> 01:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
the adjustment for the um Municipal a
 
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
municipal fund and school building Aid
 
01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
transfer so that that seems a little
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
25 it when we said that rooms I thought
 
01:05:51.309 --> 01:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
so some of that has to do with the the
 
01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:53.480 align:start position:0%
municipal transfer that's why you have
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
to do the gross estimate and then we
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
have to back up out the transfer because
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
the calculation involves looking at last
 
01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.309 align:start position:0%
the calculation involves looking at last
year's

01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
year's
 
01:06:02.549 --> 01:06:02.559 align:start position:0%
Revenue coming up with a transfer number
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
that you appli to the year you're going
 
01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
to go to so you take 25's Revenue get
 
01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
figure out the municipal Revenue that
 
01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
should be transferred you make the
 
01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:13.640 align:start position:0%
transfer in 26 so your your estimated
 
01:06:16.109 --> 01:06:16.119 align:start position:0%
number may look a little lower or higher
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
based on the municipal transfer and the
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
school building Aid
 
01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
transfer okay and also um our high and
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
low for fiscal year 25 is a of the plan
 
01:06:28.589 --> 01:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
number that we are recommending so that
 
01:06:28.599 --> 01:06:55.630 align:start position:0%
number that we are recommending so that
463.3339

01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:58.109 --> 01:06:58.119 align:start position:0%
and they continue to go higher each each
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
year so do you still feel like it should
 
01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
be above the average that was my thought
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
but I'm very comfortable with the
 
01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
average yeah and it seems like they the
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
trend I was seeing they were seeing also
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
so seems like that is built in pretty
 
01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
well yeah it seems like it's built in I
 
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
just threw it out but I think the
 
01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
average is fine
 
01:07:19.710 --> 01:07:19.720 align:start position:0%
yeah other
 
01:07:21.789 --> 01:07:21.799 align:start position:0%
thoughts average higher than average
 
01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:26.200 align:start position:0%
lower than average I like the average
 
01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.710 align:start position:0%
lower than average I like the average
okay

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:07:29.789 --> 01:07:29.799 align:start position:0%
represent yeah I was picking up
 
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
conflicting Trends on some of the stuff
 
01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at one is that there was a
 
01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:35.480 align:start position:0%
trend after Co for people to get out of
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
the house start to enjoy life again the
 
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
other trend is now expenses are cing up
 
01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:43.640 align:start position:0%
credit card debt is increasing so it
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
seems to be flattening out with those
 
01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:05.870 --> 01:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
averages we're on column column B the
 
01:08:07.829 --> 01:08:07.839 align:start position:0%
averages are the numbers that's halfway
 
01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
between it's also called the median h no
 
01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:14.839 align:start position:0%
it's not no the median is
 
01:08:14.839 --> 01:08:16.910 align:start position:0%
it's not no the median is
different

01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.550 align:start position:0%
different
Med

01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
Med
 
01:08:21.309 --> 01:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
correct you mean medium mean yeah
 
01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
average and mean are the
 
01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:32.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
what okay yeah the growth rate from the
 
01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:41.349 align:start position:0%
what okay yeah the growth rate from the
24

01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
24
 
01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:42.910 align:start position:0%
24
to

01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:08:48.749 --> 01:08:48.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:48.759 --> 01:08:51.470 align:start position:0%
 
479

01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
479
 
01:09:10.349 --> 01:09:10.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question uh for the
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
low that is a
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
1.7% growth on the gross and on the high
 
01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
2.6% growth on the gross
 
01:09:29.309 --> 01:09:29.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
that the range is then two to 5% growth
 
01:09:37.149 --> 01:09:37.159 align:start position:0%
okay um so wait a minute just to be
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
clear so fy2 is 1.7 on the low side and
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
2.6 on the high side and then the
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
following gear are two on the low side
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
and 5% on the high side correct okay and
 
01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:51.759 align:start position:0%
that fiscal year 25 is on the um the AC
 
01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:05.149 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:10:05.149 --> 01:10:05.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
okay um all right so anyone not
 
01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
averages okay what are the averages then
 
01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:25.709 --> 01:10:25.719 align:start position:0%
B so it's the average of repres you're
 
01:10:27.149 --> 01:10:27.159 align:start position:0%
going to want to use the averages on
 
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
page three so you're going to want to
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
use a gross number and do your averages
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
off from that average on page three oh
 
01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
because we're presenting the gross
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
number you're gonna you're G to mention
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
a gross number and then either go to
 
01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
business taxes and once you've done that
 
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
I'll take a second and figure out what
 
01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
the meals and rooms will be or you can
 
01:10:47.709 --> 01:10:47.719 align:start position:0%
take a break and we can figure out meals
 
01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
and rooms and you can move the business
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
taxes but it'll take us five or 10
 
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
minutes just to run the number get the
 
01:10:56.350 --> 01:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
actual number yeah okay so Mr chairman I
 
01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
I've calculated the gross averages so
 
01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
4771 and representative Ford gives me
 
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
the can you talk in your microphone oh
 
01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
sorry 4 77.1 for fiscal
 
01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:17.630 align:start position:0%
sorry 4 77.1 for fiscal
25

01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
4939 for fiscal
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
26 and
 
01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
51.3 for fiscal 2
 
01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
7 and I even got a thumbs up from
 
01:11:33.149 --> 01:11:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
time all right um representative Aly
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
uh the cafer that we just calculated for
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
this year from last year is
 
01:11:53.149 --> 01:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
only somewhere between 1.7
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
2.5% growth
 
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
from FY 24 that's a lot lower than where
 
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
where we've been
 
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
growing and I'm
 
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
wondering at going to an average which
 
01:12:11.709 --> 01:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
is considerably higher than that for
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
term that's a really good question so
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
what we are really seeing and I think
 
01:12:22.510 --> 01:12:22.520 align:start position:0%
it's some of the conversation that we're
 
01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
talking about at what point have we hit
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
the top of the impact on the
 
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
inflationary cost on meals and people's
 
01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
ability to go out to eat in that shift
 
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
so what we had seen was very large
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
growth coming out of the pandemic with
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
that um what they've termed Revenge
 
01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
travel and I think we've just kind of
 
01:12:43.390 --> 01:12:43.400 align:start position:0%
just hit that bit but we still think but
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
I am still noticing that there is growth
 
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
um occurring and that the weather has
 
01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
been favorable and that there are people
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
that are still going out and um in some
 
01:12:55.870 --> 01:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
months I'm seeing Hotel seeing a shift
 
01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
upwards we had lost a couple of
 
01:12:59.390 --> 01:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
properties that are now coming back
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
8% oh wait I'm sorry are we on meals and
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
rooms or we moved on to business rooms
 
01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
okay five oh sorry sorry I was looking
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
at the business
 
01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:21.189 align:start position:0%
at the business
TX

01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
TX
 
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
um and I think to just piggyback on what
 
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
Lauren said it's yeah it's also the 2 to
 
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
5% range historically has been the trend
 
01:13:32.189 --> 01:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
for meals and rooms preo so I think um
 
01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
what Dr might be seeing is that we're
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
starting to get back into that that
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
normaly that we had before Co
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
struck yeah we were for a long time
 
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
year other okay other thoughts comments
 
01:13:59.950 --> 01:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:06.629 --> 01:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
Southworth um I make the motion for
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms for um to accept the
 
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
averages for
 
01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:18.350 align:start position:0%
averages for
2025

01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
2025
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
4771 for
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
2026 4
 
01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
511 um representative Aly did not hear
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
what you said yeah it well it's it's
 
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
hard to find a place on this chart to
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
put this stuff I just wrote it right
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
under the number in that little space
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
under the tun WR it under the dollar
 
01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
sign right
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so the second one
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
4771 yeah for what
 
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
493 oh I got totally
 
01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
wrong 4 93.9
 
01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.750 align:start position:0%
wrong 4 93.9
and

01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.790 align:start position:0%
and
5113

01:14:59.790 --> 01:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
5113
 
01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:09.030 align:start position:0%
5113
5113

01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
okay so um representative Southworth
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
just um made a motion to accept the
 
01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
averages and he just said what those
 
01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
averages were do I have a second second
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
further discussion seeing none all in
 
01:15:32.430 --> 01:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
favor please raise your
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
hand anyone
 
01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
opposed none okay so and I think we lost
 
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh what one person or is it still
 
01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
17 l two so 15 Mary had had to go to
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:58.629 --> 01:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
while they're calculating while um
 
01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
they're calculating the actual number uh
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
we can move on and discuss business
 
01:16:06.990 --> 01:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
taxes and um we've moved along very
 
01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
nicely to this point we have one one
 
01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
item left and that's business taxes uh
 
01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
yeah given that uh we we still have
 
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
U this afternoon to work on this as well
 
01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
and we we do have an exec session
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
starting at two but let's see what we
 
01:16:25.629 --> 01:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
can do I mean if we can come to
 
01:16:27.870 --> 01:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
agreement on business taxes then we
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
effectively would finish our Revenue
 
01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
estimates today and then it could be put
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
into a
 
01:16:37.629 --> 01:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
resolution um for a vote probably on on
 
01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
another day but uh yes represent elme
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you I know I said I was going to
 
01:16:49.550 --> 01:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
print out the the major end of month
 
01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:52.280 align:start position:0%
chart and I really feel
 
01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:53.830 align:start position:0%
chart and I really feel
uncomfortable

01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable
 
01:17:00.189 --> 01:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
on finishing this one before looking at
 
01:17:05.709 --> 01:17:05.719 align:start position:0%
it uh but I had so much I had to do when
 
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
I got home last night that I couldn't do
 
01:17:14.189 --> 01:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
that well can we um can we get it so
 
01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
what are you asking for end of month end
 
01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
of the end of month for January chart
 
01:17:25.149 --> 01:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
that shows the the refunds
 
01:17:25.159 --> 01:17:28.350 align:start position:0%
that shows the the refunds
the

01:17:28.350 --> 01:17:28.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:31.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh um it it's a it's a large it shows it
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
shows all the all the taxes plus the
 
01:17:40.629 --> 01:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
refunds plus the refunds and a number of
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
other things um what is that chart
 
01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
called sure so um for the business taxes
 
01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
that is um the name if you were to find
 
01:17:53.470 --> 01:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
it in your email it is called the legal
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
size business tax tax analysis yeah and
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
then it will say like fiscal year 2025
 
01:18:01.709 --> 01:18:01.719 align:start position:0%
and then whatever month you want to look
 
01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
at so the most current is what we call
 
01:18:04.159 --> 01:18:05.950 align:start position:0%
at so the most current is what we call
January

01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
January
 
01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:07.470 align:start position:0%
January
final

01:18:07.470 --> 01:18:07.480 align:start position:0%
final
 
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
right okay is there any way that uh we
 
01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
can get that printed out and get it for
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
one one o'clock continuation absolutely
 
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
okay oh
 
01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
good yeah it's only it's a two-sided
 
01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:28.470 align:start position:0%
good yeah it's only it's a two-sided
legal

01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
and I really want to see what's
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
happening to the refunds I
 
01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:36.199 align:start position:0%
mean can we get it sooner than one or is
 
01:18:38.430 --> 01:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know what your process
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:44.669 --> 01:18:44.679 align:start position:0%
so if you wanted to take a a short
 
01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
recess I can run back and print
 
01:18:49.870 --> 01:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
it um and then in that time frame we can
 
01:18:53.189 --> 01:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
tie up these Municipal numbers as well
 
01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
well you have lunch
 
01:18:57.229 --> 01:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
is there anything well can we talk about
 
01:18:59.070 --> 01:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
this without having those right
 
01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
now yeah um yeah bring them for for one
 
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
o'clock yeah I don't want to you know
 
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
because we're gonna get we're GNA get
 
01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
tight but um so one o'clock we'll have
 
01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
those numbers maybe maybe if all goes
 
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
well we can finish up uh today let me
 
01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
just ask this uh Chris if we if we vote
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
and finish this today um can you
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
um well no you have to create a
 
01:19:31.390 --> 01:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
resolution correct
 
01:19:34.350 --> 01:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
orh and then have to
 
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
so if your intention was to get your
 
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
numbers done today to finish your
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
numbers today um I think you you have
 
01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
executive session starting at 2 o'clock
 
01:19:46.110 --> 01:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so once you were done with me I'd
 
01:19:48.990 --> 01:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
go back I finish the splits come back
 
01:19:51.149 --> 01:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
with a final spreadsheet that you guys
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
would say yep that's what we want to see
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
and based on those numbers which show
 
01:19:56.669 --> 01:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
you the education trust fund and the
 
01:19:58.990 --> 01:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
general fund splits I would then create
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
the resolution for you I think you're
 
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
here tomorrow for exec sessions or Bill
 
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
work anyways uh I think exec session is
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
ex exec session mentioned on the I think
 
01:20:12.189 --> 01:20:12.199 align:start position:0%
it is exact could be done think we could
 
01:20:14.189 --> 01:20:14.199 align:start position:0%
but we don't have anything listen
 
01:20:17.950 --> 01:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
hearing tomor no I know we have he uh
 
01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:19.629 align:start position:0%
hearing tomor no I know we have he uh
oh

01:20:19.629 --> 01:20:19.639 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah we're hearings but we also
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
mention exact or we or we push but there
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
01:20:28.510 --> 01:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
hearings there a fair number of hearings
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
in there 3 in the morning 1 in the
 
01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
afternoon that's two one of them got
 
01:20:36.430 --> 01:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
removed so all I was going to suggest is
 
01:20:37.709 --> 01:20:37.719 align:start position:0%
I could
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
potentially try to get a resolution
 
01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:41.560 align:start position:0%
together for the end of your work
 
01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
tomorrow bring it to the committee so
 
01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
you could look at it and give a yay or a
 
01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
nay to it or sit on it for a period of
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
time to you know think about it I but I
 
01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
can talk with the chair at the break and
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
see how you want to proceed with it in
 
01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
terms of time of what your committee
 
01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
work is I mean I guess I just realized
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
too the I need to get the schedule in
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
for next week by 12:00 tomorrow so we
 
01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
probably won't have we won't know so
 
01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
what I'll do is I'll probably say that
 
01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
we're having a
 
01:21:13.709 --> 01:21:13.719 align:start position:0%
um oh um not sure how to phrase it work
 
01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
session or exec session on the
 
01:21:20.590 --> 01:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
um estimated numbers or on the
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
resolution I don't think I have to be
 
01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
that specific I I think could just
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
notice it as a work session on the on
 
01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
the numbers and then um the committee
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
would just do a final nod to the
 
01:21:33.870 --> 01:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
resolution yeah in case there's some
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
other information that comes to the
 
01:21:37.470 --> 01:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
committee's attention that you want to
 
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
make adjustments you still have the
 
01:21:41.950 --> 01:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that right yeah so
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll probably do that the 19th will
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
probably be that day to vote on this the
 
01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
other piece too is that the following
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
week is the I think isn't that the
 
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.070 align:start position:0%
week is the I think isn't that the
vacation

01:21:51.070 --> 01:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
vacation
 
01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
week so you wouldn't have a session that
 
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
week anyways for the resolution to go to
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
it would be the probably the first if
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
you have a session day in March it would
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
the first week of sorry the first week
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
of March would probably be the soonest
 
01:22:03.870 --> 01:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
that you would get the resolution before
 
01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
the full body no and that's fine I I
 
01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
would probably get it done uh next
 
01:22:11.709 --> 01:22:11.719 align:start position:0%
Wednesday the
 
01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
19th and it can be handed over to
 
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
finance before anybody else sees it yeah
 
01:22:19.709 --> 01:22:19.719 align:start position:0%
yeah that's yeah give finance an
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to jumping up and down okay
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
so if that's the case and my my effort
 
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
would be to get you a worksheet for
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
tomorrow um by the end of today maybe
 
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
but maybe first thing tomorrow so I can
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
make sure I don't forget fiscal year
 
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
numbers or anything like that yes we
 
01:22:38.189 --> 01:22:38.199 align:start position:0%
could just take a look at it then uh you
 
01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
resolution okay
 
01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
um so that being said uh we'll get that
 
01:22:50.239 --> 01:22:51.149 align:start position:0%
um so that being said uh we'll get that
uh

01:22:51.149 --> 01:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
calculation uh on the actual numbers for
 
01:22:59.470 --> 01:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms and
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
um we'll also get the spreadsheet for
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
one for one o'clock when we come back so
 
01:23:06.510 --> 01:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
in the meantime it's only 11:20 Let's uh
 
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
let's just discuss business taxes in
 
01:23:12.189 --> 01:23:12.199 align:start position:0%
general um we will get further backup
 
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
information um at one o'cl when we look
 
01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
at the January
 
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
numbers so who would like to go first
 
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
with their thoughts on business tax
 
01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth it might as
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
well be you
 
01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
um again I would just for a starting
 
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
point um look at the averages and my own
 
01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
opinion for analogy is just picture a
 
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
dart board I mean I'm just thinking yeah
 
01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:39.390 align:start position:0%
dart board I mean I'm just thinking yeah
yeah

01:23:39.390 --> 01:23:39.400 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:23:43.149 --> 01:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
transparency yeah we're we're we're
 
01:23:47.310 --> 01:23:47.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to be deliberative you know
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
they use many factors to do this and I
 
01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
just think uh um you know it's there a
 
01:23:54.149 --> 01:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
lot of things we could throw in and
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
we'll still come close to the average so
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
I would just put that out if someone
 
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
really has a crystal ball I haven't
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
heard of it
 
01:24:04.990 --> 01:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
yet okay represent
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
elme oh sorry Oh I thought you had
 
01:24:11.709 --> 01:24:11.719 align:start position:0%
something prophetic to
 
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
say uh representative ORS you look like
 
01:24:15.709 --> 01:24:15.719 align:start position:0%
you want to say
 
01:24:15.719 --> 01:24:18.910 align:start position:0%
you want to say
something

01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
okay so we're we're not going to vote on
 
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
this right now but I mean do people feel
 
01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable the averages do have
 
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:37.229 --> 01:24:37.239 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I had one note on here
 
01:24:40.830 --> 01:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
from somebody said that the low
 
01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
employment rate was good for the
 
01:24:46.590 --> 01:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
economy and I don't quite understand how
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
that works the low who said that uh I
 
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
can't I one of us oh someone in the
 
01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
committee said that yeah oh okay yeah
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
not not the people from Dr or LBA the
 
01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
low unemployment rate is that you said
 
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
yeah okay but it's a drag on our economy
 
01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:10.109 align:start position:0%
yeah okay but it's a drag on our economy
wow

01:25:10.109 --> 01:25:10.119 align:start position:0%
wow
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
and she may yeah represent yes represent
 
01:25:20.189 --> 01:25:20.199 align:start position:0%
you I yes and no it's a drag on the
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
economy in that it increases the wages
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
of uh employees
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
which affects the profitability of each
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
individual Corporation but it's a boom
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
to the uh GDP because it indicates that
 
01:25:40.910 --> 01:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
we're approaching a capacity uh of
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
production which
 
01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
then generates more Revenue
 
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
but in general
 
01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
it's a disincentive for businesses to
 
01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
locate here so you you got two minuses
 
01:25:59.790 --> 01:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
and a
 
01:26:04.189 --> 01:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
plus repres well it's a disincentive to
 
01:26:07.109 --> 01:26:07.119 align:start position:0%
businesses to stay here
 
01:26:10.750 --> 01:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
also uh when you can't get enough people
 
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
to run uh run your
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
business uh no matter what you're you
 
01:26:19.390 --> 01:26:19.400 align:start position:0%
can afford to pay them that that what's
 
01:26:21.629 --> 01:26:21.639 align:start position:0%
that's what I I mean in general the
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate my understanding is is
 
01:26:26.910 --> 01:26:26.920 align:start position:0%
low across the country so it's it's it's
 
01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
something that um a lot of states have
 
01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
that chall represent and I would I would
 
01:26:33.790 --> 01:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
counter that argument a bit if you've
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
got low unemployment then you got
 
01:26:37.229 --> 01:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
incentive to do investment in tools that
 
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
make your Workforce more productive and
 
01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
I think that would be an economic
 
01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
stimulus well okay
 
01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:46.310 align:start position:0%
stimulus well okay
representative

01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
Yi New Hampshire has becoming high-tech
 
01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
uh Hub um there was the article in
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
business uh New Hampshire uh regarding
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
in the Army program that we worked on uh
 
01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
which seems to um although we haven't
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
received a formal uh analysis of it the
 
01:27:05.709 --> 01:27:05.719 align:start position:0%
uh they've never given it to us I think
 
01:27:08.070 --> 01:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
we asked once yeah we ask again this
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
year the U that seems to be generating
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
good propaganda for them that indicates
 
01:27:16.430 --> 01:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire may be benefiting
 
01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
substantially from the uh uh Army
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
process but at the same time um
 
01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
depending upon world events
 
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh nashille and south Hudson uh and
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
miramac will'll see uh some growth um
 
01:27:34.990 --> 01:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
Hyperion should uh see some massive
 
01:27:37.790 --> 01:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
growth but you still have to hyperon
 
01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh need to have um somebody's
 
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
got to put the wrench to the screw
 
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
eventually and so
 
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
Rob yeah well they can do that but
 
01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
depends on what they're doing so
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative is um m is correct that
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
there would be an
 
01:27:58.639 --> 01:28:00.910 align:start position:0%
there would be an
increased

01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
increased
 
01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
um Proficiency in doing a single job
 
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
where we're a high-tech area we may get
 
01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
robots we may even get the robots to
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
move from rout three South to rout three
 
01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:15.070 align:start position:0%
move from rout three South to rout three
North

01:28:15.070 --> 01:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
North
 
01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:18.639 align:start position:0%
but it it depends on the cost of
 
01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
electricity and everything else so it's
 
01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
it's where where did is that Dart Bird
 
01:28:30.669 --> 01:28:30.679 align:start position:0%
Go D dartboard I know all right any and
 
01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
some are better shots than others so
 
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
have having heard uh represent Yul and
 
01:28:41.709 --> 01:28:41.719 align:start position:0%
okay representative Aly yes uh I just
 
01:28:41.719 --> 01:28:42.950 align:start position:0%
okay representative Aly yes uh I just
and

01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:46.229 --> 01:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
Lebanon has now that you said hyperon I
 
01:28:51.229 --> 01:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
hypothermal Nordisk uh for for the
 
01:28:58.430 --> 01:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
United States and it's got a lot of
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
medium level ones that you haven't heard
 
01:29:03.550 --> 01:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
of but are very important in the economy
 
01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
and they all are suffering from not
 
01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:08.870 align:start position:0%
and they all are suffering from not
enough

01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:29:11.950 --> 01:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
workers and they all are suffering
 
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
because and the hospital uh they they
 
01:29:19.709 --> 01:29:19.719 align:start position:0%
have 800 vacancies at at uh the largest
 
01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
hospital in New Hampshire uh and they
 
01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:27.990 align:start position:0%
hospital in New Hampshire uh and they
they

01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
um they cannot get Workers because the
 
01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
workers come wanting to work there and
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
then look for housing and then go
 
01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:40.510 align:start position:0%
then look for housing and then go
away

01:29:40.510 --> 01:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:42.629 align:start position:0%
away
so

01:29:42.629 --> 01:29:42.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
um I think I I see it
 
01:29:52.629 --> 01:29:52.639 align:start position:0%
as as a real problem in in our future
 
01:29:52.639 --> 01:29:54.750 align:start position:0%
as as a real problem in in our future
growth

01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
growth
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh because we're not going to be able to
 
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
solve the housing market sufficiently to
 
01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
help with this probably for years to
 
01:30:08.590 --> 01:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
come okay so uh representative ul and
 
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
representative Aly you've talked about
 
01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
this I want to hear each of you so
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
representa Aly where do you think where
 
01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:21.709 --> 01:30:21.719 align:start position:0%
numbers it's been suggested that we
 
01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
and I realize we're you know we're going
 
01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
to come back with get some more
 
01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
information when we come back from lunch
 
01:30:35.149 --> 01:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
but just for now while this is all you
 
01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
at the
 
01:30:55.109 --> 01:30:55.119 align:start position:0%
low St well no comes up it comes up a
 
01:30:58.350 --> 01:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
little bit in 26 and up in
 
01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:00.870 align:start position:0%
little bit in 26 and up in
27

01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
27
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
true well microphone represent Omie
 
01:31:18.990 --> 01:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
sorry I I think it will be be growing
 
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
some from there how much of it will be
 
01:31:25.709 --> 01:31:25.719 align:start position:0%
inflation I'm not sure yeah
 
01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
but we've got to do something about the
 
01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:30.520 align:start position:0%
housing and the something costs a lot of
 
01:31:33.229 --> 01:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
money and we've got too many other
 
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
things that we have to pay
 
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
for uh okay well so I I understand your
 
01:31:40.750 --> 01:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
concerns what I'm saying is where so
 
01:31:43.229 --> 01:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
where do you think where do you yeah
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
in I would
 
01:31:52.830 --> 01:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
be would be closer to the
 
01:31:57.550 --> 01:31:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.629 --> 01:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
25 then the
 
01:31:59.639 --> 01:32:03.990 align:start position:0%
25 then the
highend

01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.229 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:32:07.229 --> 01:32:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
say say about um
 
01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
one one
 
01:32:18.030 --> 01:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
1.4 billion we're talking a billion
 
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
there um no that doesn't make sense 1.4
 
01:32:25.550 --> 01:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
billion sorry no no no no not that one
 
01:32:29.629 --> 01:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
1.04 so I guess that would be 1.04 okay
 
01:32:33.950 --> 01:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
so instead of 1.06 or so you're at 1.04
 
01:32:37.109 --> 01:32:37.119 align:start position:0%
but all right after that I mean it's so
 
01:32:39.709 --> 01:32:39.719 align:start position:0%
hard to estimate whether we're going to
 
01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
be able to most most people can't but
 
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
that's why we're the ways and means
 
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
we're able to estimate estimate well I'd
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
like to see the refunds also okay I
 
01:32:51.709 --> 01:32:51.719 align:start position:0%
understand representative
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
I see the first
 
01:33:06.270 --> 01:33:06.280 align:start position:0%
quarter 25 being a little low and I see
 
01:33:10.109 --> 01:33:10.119 align:start position:0%
a steady growth going forward from there
 
01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
barring penal blowing up or something
 
01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
but I'll stick with the agency
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
low um and then maybe maybe reduce the
 
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
for 26 and then for
 
01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:35.149 align:start position:0%
for 26 and then for
27

01:33:35.149 --> 01:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
um maybe a little bit better just round
 
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
that right up to
 
01:33:48.229 --> 01:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:48.239 --> 01:33:50.310 align:start position:0%
 
25

01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
25
 
01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
1.1 black growth for the next two years
 
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
well 1.1 you're you're above the average
 
01:33:59.550 --> 01:33:59.560 align:start position:0%
then for 25 that doesn't make sense
 
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
no well above the well yeah the average
 
01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
is fine yeah the average is 0.0
 
01:34:08.669 --> 01:34:08.679 align:start position:0%
1.0 I don't know yeah
 
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
six 1.01 1.05 yeah somewhere in
 
01:34:16.990 --> 01:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
there representative you said did you
 
01:34:20.790 --> 01:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
something no sorry I'm gesturing and
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
thinking out
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
loud I don't think there's any uh Silver
 
01:34:30.430 --> 01:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
Bullet uh with the 25 estimates so i'
 
01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
I'd stay on the lowest side of of things
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
too so or 25 yeah and then 26 and 27
 
01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:45.030 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:46.750 align:start position:0%
yeah
it's

01:34:46.750 --> 01:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:34:49.629 --> 01:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
uh representative elme and then yeah I'd
 
01:34:52.510 --> 01:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
just like to point out if we're being
 
01:34:54.510 --> 01:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
consistent well I'm sorry you you
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
finished yeah go ahead we're we're
 
01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:00.189 align:start position:0%
finished yeah go ahead we're we're
rounding

01:35:00.189 --> 01:35:00.199 align:start position:0%
rounding
 
01:35:00.199 --> 01:35:01.910 align:start position:0%
rounding
to

01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:35:06.149 --> 01:35:06.159 align:start position:0%
100,000 point something so when we're
 
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
looking at a billion
 
01:35:15.149 --> 01:35:15.159 align:start position:0%
two we're we're we should be rounding to
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
a billion
 
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
2.5 or something like
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
02 and I just took that number out which
 
01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:36.270 --> 01:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
in representative I was just going to
 
01:35:39.070 --> 01:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
make kind of a blanket suggestion on the
 
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
conservative side of things I again
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
would stay with the lower estimate the
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
agency low low for 25 but allow for
 
01:35:48.030 --> 01:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
maybe a
 
01:35:51.149 --> 01:35:51.159 align:start position:0%
2.5% incremental
 
01:35:54.189 --> 01:35:54.199 align:start position:0%
increase on both both year is I think
 
01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
it's uh still within reason and it's
 
01:35:58.870 --> 01:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
still very conservative I think there's
 
01:36:00.910 --> 01:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of factors we could all sit here
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
and and talk about that that come into
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
come into play and again the crystal
 
01:36:10.750 --> 01:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
ball effect isn't you know that in two
 
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
bucks will get you a bowl of soup I
 
01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
think we're better off on the
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
conservative side yeah yeah I I think
 
01:36:18.189 --> 01:36:18.199 align:start position:0%
the I I agree with that I think the
 
01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
conservative side on 2025 especially
 
01:36:25.470 --> 01:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
because no matter
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
um how good or bad you think um you know
 
01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
the coming years are going to be even if
 
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
you think they're going to be good um
 
01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
we're not we're just starting uh
 
01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
nothing's going to change that fast and
 
01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
and and for 2025 we're talking about
 
01:36:45.390 --> 01:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
five more months so I I agree in the
 
01:36:47.229 --> 01:36:47.239 align:start position:0%
sense that probably the low end of 2025
 
01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
yeah because not not a whole lot's going
 
01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
to be changing and then we can talk
 
01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
about what we think the growth might be
 
01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
for 2026 and 2027 but I think that makes
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
sense representative South Southworth
 
01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I um put out the averages just to
 
01:37:08.910 --> 01:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
get the discussion going but my personal
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
opinion is we should lean towards the
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:18.030 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:37:18.030 --> 01:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:37:21.109 --> 01:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
representative I
 
01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
I've that is one of the reasons why I
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
asked the drra the commissioner to give
 
01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
us a historical analysis of the past of
 
01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
how they've been on and off but looking
 
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
at the business tax revenues from 2015
 
01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:37.350 align:start position:0%
at the business tax revenues from 2015
to

01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
2024 I believe that the last four years
 
01:37:43.229 --> 01:37:43.239 align:start position:0%
have been sort of an anomaly because of
 
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
the economic stimulus that has been
 
01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
thrown in there about
 
01:37:53.149 --> 01:37:53.159 align:start position:0%
um uh the supply chain I I think we're
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
going to see a lot of different things
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
occurring most of the changes from 2015
 
01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:00.629 align:start position:0%
occurring most of the changes from 2015
to

01:38:00.629 --> 01:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
2020 you were only looking as as
 
01:38:04.669 --> 01:38:04.679 align:start position:0%
representative Aly said somewhere
 
01:38:07.709 --> 01:38:07.719 align:start position:0%
between 150 200 million change up or
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
down as you go when we jump from 709
 
01:38:17.070 --> 01:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
million to 1 billion 300,000 it it there
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
there's there this is an anomaly and I
 
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
think that even the low we're going is
 
01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
too high
 
01:38:27.470 --> 01:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
I really believe that I but I'd like to
 
01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
see what the results of the
 
01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
Dr will be I think that we can we're 15%
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:38:38.589 --> 01:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
below what we should be in
 
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
plan 15% it's un audited I understand
 
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
but it's still 15% below
 
01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
so my feeling is that unless we're under
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
a billion I I just don't see us I
 
01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
myself won't be able to to
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
support I may be the negative vote but
 
01:38:59.350 --> 01:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
still go forward
 
01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:02.669 align:start position:0%
still go forward
mhm

01:39:02.669 --> 01:39:02.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay I mean one thing that I've I've
 
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
noticed and and Dr can correct me if
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
this is wrong but it seems like the
 
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
amount that we've been under as we go to
 
01:39:16.030 --> 01:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
each month isn't isn't changing that
 
01:39:18.629 --> 01:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
much it's a fairly steady amount is it's
 
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
pretty much a similar amount isn't it
 
01:39:23.470 --> 01:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
each month as we
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
just about so what really what we're
 
01:39:28.510 --> 01:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
seeing here is the um the tail end of
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
the estimates for tax year 24 and then
 
01:39:32.990 --> 01:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to start seeing the
 
01:39:37.149 --> 01:39:37.159 align:start position:0%
tax year 25 um in this spring so it's
 
01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
really one thing definitely need to
 
01:39:42.430 --> 01:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
consider is that we have historically
 
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
high overpayments and we and at the end
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
of fiscal year 24 we did have continued
 
01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
to have historically High
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
overpayments um in addition to the
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
refunds so so while we we can talk about
 
01:39:57.629 --> 01:39:57.639 align:start position:0%
what the economy is doing is how is that
 
01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
how is that cash going to
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
materialize and knowing that there are
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
these liabilities out there so we're
 
01:40:07.470 --> 01:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
seeing those Returns come in with zero
 
01:40:09.629 --> 01:40:09.639 align:start position:0%
cash associated with it either through
 
01:40:12.589 --> 01:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
those overestimate o o overestimates and
 
01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
those credit carryovers being
 
01:40:17.669 --> 01:40:17.679 align:start position:0%
utilized as because they have two
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
choices you can use it or you can get it
 
01:40:21.910 --> 01:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
refunded and and those are the two ways
 
01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing that so I think that's
 
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
something that we need to consider
 
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
too okay thank you um so my point was
 
01:40:32.669 --> 01:40:32.679 align:start position:0%
where we're seeing it we know the co
 
01:40:35.910 --> 01:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
money is slowly going away but yet the
 
01:40:39.310 --> 01:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
the monthlies while under aren't like
 
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
suddenly dropping faster um would uh
 
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
lead me
 
01:40:47.589 --> 01:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
to be more comfortable with the low the
 
01:40:50.990 --> 01:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
low number um but representative BS uh
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so I have a
 
01:40:55.350 --> 01:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
question thanks for taking it are the
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
employment numbers in the state of New
 
01:41:00.750 --> 01:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire over the last 68 months are
 
01:41:05.870 --> 01:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
down I didn't see a whole lot change and
 
01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
and from what I understand when I was
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
updating the presentation that we are
 
01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
actually doing better than the United
 
01:41:16.189 --> 01:41:16.199 align:start position:0%
States uh the state of New Hampshire in
 
01:41:18.510 --> 01:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
terms of that unemployment rate in a
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
good way thank you so that would confirm
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
what I'm thinking which my crystal balls
 
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
know better than anybody else but I'm
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
thinking we ought to be on the low end a
 
01:41:32.350 --> 01:41:32.360 align:start position:0%
little bit if you will for 2025 but I'm
 
01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
very optimistic for 26 and
 
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
27 I believe we're going to solve this
 
01:41:39.070 --> 01:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
housing problem through
 
01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:53.910 --> 01:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
us Aly yes uh the housing problem is
 
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
going to require the kind of money I
 
01:41:58.709 --> 01:41:58.719 align:start position:0%
think if we were actually going to get
 
01:41:59.910 --> 01:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
it done
 
01:42:06.030 --> 01:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
fast on that on we are facing spending
 
01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:42:16.109 --> 01:42:16.119 align:start position:0%
lawsuits for um the the CH the child
 
01:42:16.119 --> 01:42:18.350 align:start position:0%
lawsuits for um the the CH the child
system

01:42:18.350 --> 01:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
which and we do have some other law on
 
01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
lawsuits that we don't know what's going
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
to happen with them so um
 
01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:30.430 align:start position:0%
to happen with them so um
but

01:42:30.430 --> 01:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
but it's going it we would have to be
 
01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
paying really good
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
wages uh to the people who produce the
 
01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
housing in order to get them to come
 
01:42:50.669 --> 01:42:50.679 align:start position:0%
here rather than in Massachusetts or in
 
01:42:53.430 --> 01:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
South Carolina a lot of our people that
 
01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
that did this kind of thing moved to
 
01:42:58.910 --> 01:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
South Carolina North Carolina
 
01:43:02.910 --> 01:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
Florida uh because they couldn't get
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
jobs here we had two recessions housing
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
recessions uh one just before I came
 
01:43:15.550 --> 01:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
came home and and the other one in the
 
01:43:19.870 --> 01:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
Great Recession and people just that
 
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
kind of people just left because they
 
01:43:24.189 --> 01:43:24.199 align:start position:0%
had good skills they were going to use
 
01:43:26.750 --> 01:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
them places where it was easier to make
 
01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:29.790 align:start position:0%
them places where it was easier to make
a

01:43:29.790 --> 01:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:34.270 --> 01:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
living thank you any other uh any other
 
01:43:36.109 --> 01:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
thoughts I mean at this point um you
 
01:43:39.550 --> 01:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
know we we will come back at one o'clock
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
and um have a little more data to look
 
01:43:46.589 --> 01:43:46.599 align:start position:0%
at um and um unless someone else has
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
something i''d like to say right now I
 
01:43:50.189 --> 01:43:50.199 align:start position:0%
think we'll we'll probably adjourn and
 
01:43:51.870 --> 01:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
come back at
 
01:43:55.350 --> 01:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
one okay okay all right we'll come back
 
01:44:22.030 --> 01:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:52.030 align:start position:0%

01:44:52.030 --> 01:44:52.040 align:start position:0%

03:00:46.910 --> 03:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:46.920 --> 03:01:16.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:01:16.910 --> 03:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:16.920 --> 03:01:46.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:01:46.830 --> 03:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:19.510 --> 03:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:21.910 --> 03:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
okay the time being 101 we'll get back
 
03:02:27.150 --> 03:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
to work on our final estimates on uh
 
03:02:31.070 --> 03:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
business taxes so um Chris if you want
 
03:02:32.710 --> 03:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
to just let us know what you just passed
 
03:02:35.110 --> 03:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
out that would be a good start yep so
 
03:02:36.790 --> 03:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
you got two long sheets that I just put
 
03:02:39.269 --> 03:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
in front of everyone uh the first one is
 
03:02:41.110 --> 03:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
the business tax analysis sheet it's a
 
03:02:44.990 --> 03:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
two-sided 8 and half by 14 it has um I
 
03:02:46.750 --> 03:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
thinkom had asked for the refund
 
03:02:48.790 --> 03:02:48.800 align:start position:0%
information which is um um part of
 
03:02:50.630 --> 03:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
what's in there you have returns you
 
03:02:53.229 --> 03:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
have extensions so and it's a history
 
03:02:58.190 --> 03:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
for the last 10 years I think is and so
 
03:02:59.830 --> 03:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
um as many of you have noted uh the
 
03:03:01.950 --> 03:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
print is kind of small it's because
 
03:03:05.269 --> 03:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of information um I sent
 
03:03:08.590 --> 03:03:08.600 align:start position:0%
an email yesterday with forwarding all
 
03:03:10.710 --> 03:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
these documents to you so if you have a
 
03:03:12.790 --> 03:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
computer you can pull it up or if you're
 
03:03:15.229 --> 03:03:15.239 align:start position:0%
at home you can look at it there as well
 
03:03:18.590 --> 03:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
the second long sheet was just uh refund
 
03:03:20.910 --> 03:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
analysis for the business taxes as well
 
03:03:22.469 --> 03:03:22.479 align:start position:0%
as the interest and dividends just so
 
03:03:24.309 --> 03:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit larger print it's a
 
03:03:26.070 --> 03:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
one-sided 8 and a half
 
03:03:29.349 --> 03:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
by14 um again just trying to get
 
03:03:30.910 --> 03:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
something that people can look at so you
 
03:03:33.630 --> 03:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
can um use that as you need and then the
 
03:03:36.870 --> 03:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
last document is an 8 and 1 12 by 11
 
03:03:39.590 --> 03:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
with a little box at the top these are
 
03:03:41.429 --> 03:03:41.439 align:start position:0%
the um M&amp;R
 
03:03:45.670 --> 03:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
estimates so if you look at it you 25 26
 
03:03:49.590 --> 03:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
and 27 um the second um column is the
 
03:03:52.030 --> 03:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
gross average that you came up with so
 
03:03:56.590 --> 03:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
that's the 4771 the 4939 and the
 
03:04:00.190 --> 03:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
51.3 from there um I worked with the and
 
03:04:02.910 --> 03:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
we did a calculation to determine what
 
03:04:06.590 --> 03:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
the municipal um transfer would be that
 
03:04:09.389 --> 03:04:09.399 align:start position:0%
goes into that dedicated fund as well as
 
03:04:10.750 --> 03:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
the school building Aid and that's the
 
03:04:14.349 --> 03:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
number in the third column over the 1432
 
03:04:16.229 --> 03:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
1454 and the
 
03:04:18.670 --> 03:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
1501 you take that away and you come up
 
03:04:20.190 --> 03:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
with the net revenue that will be what's
 
03:04:26.110 --> 03:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:29.750 --> 03:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
333.7401 million in 26 and 361.50
 
03:04:31.830 --> 03:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
million in fiscal year
 
03:04:34.630 --> 03:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
27 so those are the three documents that
 
03:04:36.710 --> 03:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
weren't at your dat table when you left
 
03:05:18.550 --> 03:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:19.870 --> 03:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
represent El
 
03:05:25.190 --> 03:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
me thank you if everybody has understood
 
03:05:28.389 --> 03:05:28.399 align:start position:0%
the meals and rooms Revenue estimate I'd
 
03:05:34.550 --> 03:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:40.790 --> 03:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:43.510 --> 03:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
okay you want to speak to
 
03:05:51.110 --> 03:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:57.870 --> 03:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:01.349 --> 03:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
looks it it I I believe this is from the
 
03:06:05.870 --> 03:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
numbers that we gave you yes yes so it
 
03:06:10.110 --> 03:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
it represents a little bit lower than
 
03:06:14.469 --> 03:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
the middle uh except that it is
 
03:06:19.349 --> 03:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
different because we are um using we are
 
03:06:21.630 --> 03:06:21.640 align:start position:0%
having to take a different amount of
 
03:06:24.349 --> 03:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
annual transfer out for the
 
03:06:26.590 --> 03:06:26.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities each year and sometimes
 
03:06:29.750 --> 03:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's above uh looks like it
 
03:06:35.590 --> 03:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
was below this time for 25 so so the
 
03:06:39.349 --> 03:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
each year as the Ms and re
 
03:06:42.950 --> 03:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh M&amp;R comes in higher the following
 
03:06:44.830 --> 03:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
year you're going to see more taken out
 
03:06:47.309 --> 03:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
to go into the municipal Revenue uh fund
 
03:06:47.319 --> 03:06:48.590 align:start position:0%
to go into the municipal Revenue uh fund
right

03:06:48.590 --> 03:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:06:50.389 --> 03:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
so that does have an impact on the
 
03:06:53.150 --> 03:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
amount left that would go to the general
 
03:06:56.229 --> 03:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
fund so this is what we were talking
 
03:06:59.510 --> 03:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
about in all three cases yeah and it and
 
03:07:01.269 --> 03:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
it ends up being pretty close to the
 
03:07:01.279 --> 03:07:03.830 align:start position:0%
it ends up being pretty close to the
average

03:07:03.830 --> 03:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
average
 
03:07:07.349 --> 03:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
yeah it does all right so I don't I
 
03:07:09.190 --> 03:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
don't think there's any surprises here
 
03:07:11.190 --> 03:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
um is
 
03:07:14.349 --> 03:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
uh if there's no more discussion on that
 
03:07:17.550 --> 03:07:17.560 align:start position:0%
then uh let's we'll just vote on these
 
03:07:19.750 --> 03:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
updated numbers uh all in favor raise
 
03:07:19.760 --> 03:07:21.590 align:start position:0%
updated numbers uh all in favor raise
your

03:07:21.590 --> 03:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:07:21.600 --> 03:07:23.150 align:start position:0%
your
hand

03:07:23.150 --> 03:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
hand
 
03:07:29.950 --> 03:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:34.750 --> 03:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
okay 14 15 16 yeah we voted um if
 
03:07:36.469 --> 03:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
there's if there's any confusion the
 
03:07:37.950 --> 03:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
reason it seems like we voted on it
 
03:07:40.750 --> 03:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
twice is the first time we voted on the
 
03:07:45.590 --> 03:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh the Topline numbers the gross numbers
 
03:07:48.550 --> 03:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh and now that we have the actual
 
03:07:52.349 --> 03:07:52.359 align:start position:0%
numbers um as per
 
03:07:56.070 --> 03:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
the sheet that we just went over um
 
03:07:59.070 --> 03:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
that's why we just voted on those yes so
 
03:08:03.910 --> 03:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
we confirmed math we confirmed our math
 
03:08:07.110 --> 03:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so that brings us back to
 
03:08:07.120 --> 03:08:08.190 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so that brings us back to
business

03:08:08.190 --> 03:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
business
 
03:08:12.990 --> 03:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
taxes and um represent are you elme you
 
03:08:15.710 --> 03:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
ready to speak on that I would like to
 
03:08:18.790 --> 03:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
talk with the Dr
 
03:08:21.750 --> 03:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
about the uh what I remembered was that
 
03:08:23.710 --> 03:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
they said that the
 
03:08:27.750 --> 03:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
refunds uh are dwindling away at this
 
03:08:30.830 --> 03:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
point it looks like the refunds are
 
03:08:38.469 --> 03:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:40.950 --> 03:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
year well I I think what was mentioned
 
03:08:43.590 --> 03:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
earlier with um by Lauren is that there
 
03:08:44.950 --> 03:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
is going to continue to be some
 
03:08:46.429 --> 03:08:46.439 align:start position:0%
adjustments in
 
03:08:50.630 --> 03:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
25 shouldn't be maybe as much as in 24
 
03:08:52.630 --> 03:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
but as we move further away from 25 you
 
03:08:54.349 --> 03:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
should see less of that because again
 
03:08:56.990 --> 03:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
the idea of the right sizing of the CCO
 
03:09:00.830 --> 03:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
and your um your your business tax rate
 
03:09:02.670 --> 03:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
reductions The Bu the businesses have
 
03:09:04.590 --> 03:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
adjusted for those with their new
 
03:09:07.590 --> 03:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
estimates um but yeah eventually we'll
 
03:09:09.190 --> 03:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
get there but it doesn't look like we're
 
03:09:11.429 --> 03:09:11.439 align:start position:0%
getting there in
 
03:09:14.429 --> 03:09:14.439 align:start position:0%
25 well I think I mean they can correct
 
03:09:15.750 --> 03:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong but if I look at the
 
03:09:18.870 --> 03:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
refund um schedule I mean I it seems to
 
03:09:23.389 --> 03:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
be less than than prior year um so I
 
03:09:25.110 --> 03:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
mean I think you're seeing the trend of
 
03:09:26.670 --> 03:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
coming down when you compare it to the
 
03:09:30.670 --> 03:09:30.680 align:start position:0%
previous year's equal month it
 
03:09:33.830 --> 03:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
it maybe well I think I think what's
 
03:09:36.630 --> 03:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
What's Happening Here is that in 2024
 
03:09:38.910 --> 03:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
when you see this big jump yeah the
 
03:09:41.710 --> 03:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
reason for that is because people were
 
03:09:43.950 --> 03:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
were asking for refunds thinking that it
 
03:09:45.389 --> 03:09:45.399 align:start position:0%
was dropping to
 
03:09:50.269 --> 03:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
250% from 500% on we then at the end um
 
03:09:53.110 --> 03:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh no I'm sorry I'm in the wrong year
 
03:09:55.550 --> 03:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
2023 is when
 
03:09:58.670 --> 03:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
that started was when that started and
 
03:10:01.469 --> 03:10:01.479 align:start position:0%
we and we changed it so at that point
 
03:10:04.710 --> 03:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
people were in 2023 being informed that
 
03:10:06.710 --> 03:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to go to 20
 
03:10:09.550 --> 03:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
250% so they started making changes in
 
03:10:12.590 --> 03:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
their in their uh ask for refunds but
 
03:10:17.070 --> 03:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
then in was it in 2024 uh we changed
 
03:10:19.990 --> 03:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
that to stay at 500% for the next five
 
03:10:22.429 --> 03:10:22.439 align:start position:0%
years and so now you're probably seen
 
03:10:23.950 --> 03:10:23.960 align:start position:0%
that behavior change and you're seeing a
 
03:10:27.110 --> 03:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
drop 111 down to 94 so I think the big
 
03:10:28.469 --> 03:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
jump up was because they were
 
03:10:31.750 --> 03:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
anticipating this huge change and now we
 
03:10:37.630 --> 03:10:37.640 align:start position:0%
are getting away from that well it's
 
03:10:37.640 --> 03:10:39.469 align:start position:0%
are getting away from that well it's
85.4

03:10:39.469 --> 03:10:39.479 align:start position:0%
85.4
 
03:10:43.070 --> 03:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
million on half
 
03:10:43.080 --> 03:10:45.190 align:start position:0%
million on half
year

03:10:45.190 --> 03:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:10:52.309 --> 03:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:55.550 --> 03:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
15 well there were 15 million that came
 
03:10:58.429 --> 03:10:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:01.510 --> 03:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
January so it's it's pretty close to
 
03:11:05.910 --> 03:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
what it was last year when we finish off
 
03:11:08.870 --> 03:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:13.469 --> 03:11:13.479 align:start position:0%
probably so if you compare the um second
 
03:11:17.309 --> 03:11:17.319 align:start position:0%
to last row that's your fiscal year um
 
03:11:19.830 --> 03:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
to date so that would give you when
 
03:11:21.469 --> 03:11:21.479 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the January number for
 
03:11:23.550 --> 03:11:23.560 align:start position:0%
25 that gives you how much was collected
 
03:11:26.309 --> 03:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
through um January 24 you can see it was
 
03:11:29.750 --> 03:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
111 in change in 24 and it's 94 in
 
03:11:31.309 --> 03:11:31.319 align:start position:0%
change in in
 
03:11:34.190 --> 03:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
2025 so it's down slightly from in the
 
03:11:35.750 --> 03:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
first seven months as it compared to
 
03:11:39.190 --> 03:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
last year um it's not that it's gone
 
03:11:41.950 --> 03:11:41.960 align:start position:0%
away you still have it it's higher than
 
03:11:44.550 --> 03:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
previous the CCO and business tax
 
03:11:46.870 --> 03:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
changes but I think what Dr has
 
03:11:49.550 --> 03:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
presented is that um they expect this to
 
03:11:51.750 --> 03:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
start to smooth out the companies have
 
03:11:54.630 --> 03:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
made the adjustment not to carry as much
 
03:11:56.389 --> 03:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
money going forward because they're
 
03:11:57.910 --> 03:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
being told you can't have it here if
 
03:12:00.190 --> 03:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
you're over 500% the Dr is going to give
 
03:12:02.389 --> 03:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
it back to you in that process they've
 
03:12:03.950 --> 03:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
also right-sized their estimates as it
 
03:12:06.429 --> 03:12:06.439 align:start position:0%
relates to their business tax payments
 
03:12:09.550 --> 03:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
estimates so the combination of the two
 
03:12:11.070 --> 03:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
I think what has been suggested when you
 
03:12:14.110 --> 03:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
get in the 26 and 27 you should see kind
 
03:12:15.990 --> 03:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
of a you're going to still have refunds
 
03:12:17.510 --> 03:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
no matter what but you're not going to
 
03:12:19.590 --> 03:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
have as greater refunds as you've seen
 
03:12:22.070 --> 03:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
in the last couple years until you get
 
03:12:25.110 --> 03:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
to the next stepping stone with the
 
03:12:28.630 --> 03:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
ccos and if I'm incorrect I asked drra
 
03:12:30.190 --> 03:12:30.200 align:start position:0%
to jump up wave their hands and let you
 
03:12:32.550 --> 03:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
know that I'm speaking out of turn yeah
 
03:12:34.790 --> 03:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
you got a thumbs up so all right
 
03:12:37.469 --> 03:12:37.479 align:start position:0%
perfect there was something else going
 
03:12:41.550 --> 03:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
on there which was that and
 
03:12:46.229 --> 03:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh uh commissioner steep agreed with me
 
03:12:48.190 --> 03:12:48.200 align:start position:0%
when we were talking about this last
 
03:12:52.550 --> 03:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
fall that there were was a
 
03:12:56.590 --> 03:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
probability that the big firms that for
 
03:13:02.910 --> 03:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
whom we are a DOT on a page uh uh were
 
03:13:05.150 --> 03:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
not noticing that we had been cutting
 
03:13:08.510 --> 03:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
their taxes for the last X years it's
 
03:13:12.229 --> 03:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
been 8 10 years or whatever it is on and
 
03:13:14.510 --> 03:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
were not noticing that they had left a
 
03:13:18.190 --> 03:13:18.200 align:start position:0%
lot of money sitting on the table
 
03:13:22.429 --> 03:13:22.439 align:start position:0%
and um corrected that we're correcting
 
03:13:27.150 --> 03:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
that um so it's there there are two
 
03:13:29.429 --> 03:13:29.439 align:start position:0%
things operating there and the question
 
03:13:32.830 --> 03:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
is when does the well run dry a
 
03:13:35.950 --> 03:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
bit when do they they finish taking
 
03:13:35.960 --> 03:13:38.870 align:start position:0%
bit when do they they finish taking
stuff

03:13:38.870 --> 03:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:41.150 --> 03:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
out and well I don't think it's going to
 
03:13:43.269 --> 03:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
run dry for a while because we're it's
 
03:13:45.550 --> 03:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
going to level off a little bit but
 
03:13:48.070 --> 03:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
we're still at 500% and at some point
 
03:13:52.349 --> 03:13:52.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to get close to 2029 and um
 
03:13:55.750 --> 03:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
well yeah and we we're gonna have the
 
03:13:57.910 --> 03:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
same issue potentially we may have the
 
03:13:57.920 --> 03:13:58.830 align:start position:0%
same issue potentially we may have the
same

03:13:58.830 --> 03:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
same
 
03:14:03.309 --> 03:14:03.319 align:start position:0%
issue but do we have anyone left with
 
03:14:05.190 --> 03:14:05.200 align:start position:0%
more than
 
03:14:10.389 --> 03:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:10.399 --> 03:14:14.590 align:start position:0%
 
treasury

03:14:14.590 --> 03:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:18.229 --> 03:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
just so representative Al each year um
 
03:14:20.950 --> 03:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers may find themselves again
 
03:14:24.190 --> 03:14:24.200 align:start position:0%
above the 500% level because if they pay
 
03:14:27.070 --> 03:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
more in uh again even after they've
 
03:14:28.710 --> 03:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
received a refund that gets them down to
 
03:14:31.429 --> 03:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
that cap um then if they pay additional
 
03:14:33.630 --> 03:14:33.640 align:start position:0%
estimates in the subsequent year they
 
03:14:36.830 --> 03:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
could again exceed the cap so there may
 
03:14:40.550 --> 03:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
always be some uh forced refunds to get
 
03:14:43.790 --> 03:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
people down to that 500% cap on what
 
03:14:47.830 --> 03:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
they can carry forward but uh we have at
 
03:14:50.750 --> 03:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
this point cleared out a lot of the
 
03:14:53.870 --> 03:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
large um balances that were being
 
03:14:56.670 --> 03:14:56.680 align:start position:0%
carried forward from older tax years um
 
03:14:58.070 --> 03:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
in the last two years when we've been
 
03:14:59.990 --> 03:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
applying the cap and I think the
 
03:15:03.309 --> 03:15:03.319 align:start position:0%
conversation that you may have been um
 
03:15:05.550 --> 03:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
thinking of from the commissioner last
 
03:15:09.710 --> 03:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
fall was basically to that effect that
 
03:15:13.110 --> 03:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
that we have now cleared out a lot of
 
03:15:15.309 --> 03:15:15.319 align:start position:0%
the higher balances and that there is an
 
03:15:17.750 --> 03:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
expectation that until the cap drops
 
03:15:22.229 --> 03:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
again that that that may level off um
 
03:15:25.950 --> 03:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
also um keeping in mind
 
03:15:28.150 --> 03:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
that the other piece that she talked
 
03:15:31.910 --> 03:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
about yesterday was that estimates um
 
03:15:35.229 --> 03:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
having now um that there's a lag between
 
03:15:36.590 --> 03:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
when the estimates are made and then
 
03:15:39.070 --> 03:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
when the return is filed that taxpayers
 
03:15:41.630 --> 03:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
have now learned um how our new system
 
03:15:43.269 --> 03:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
works and maybe right sizing their
 
03:15:45.510 --> 03:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
estimates so that that may also change
 
03:15:52.910 --> 03:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:57.910 --> 03:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
this the treasury told us essentially
 
03:16:00.469 --> 03:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
that that they were going to be going
 
03:16:02.429 --> 03:16:02.439 align:start position:0%
down in the amount of Interest they were
 
03:16:04.229 --> 03:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
paying but it didn't seem like it was
 
03:16:05.790 --> 03:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
going down a
 
03:16:05.800 --> 03:16:08.229 align:start position:0%
going down a
lot

03:16:08.229 --> 03:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
lot
 
03:16:08.239 --> 03:16:12.670 align:start position:0%
lot
and

03:16:12.670 --> 03:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:16.349 --> 03:16:16.359 align:start position:0%
the the other thing about this is that
 
03:16:16.359 --> 03:16:17.990 align:start position:0%
the the other thing about this is that
people

03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:16:22.469 --> 03:16:22.479 align:start position:0%
um we could never figure out why people
 
03:16:26.990 --> 03:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
were leaving this huge excess of money
 
03:16:29.469 --> 03:16:29.479 align:start position:0%
in our treasury at first we thought it
 
03:16:32.990 --> 03:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
was because the federal
 
03:16:38.189 --> 03:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
taxation on on limit was too high that
 
03:16:41.309 --> 03:16:41.319 align:start position:0%
uh on percentage that they taxed at the
 
03:16:45.550 --> 03:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
highest levels of of income was too high
 
03:16:48.269 --> 03:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
and then they did the tax cuts and jobs
 
03:16:50.469 --> 03:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
acts and it didn't seem to make much of
 
03:16:50.479 --> 03:16:51.229 align:start position:0%
acts and it didn't seem to make much of
any

03:16:51.229 --> 03:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:16:51.239 --> 03:16:52.830 align:start position:0%
any
difference

03:16:52.830 --> 03:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
difference
 
03:16:56.510 --> 03:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
um just to clarify uh the money that the
 
03:16:59.990 --> 03:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
businesses leave at Dr in in that credit
 
03:17:02.670 --> 03:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
carrier over payments don't earn
 
03:17:05.750 --> 03:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
interest so that does that's not
 
03:17:07.110 --> 03:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
connected to what the treasurer was
 
03:17:08.510 --> 03:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
talking about in terms of the interest
 
03:17:10.990 --> 03:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
that she's dealing with uhhuh it's a
 
03:17:13.630 --> 03:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
cash in cash out type of a system
 
03:17:16.189 --> 03:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
there's a paper record of what companies
 
03:17:18.429 --> 03:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
have paid what they might have overpaid
 
03:17:20.150 --> 03:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
so when they true it up it's all done on
 
03:17:22.309 --> 03:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
a paper and if we have to pay them back
 
03:17:23.870 --> 03:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
it's t taken out of the cash that's
 
03:17:25.469 --> 03:17:25.479 align:start position:0%
collected the month you're doing that
 
03:17:27.950 --> 03:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
refund and that's why if you look at the
 
03:17:30.389 --> 03:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
daily revenue reports you'll sometimes
 
03:17:32.229 --> 03:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
see a fluctuation in the business tax
 
03:17:34.309 --> 03:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
where you got a negative adjustment on a
 
03:17:38.510 --> 03:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
particular day um the Dr typically has
 
03:17:41.229 --> 03:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
done um a refund issue at that point and
 
03:17:44.429 --> 03:17:44.439 align:start position:0%
that's what accounts for those um so
 
03:17:45.670 --> 03:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I just want to make sure it's clear
 
03:17:47.550 --> 03:17:47.560 align:start position:0%
that the the there's no interest earned
 
03:17:49.389 --> 03:17:49.399 align:start position:0%
on those those dollars that that the
 
03:17:51.510 --> 03:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
companies deposit with the state it's a
 
03:17:55.630 --> 03:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
cash in cash out type of basis um so
 
03:17:57.710 --> 03:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
that one is not related to this one
 
03:17:59.510 --> 03:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
right right the the interest that the
 
03:18:01.990 --> 03:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
treasurer was talking about is more
 
03:18:03.550 --> 03:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
related to the cash on hand as it
 
03:18:08.990 --> 03:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
relates to um arpa the infrastructure
 
03:18:11.429 --> 03:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
act money um and then just having
 
03:18:14.830 --> 03:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
healthy balances with our um uh rainy
 
03:18:18.189 --> 03:18:18.199 align:start position:0%
day fund um you education trust fund has
 
03:18:20.229 --> 03:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
a balance to it so you had a pool of
 
03:18:22.030 --> 03:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
cash that she's able to invest and earn
 
03:18:24.950 --> 03:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
some interest on in the next year and a
 
03:18:26.750 --> 03:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
half you expect to see much of the arpa
 
03:18:29.309 --> 03:18:29.319 align:start position:0%
to disappear um the trend we're seeing
 
03:18:30.790 --> 03:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
with the education trust fund is that
 
03:18:33.429 --> 03:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
balance is shrinking um so there may not
 
03:18:36.269 --> 03:18:36.279 align:start position:0%
be as much money to invest to get
 
03:18:37.670 --> 03:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
interest and that's why she's showing
 
03:18:40.389 --> 03:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
you that by the end of 27 the trajectory
 
03:18:41.710 --> 03:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
is down and we're going to probably get
 
03:18:44.469 --> 03:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
closer to more of our normals um you
 
03:18:45.990 --> 03:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
know the the the big fund that should
 
03:18:47.830 --> 03:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
stay healthy I think is the rainy day
 
03:18:49.910 --> 03:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
fund as long as nothing surprises Us in
 
03:18:52.670 --> 03:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
the nor used to be that there was not
 
03:18:55.510 --> 03:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
enough to invest that that's correct
 
03:19:02.070 --> 03:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:04.630 --> 03:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
correct I still don't like the size of
 
03:19:10.269 --> 03:19:10.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:14.030 --> 03:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
but but we were deciding
 
03:19:14.040 --> 03:19:15.710 align:start position:0%
but but we were deciding
to

03:19:15.710 --> 03:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:19:22.670 --> 03:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
to go below the go below the
 
03:19:24.790 --> 03:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
average yeah I think if we're if we're
 
03:19:27.510 --> 03:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
on the low side of the average that may
 
03:19:36.110 --> 03:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:38.910 --> 03:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
concern and it may it may in fact Force
 
03:19:44.510 --> 03:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:48.030 --> 03:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
um other thoughts
 
03:19:49.670 --> 03:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
or questions if you have questions about
 
03:19:52.229 --> 03:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
this sheet yes I just a question I guess
 
03:19:54.910 --> 03:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
back to representative yery okay were
 
03:19:56.870 --> 03:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
you're thinking that um we were aiming
 
03:19:59.790 --> 03:19:59.800 align:start position:0%
towards um the low estimate on all of
 
03:20:02.910 --> 03:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
these um
 
03:20:05.070 --> 03:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
years yeah I would be a little more
 
03:20:08.830 --> 03:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
optimistic for 27 but that's I was just
 
03:20:11.870 --> 03:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
trying to clarify yeah okay I'd agree
 
03:20:18.429 --> 03:20:18.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:21.349 --> 03:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
anybody anybody else have thoughts or or
 
03:20:23.229 --> 03:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
or maybe questions about the sheets that
 
03:20:25.429 --> 03:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
we have here everyone understand what's
 
03:20:28.349 --> 03:20:28.359 align:start position:0%
here uh representative ORS uh thank you
 
03:20:30.670 --> 03:20:30.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so yeah I'm I'm looking at
 
03:20:34.469 --> 03:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
the numbers and I'm thinking I agree in
 
03:20:37.429 --> 03:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
2025 we don't want to go too
 
03:20:41.469 --> 03:20:41.479 align:start position:0%
high um I'm thinking we ought to do
 
03:20:44.070 --> 03:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
13 in
 
03:20:50.110 --> 03:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:53.070 --> 03:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
1.12 and in
 
03:20:53.080 --> 03:21:05.150 align:start position:0%
1.12 and in
27

03:21:05.150 --> 03:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:10.750 --> 03:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
1.20 what was 26 again 25 I had I
 
03:21:10.760 --> 03:21:14.349 align:start position:0%
1.20 what was 26 again 25 I had I
have3

03:21:14.349 --> 03:21:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:18.229 --> 03:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
26120 271 1
 
03:21:18.239 --> 03:21:21.229 align:start position:0%
26120 271 1
120

03:21:21.229 --> 03:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
120
 
03:21:24.469 --> 03:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
yeah represent yeah thanks you talk
 
03:21:27.870 --> 03:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
about the percent the percent increases
 
03:21:30.030 --> 03:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
over that Baseline so I could get a
 
03:21:33.030 --> 03:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
better reference I I did not do it on a
 
03:21:36.110 --> 03:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
percentage basis I did it looking at the
 
03:21:39.189 --> 03:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
refunds that we've been talking about
 
03:21:41.790 --> 03:21:41.800 align:start position:0%
and the uh interest and
 
03:21:44.950 --> 03:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
dividends and the way uh I've seen the
 
03:21:47.510 --> 03:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
economy rolling uh watching the stock
 
03:21:50.510 --> 03:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
market as I have recently when the news
 
03:21:52.550 --> 03:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
is good the Market's greened when the
 
03:21:56.469 --> 03:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
news has been bad the market turns and
 
03:21:58.670 --> 03:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
the news is going to be good I mean this
 
03:21:59.950 --> 03:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
is going to
 
03:22:03.150 --> 03:22:03.160 align:start position:0%
be I think it's going to be amazing uh
 
03:22:05.590 --> 03:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
period of time for the next couple
 
03:22:08.670 --> 03:22:08.680 align:start position:0%
years and I can't imagine what the years
 
03:22:10.790 --> 03:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
three and four will look like
 
03:22:13.510 --> 03:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
but um you know when I looked at the
 
03:22:13.520 --> 03:22:15.030 align:start position:0%
but um you know when I looked at the
charts

03:22:15.030 --> 03:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
charts
 
03:22:17.590 --> 03:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
recently the
 
03:22:20.710 --> 03:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
the take-home effect which has a lot to
 
03:22:22.429 --> 03:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
do with the
 
03:22:25.950 --> 03:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
economy and wrong glasses sorry about
 
03:22:28.670 --> 03:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
that and when I looked at the
 
03:22:31.590 --> 03:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
charts it would look like that under
 
03:22:34.269 --> 03:22:34.279 align:start position:0%
Trump with people having more money to
 
03:22:36.429 --> 03:22:36.439 align:start position:0%
spend people having more money to spend
 
03:22:38.990 --> 03:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
means more money on meals and rooms and
 
03:22:41.229 --> 03:22:41.239 align:start position:0%
rentals and vacations and all
 
03:22:44.910 --> 03:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
that the last four years with Biden look
 
03:22:47.389 --> 03:22:47.399 align:start position:0%
like that that's the money that people
 
03:22:50.870 --> 03:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
did not have to spend and so I believe
 
03:22:52.830 --> 03:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
with President Trump the current
 
03:22:56.510 --> 03:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
administration's agenda of
 
03:22:56.520 --> 03:22:58.150 align:start position:0%
administration's agenda of
drilling

03:22:58.150 --> 03:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
drilling
 
03:23:00.870 --> 03:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
and what the things we're already seeing
 
03:23:03.750 --> 03:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
the money that they're already showing
 
03:23:06.150 --> 03:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
that's been misspent we're talking
 
03:23:10.110 --> 03:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
Millions if if they break two trillion I
 
03:23:11.710 --> 03:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
I would be shocked I don't think it'll
 
03:23:13.030 --> 03:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
be that high but I think we're
 
03:23:14.910 --> 03:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
definitely going to see uh they're going
 
03:23:16.710 --> 03:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
to they're going to shake out over a
 
03:23:19.189 --> 03:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
trillion dollars and we're going to see
 
03:23:21.309 --> 03:23:21.319 align:start position:0%
this economy
 
03:23:24.110 --> 03:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
boom energy drives the world we've
 
03:23:26.349 --> 03:23:26.359 align:start position:0%
already learned that green energy is
 
03:23:29.030 --> 03:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
failing these windmills they you know
 
03:23:31.030 --> 03:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
people forget they run on oil they run
 
03:23:34.349 --> 03:23:34.359 align:start position:0%
on diesel they need diesel engines to
 
03:23:36.429 --> 03:23:36.439 align:start position:0%
start the blades are so big the these
 
03:23:38.790 --> 03:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
wind turbines just don't turn on
 
03:23:41.830 --> 03:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
themselves and we've seen where the wind
 
03:23:43.990 --> 03:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
turbines are coming apart the Coatings
 
03:23:45.590 --> 03:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
are coming off they're affecting our
 
03:23:45.600 --> 03:23:47.550 align:start position:0%
are coming off they're affecting our
beaches

03:23:47.550 --> 03:23:47.560 align:start position:0%
beaches
 
03:23:50.670 --> 03:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
uh green energy is not the way we go
 
03:23:52.830 --> 03:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
we've already seen it in Europe Germany
 
03:23:55.670 --> 03:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
is taking a beating and it's going to
 
03:23:58.429 --> 03:23:58.439 align:start position:0%
continue and the way to go is clean
 
03:24:00.389 --> 03:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
energy I agree clean it's but it's
 
03:24:05.830 --> 03:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
called nuclear and if Google and AI are
 
03:24:08.229 --> 03:24:08.239 align:start position:0%
buying places like and looking to buy
 
03:24:11.590 --> 03:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
more threemile Island after all these
 
03:24:15.349 --> 03:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
years I worked within 30 minutes of
 
03:24:17.590 --> 03:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
Three Mile Island it didn't concern me
 
03:24:20.429 --> 03:24:20.439 align:start position:0%
then it doesn't concern me now obviously
 
03:24:23.910 --> 03:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't concern them with the future
 
03:24:27.229 --> 03:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
and energy the requirements that we are
 
03:24:29.189 --> 03:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
going to need to move our economy
 
03:24:32.030 --> 03:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
forward we are going nuclear whether
 
03:24:34.910 --> 03:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
people like it or not and right now we
 
03:24:37.910 --> 03:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
have the fossil fuels to move this
 
03:24:40.510 --> 03:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
country forward until that stuff comes
 
03:24:42.910 --> 03:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
online and I think we're going to see
 
03:24:45.389 --> 03:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
this this is going to be the next four
 
03:24:47.950 --> 03:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
years are going to be amazing I mean I'm
 
03:24:50.469 --> 03:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
already starting to see I'm starting to
 
03:24:52.429 --> 03:24:52.439 align:start position:0%
see it in the grocery stores a little
 
03:24:54.910 --> 03:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
bit I'm seeing it at the pump as I
 
03:24:56.510 --> 03:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned it the other day where I'm
 
03:24:59.710 --> 03:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
buying my gas it's down 6 cents I looked
 
03:25:02.429 --> 03:25:02.439 align:start position:0%
at my numbers for the last few years for
 
03:25:05.550 --> 03:25:05.560 align:start position:0%
fuel oil and the trend was up and now
 
03:25:09.150 --> 03:25:09.160 align:start position:0%
the trend is down and I'm excited for
 
03:25:11.550 --> 03:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
the next four
 
03:25:14.750 --> 03:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
years thank you representative
 
03:25:18.510 --> 03:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
opal um I was just looking at a report
 
03:25:20.309 --> 03:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
from The Joint economic committee issued
 
03:25:20.319 --> 03:25:21.150 align:start position:0%
from The Joint economic committee issued
by

03:25:21.150 --> 03:25:21.160 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:25:24.110 --> 03:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
Congress and um the national average for
 
03:25:26.630 --> 03:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
wages and salaries grew by nearly
 
03:25:29.150 --> 03:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
$16,700 since
 
03:25:33.070 --> 03:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
2021 outpacing price growth inflation by
 
03:25:35.550 --> 03:25:35.560 align:start position:0%
that uh during that period by
 
03:25:41.189 --> 03:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
$3,800 so just a a point of of you know
 
03:25:43.870 --> 03:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
statistic that actually wages grew in
 
03:25:45.429 --> 03:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
the last four years I don't know what
 
03:25:46.590 --> 03:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to do in the next four
 
03:25:47.870 --> 03:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
years maybe they'll grow maybe they
 
03:25:49.710 --> 03:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
won't but at least in the last four
 
03:25:53.070 --> 03:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
years we had to work on on facts yeah
 
03:25:54.910 --> 03:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
wages are growing this is we're not I'm
 
03:25:57.950 --> 03:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
not wait wait it's not a debate oh no
 
03:25:59.269 --> 03:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
thought thought we're having a
 
03:26:01.189 --> 03:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
discussion okay no it's a discussion but
 
03:26:03.309 --> 03:26:03.319 align:start position:0%
I have to call I have representative I
 
03:26:05.070 --> 03:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
have to call on I have to call on you
 
03:26:07.309 --> 03:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
before you
 
03:26:09.309 --> 03:26:09.319 align:start position:0%
respond now would you like to respond
 
03:26:11.229 --> 03:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman
 
03:26:13.510 --> 03:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
sorry about that I was just trying to
 
03:26:15.790 --> 03:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
have a discussion I agree with you the
 
03:26:18.990 --> 03:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
Wes have gone up but prices have gone up
 
03:26:21.630 --> 03:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
a lot higher a lot quicker a lot further
 
03:26:23.630 --> 03:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
you know the we were told the inflation
 
03:26:26.070 --> 03:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
was transitional it hasn't been trans
 
03:26:27.950 --> 03:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
transitional whatever that means nobody
 
03:26:29.429 --> 03:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
knows what that means yet I don't know
 
03:26:32.269 --> 03:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
what it means but I do know when I went
 
03:26:35.269 --> 03:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
to the grocery store and I buy a box of
 
03:26:37.750 --> 03:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
groceries that was that big for $3 and I
 
03:26:39.950 --> 03:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
buy the same box today it's
 
03:26:42.950 --> 03:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
$4 I'm expecting that same box is going
 
03:26:45.790 --> 03:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
to be 250 soon or the the quantity is
 
03:26:48.630 --> 03:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
going to grow again so I do agree
 
03:26:51.309 --> 03:26:51.319 align:start position:0%
representative opal wages have grown but
 
03:26:53.070 --> 03:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
inflation's a hell of a lot higher than
 
03:26:54.630 --> 03:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
they've been telling
 
03:26:59.189 --> 03:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
us okay um representative Southworth H
 
03:27:01.830 --> 03:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I had a question for
 
03:27:04.590 --> 03:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
Dr I tried to ask for Chris and he said
 
03:27:07.790 --> 03:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
it really was in your area
 
03:27:09.910 --> 03:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
umic oh
 
03:27:13.790 --> 03:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
sorry um I just wondered on your high
 
03:27:15.950 --> 03:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
estimate maybe you could tell me some of
 
03:27:19.990 --> 03:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
the positives you anticipated um to come
 
03:27:22.309 --> 03:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
up with the high estimate I kind of know
 
03:27:23.870 --> 03:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
the negatives the reason we're looking
 
03:27:26.750 --> 03:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
at the low end what did you see um that
 
03:27:31.990 --> 03:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:33.870 --> 03:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
highend uh thank you representative
 
03:27:36.830 --> 03:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
Southworth um so the commissioner spoke
 
03:27:40.790 --> 03:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
to these estimates yesterday and um her
 
03:27:43.550 --> 03:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh way of arriving at the range of 3 to
 
03:27:47.550 --> 03:27:47.560 align:start position:0%
8% was to look at the past history of
 
03:27:50.309 --> 03:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
the growth of the tax and she kind of
 
03:27:52.309 --> 03:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
eliminated some of the highest highs and
 
03:27:53.950 --> 03:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
the lowest lows and looked at the middle
 
03:27:56.710 --> 03:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
of the range and the 8% was kind of the
 
03:27:58.469 --> 03:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
most optimistic number she could use
 
03:28:00.830 --> 03:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
when she looked at those uh rates of
 
03:28:04.030 --> 03:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
past growth followup followup so it
 
03:28:05.950 --> 03:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
really wasn't based on thinking certain
 
03:28:07.189 --> 03:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
things were going to happen in the
 
03:28:09.309 --> 03:28:09.319 align:start position:0%
future no at all there was not an
 
03:28:12.269 --> 03:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
analysis of say um a particular segment
 
03:28:13.710 --> 03:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
of the economy or anything like that it
 
03:28:15.630 --> 03:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
was just based on past historic which
 
03:28:16.670 --> 03:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
we've done in the
 
03:28:18.429 --> 03:28:18.439 align:start position:0%
right but I was just curious so there
 
03:28:20.469 --> 03:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
wasn't someone said a silver bullet that
 
03:28:22.950 --> 03:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
you guys saw that tilted you towards the
 
03:28:25.229 --> 03:28:25.239 align:start position:0%
high it was no thank you that really
 
03:28:25.239 --> 03:28:28.630 align:start position:0%
high it was no thank you that really
helps

03:28:28.630 --> 03:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:31.910 --> 03:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
sure other thoughts representative elme
 
03:28:35.670 --> 03:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
yes uh when was were were you looking at
 
03:28:40.070 --> 03:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
the past 10 years or or what because the
 
03:28:56.269 --> 03:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:59.309 --> 03:28:59.319 align:start position:0%
um I I think several of those last four
 
03:29:01.429 --> 03:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
years were some of the highs that were
 
03:29:04.670 --> 03:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
eliminated under her
 
03:29:07.510 --> 03:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
analysis yeah
 
03:29:10.309 --> 03:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
said I think she looked
 
03:29:13.830 --> 03:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
back I'm going to say three or four
 
03:29:16.630 --> 03:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
years prior to covid
 
03:29:20.349 --> 03:29:20.359 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah uh so about to 16 I think
 
03:29:24.710 --> 03:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
that's about right it sounds
 
03:29:28.790 --> 03:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
right I guess before 16 you end up with
 
03:29:31.150 --> 03:29:31.160 align:start position:0%
the aftermath of the Great
 
03:29:33.510 --> 03:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
Recession which being a great recession
 
03:29:39.309 --> 03:29:39.319 align:start position:0%
took a great long time to finish
 
03:29:39.319 --> 03:29:43.950 align:start position:0%
took a great long time to finish
true

03:29:43.950 --> 03:29:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:46.870 --> 03:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
thanks other thoughts on where these
 
03:29:52.790 --> 03:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:57.229 --> 03:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
up so R and yeah my thought is uh I
 
03:29:58.990 --> 03:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
think the long-term trend lines are
 
03:30:01.030 --> 03:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
pretty important here uh we're going to
 
03:30:03.150 --> 03:30:03.160 align:start position:0%
have ups and downs due to oil
 
03:30:05.870 --> 03:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
surprises whatever but I think the
 
03:30:07.710 --> 03:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
long-term trends been fairly steady at
 
03:30:11.030 --> 03:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
this uh 2 and a half% growth rate and
 
03:30:13.429 --> 03:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
I've inclined to take what we've got and
 
03:30:14.630 --> 03:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
look at that kind of a number going
 
03:30:14.640 --> 03:30:16.830 align:start position:0%
look at that kind of a number going
forward

03:30:16.830 --> 03:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
forward
 
03:30:19.030 --> 03:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
well okay so specifically what are you
 
03:30:19.040 --> 03:30:21.510 align:start position:0%
well okay so specifically what are you
talking

03:30:21.510 --> 03:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:25.349 --> 03:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
about not for a number oh yeah I'm I'm
 
03:30:26.710 --> 03:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
just I don't have a number in mind
 
03:30:28.110 --> 03:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
because I haven't done the calculation
 
03:30:30.389 --> 03:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
well no well in the sense that um I
 
03:30:32.309 --> 03:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
think what has been thrown out so far
 
03:30:36.510 --> 03:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
was uh uh who was it representative ORS
 
03:30:39.349 --> 03:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
did you put the numbers out um yeah I
 
03:30:40.510 --> 03:30:40.520 align:start position:0%
why don't you to repeat the numbers that
 
03:30:44.389 --> 03:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
you put out so far okay thank you Mr
 
03:30:47.710 --> 03:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
chair so the numbers I put out for
 
03:30:47.720 --> 03:30:50.550 align:start position:0%
chair so the numbers I put out for
2025

03:30:50.550 --> 03:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
2025
 
03:30:54.950 --> 03:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:03.389 --> 03:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:09.510 --> 03:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
1.2 okay so given that represent om
 
03:31:12.110 --> 03:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
um where are you where are you in this
 
03:31:15.670 --> 03:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I concur with the uh with the 2025
 
03:31:19.790 --> 03:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
number 1 Point uh 03 03 right and that's
 
03:31:21.590 --> 03:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
based on the analysis I'm looking at
 
03:31:24.349 --> 03:31:24.359 align:start position:0%
that says growth in 25 was a little less
 
03:31:26.950 --> 03:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
than grow than 24 and it's likely to go
 
03:31:30.269 --> 03:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
up to more traditional levels after 2025
 
03:31:31.870 --> 03:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
so I that's so I think that's a good
 
03:31:31.880 --> 03:31:35.790 align:start position:0%
so I that's so I think that's a good
starting

03:31:35.790 --> 03:31:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:39.349 --> 03:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
point okay so for 2026
 
03:31:41.670 --> 03:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
1.12 is
 
03:31:49.150 --> 03:31:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:51.189 --> 03:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
90 no
 
03:31:56.550 --> 03:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
1.1 so the low on 2026 is
 
03:32:00.229 --> 03:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
1.06 so represent ORS is saying 1.12
 
03:32:03.790 --> 03:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
which is 60 million higher so it's a
 
03:32:05.630 --> 03:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
it's a growth of 60
 
03:32:05.640 --> 03:32:08.269 align:start position:0%
it's a growth of 60
million

03:32:08.269 --> 03:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:32:11.389 --> 03:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
um and then so forth for 2027 which
 
03:32:11.399 --> 03:32:13.830 align:start position:0%
um and then so forth for 2027 which
would

03:32:13.830 --> 03:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:15.950 --> 03:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
be no I'm sorry I was looking at the
 
03:32:17.830 --> 03:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
wrong number It's one oh no no it wasn't
 
03:32:21.750 --> 03:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
1.12 okay no that was right okay and one
 
03:32:24.309 --> 03:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
point and you're 1.2 you're kind of kind
 
03:32:28.469 --> 03:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
of in the middle uh of the range in
 
03:32:34.910 --> 03:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:37.389 --> 03:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
a uh microphone
 
03:32:41.990 --> 03:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
please it looks to me like
 
03:32:49.469 --> 03:32:49.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:19.870 --> 03:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:22.150 --> 03:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
1.12 I get
 
03:33:26.070 --> 03:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
8.7 yes that's what I
 
03:33:29.950 --> 03:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
got that seems pretty high for a year we
 
03:33:31.429 --> 03:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
thought was going to be
 
03:33:31.439 --> 03:33:32.950 align:start position:0%
thought was going to be
transitional

03:33:32.950 --> 03:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
transitional
 
03:33:47.630 --> 03:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:50.429 --> 03:33:50.439 align:start position:0%
okay so that yeah that that's that's
 
03:33:59.150 --> 03:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:02.150 --> 03:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman it's probably optimistic
 
03:34:05.070 --> 03:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
yeah yes I I think that 8% gross a
 
03:34:07.830 --> 03:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
little on the high side and uh I I I
 
03:34:10.469 --> 03:34:10.479 align:start position:0%
don't think that's realistic yeah what
 
03:34:13.510 --> 03:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
do you think is realistic I I I think
 
03:34:17.150 --> 03:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
probably more like 5% might be more
 
03:34:21.389 --> 03:34:21.399 align:start position:0%
realistic over 5% over that first number
 
03:34:22.590 --> 03:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
I mean because because we can think
 
03:34:25.469 --> 03:34:25.479 align:start position:0%
about the economy in general a 5% growth
 
03:34:29.630 --> 03:34:29.640 align:start position:0%
in in GDP is really high so probably
 
03:34:31.189 --> 03:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
it's going to be closer to
 
03:34:37.110 --> 03:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:40.870 --> 03:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
half you were right take us a while to
 
03:34:48.030 --> 03:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:51.349 --> 03:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
represent yary you have a thought on
 
03:34:54.269 --> 03:34:54.279 align:start position:0%
that no 8%
 
03:34:56.469 --> 03:34:56.479 align:start position:0%
High uh no what do you about think about
 
03:34:59.990 --> 03:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
3% that's yeah two and a half to
 
03:35:03.510 --> 03:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
3% it seems to be the trend for the
 
03:35:06.189 --> 03:35:06.199 align:start position:0%
GDP uh for the last several years even
 
03:35:08.309 --> 03:35:08.319 align:start position:0%
though the inflation rate has
 
03:35:10.030 --> 03:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
been kind
 
03:35:13.110 --> 03:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
of messing up the works as far as money
 
03:35:15.750 --> 03:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
available but yeah we'll do it that way
 
03:35:17.309 --> 03:35:17.319 align:start position:0%
yeah and and representative Wars in
 
03:35:19.790 --> 03:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
general I don't disagree
 
03:35:23.389 --> 03:35:23.399 align:start position:0%
with growth that's coming but I think
 
03:35:25.950 --> 03:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
it's when is it actually coming is the
 
03:35:29.030 --> 03:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
question and will it be here in 26 it'll
 
03:35:31.269 --> 03:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
start but I think it's it's a slow
 
03:35:36.910 --> 03:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
moving ship um so if we do oh I don't
 
03:35:39.349 --> 03:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
Trump is a slow moving ship I'm talking
 
03:35:42.910 --> 03:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
about the the effect the
 
03:35:45.750 --> 03:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
effect okay
 
03:35:47.790 --> 03:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to let's just see what so if
 
03:35:50.110 --> 03:35:50.120 align:start position:0%
we go with representative or's initial
 
03:35:50.120 --> 03:35:51.349 align:start position:0%
we go with representative or's initial
of

03:35:51.349 --> 03:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:35:54.469 --> 03:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
1.03 and then we multiply by
 
03:35:59.150 --> 03:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:04.189 --> 03:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
four save this 1.06 09 it's did somebody
 
03:36:07.309 --> 03:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
say 1.07 are you going to propose two
 
03:36:09.790 --> 03:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:17.429 --> 03:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:20.550 --> 03:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
okay representative duet thank you and
 
03:36:24.269 --> 03:36:24.279 align:start position:0%
and I I agree but maybe we can tier it a
 
03:36:26.469 --> 03:36:26.479 align:start position:0%
little differently that's why I suggest
 
03:36:30.870 --> 03:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
the uh 2.5 based on where GDP has been
 
03:36:34.590 --> 03:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
so conservatively I'd stay at the 2.5
 
03:36:36.389 --> 03:36:36.399 align:start position:0%
and if you're suggesting three I might
 
03:36:38.309 --> 03:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
be able to get there but maybe we can go
 
03:36:40.229 --> 03:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
to four in
 
03:36:43.630 --> 03:36:43.640 align:start position:0%
2017 looking forward okay let's see what
 
03:36:46.030 --> 03:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
I'm more comfortable right at that GDP
 
03:36:48.309 --> 03:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
line all right it's going to take some
 
03:36:51.469 --> 03:36:51.479 align:start position:0%
time and there may maybe
 
03:36:56.110 --> 03:36:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:59.670 --> 03:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
yeah let's see what uh if we we start
 
03:37:01.790 --> 03:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
with 1.03 and we
 
03:37:01.800 --> 03:37:03.309 align:start position:0%
with 1.03 and we
multiply

03:37:03.309 --> 03:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
multiply
 
03:37:03.319 --> 03:37:08.550 align:start position:0%
multiply
2.5%

03:37:08.550 --> 03:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:10.990 --> 03:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
.025 no that's not
 
03:37:14.110 --> 03:37:14.120 align:start position:0%
right one point it's got to do one it's
 
03:37:18.830 --> 03:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:27.910 --> 03:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:31.590 --> 03:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
1.06 which is just like their
 
03:37:36.790 --> 03:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
low uh their low is oh that is their low
 
03:37:40.550 --> 03:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
okay all right so I think it's a
 
03:37:43.469 --> 03:37:43.479 align:start position:0%
winner maybe we should just maybe we
 
03:37:46.990 --> 03:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
should just stick with the low
 
03:37:49.990 --> 03:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
too low my humble
 
03:37:52.790 --> 03:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
opinion yeah but we can blame
 
03:37:55.189 --> 03:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
somebody well I'm go I'm I'm okay with
 
03:37:57.429 --> 03:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
changing 1.29 to
 
03:38:01.030 --> 03:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
1.03 I'm sorry I didn't get Jordan's
 
03:38:01.040 --> 03:38:03.349 align:start position:0%
1.03 I'm sorry I didn't get Jordan's
comment

03:38:03.349 --> 03:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
comment
 
03:38:10.389 --> 03:38:10.399 align:start position:0%
uh so let's say we we we take uh row
 
03:38:14.550 --> 03:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
9ine uh and but make it 1.03 and then
 
03:38:14.560 --> 03:38:16.030 align:start position:0%
9ine uh and but make it 1.03 and then
row

03:38:16.030 --> 03:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
row
 
03:38:21.870 --> 03:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:26.469 --> 03:38:26.479 align:start position:0%
1.06 no one row 11 would be 1.03 row 16
 
03:38:31.309 --> 03:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
would be 1.06 right
 
03:38:33.309 --> 03:38:33.319 align:start position:0%
14 oh you're right I was on the wrong
 
03:38:39.870 --> 03:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:41.990 --> 03:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
1.03 and then
 
03:38:47.189 --> 03:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:49.110 --> 03:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
and then what is and then now let's
 
03:38:54.150 --> 03:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:58.269 --> 03:38:58.279 align:start position:0%
21 no well the reason we're going what
 
03:39:02.469 --> 03:39:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:02.479 --> 03:39:07.830 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:39:07.830 --> 03:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:12.070 --> 03:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so now for 1.06 Mr chairman yeah um
 
03:39:15.070 --> 03:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
if my math is right if you use the 1.06
 
03:39:16.309 --> 03:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
for fiscal
 
03:39:18.910 --> 03:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
26 and at I think representative duette
 
03:39:20.269 --> 03:39:20.279 align:start position:0%
said he thought
 
03:39:24.910 --> 03:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
4% growth in 27 four four is a bit more
 
03:39:26.910 --> 03:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
optimistic I think and I think we'll be
 
03:39:28.870 --> 03:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
positioned for that yeah I would agree
 
03:39:32.590 --> 03:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
four that would get you to 1.1 yeah
 
03:39:38.030 --> 03:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:42.590 --> 03:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
1.1 okay yeah the these no one point
 
03:39:50.349 --> 03:39:50.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:54.150 --> 03:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
1.1 just a little bit above their the Dr
 
03:39:54.160 --> 03:39:55.870 align:start position:0%
1.1 just a little bit above their the Dr
low

03:39:55.870 --> 03:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
low
 
03:40:01.389 --> 03:40:01.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:04.790 --> 03:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
um let's talk about Fuller Fuller
 
03:40:06.469 --> 03:40:06.479 align:start position:0%
numbers here
 
03:40:10.070 --> 03:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
so so basically
 
03:40:10.080 --> 03:40:11.630 align:start position:0%
so so basically
25

03:40:11.630 --> 03:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
25
 
03:40:19.309 --> 03:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:22.870 --> 03:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
comma Z3 y
 
03:40:22.880 --> 03:40:24.510 align:start position:0%
comma Z3 y
zero

03:40:24.510 --> 03:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
zero
 
03:40:31.550 --> 03:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:33.750 --> 03:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
060 and
 
03:40:40.950 --> 03:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:46.790 --> 03:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:50.389 --> 03:40:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:54.590 --> 03:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
that's the these are estimates what2 no
 
03:40:59.870 --> 03:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
that the line 21 the 4% growth over one
 
03:41:05.910 --> 03:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
106 was one one Z24 so 24 doesn't round
 
03:41:09.870 --> 03:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
up so it should be 1 comma one
 
03:41:16.590 --> 03:41:16.600 align:start position:0%
z z zero yeah one comma one z z zero
 
03:41:18.150 --> 03:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
we're going out we're going out four
 
03:41:23.389 --> 03:41:23.399 align:start position:0%
places so it's so one comma 1 0 0 yeah
 
03:41:23.399 --> 03:41:25.349 align:start position:0%
places so it's so one comma 1 0 0 yeah
right

03:41:25.349 --> 03:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:41:27.790 --> 03:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
yeah but what is the two that's two
 
03:41:28.830 --> 03:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
that's two
 
03:41:32.550 --> 03:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
million yeah okay
 
03:41:35.149 --> 03:41:35.159 align:start position:0%
27 yeah I'm just saying do do we get to
 
03:41:42.630 --> 03:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:42.640 --> 03:41:44.229 align:start position:0%
 
of

03:41:44.229 --> 03:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:41:44.239 --> 03:41:45.910 align:start position:0%
of
what

03:41:45.910 --> 03:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:41:45.920 --> 03:41:48.070 align:start position:0%
what
was

03:41:48.070 --> 03:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:41:51.910 --> 03:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
1024 yeah the four is out the four is
 
03:41:54.269 --> 03:41:54.279 align:start position:0%
out okay we can do that there's another
 
03:41:57.389 --> 03:41:57.399 align:start position:0%
zero in there that she's missing one one
 
03:42:00.910 --> 03:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
Z2 right yeah no that's what she said
 
03:42:03.910 --> 03:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chairman yeah I I'm just curious
 
03:42:06.070 --> 03:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
because we got that one uh why wouldn't
 
03:42:09.110 --> 03:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
um why wouldn't we just go with the 26
 
03:42:14.149 --> 03:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:14.159 --> 03:42:16.309 align:start position:0%
 
1.06

03:42:16.309 --> 03:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
1.06
 
03:42:18.990 --> 03:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
full that I mean it's a little higher
 
03:42:20.469 --> 03:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
well because you're talking about 400
 
03:42:22.830 --> 03:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
thou I don't know it's that level of
 
03:42:22.840 --> 03:42:24.590 align:start position:0%
thou I don't know it's that level of
accuracy

03:42:24.590 --> 03:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
accuracy
 
03:42:26.870 --> 03:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's given this given this is an
 
03:42:31.269 --> 03:42:31.279 align:start position:0%
estimate yeah that's I think not
 
03:42:33.189 --> 03:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
significant every number here should
 
03:42:36.349 --> 03:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:39.510 --> 03:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
of so the the only advantage of going to
 
03:42:41.469 --> 03:42:41.479 align:start position:0%
the point4 is that Finance would find a
 
03:42:43.950 --> 03:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
way to work it into the budget if needed
 
03:42:43.960 --> 03:42:46.309 align:start position:0%
way to work it into the budget if needed
yeah

03:42:46.309 --> 03:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:42:47.950 --> 03:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
no it's a good it's it's a reasonable
 
03:42:47.960 --> 03:42:53.790 align:start position:0%
no it's a good it's it's a reasonable
Point

03:42:53.790 --> 03:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:57.269 --> 03:42:57.279 align:start position:0%
yeah one Z2 yes
 
03:43:03.189 --> 03:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
yes so TW line uh okay line 21 is
 
03:43:03.199 --> 03:43:04.710 align:start position:0%
yes so TW line uh okay line 21 is
1102

03:43:04.710 --> 03:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
1102
 
03:43:09.590 --> 03:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:13.790 --> 03:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
1060 and line 11 is
 
03:43:20.469 --> 03:43:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:24.750 --> 03:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
Wars um so given those numbers any
 
03:43:35.309 --> 03:43:35.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:37.870 --> 03:43:37.880 align:start position:0%
whether million bucks to
 
03:43:40.910 --> 03:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
Finance on the fourth yeah on 27 we gave
 
03:43:43.149 --> 03:43:43.159 align:start position:0%
him an extra 2 million
 
03:43:47.030 --> 03:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
I oh represent I know I know it just
 
03:43:50.389 --> 03:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
Fades um I'd just say in terms of my
 
03:43:53.429 --> 03:43:53.439 align:start position:0%
personal opinion I think 2027 could go
 
03:43:55.149 --> 03:43:55.159 align:start position:0%
up or down I mean I think that's going
 
03:43:56.590 --> 03:43:56.600 align:start position:0%
to be year that either things are going
 
03:43:58.550 --> 03:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
to get better or they're going to get
 
03:44:02.469 --> 03:44:02.479 align:start position:0%
worse but I'm glad to be wrong so well
 
03:44:04.110 --> 03:44:04.120 align:start position:0%
there's there's no doubt the further we
 
03:44:07.349 --> 03:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
further we go out with anything uh the
 
03:44:08.910 --> 03:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
further off we're going to
 
03:44:11.229 --> 03:44:11.239 align:start position:0%
be and if you're yeah I always think of
 
03:44:13.070 --> 03:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
the the analogy of if you're shooting at
 
03:44:17.510 --> 03:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
a bullseye and the further back you go
 
03:44:20.510 --> 03:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
the the slighter the the change that
 
03:44:24.469 --> 03:44:24.479 align:start position:0%
will mess it up so um I think
 
03:44:27.469 --> 03:44:27.479 align:start position:0%
we're yeah we're just doing the best we
 
03:44:30.389 --> 03:44:30.399 align:start position:0%
can okay all right if there's no further
 
03:44:31.670 --> 03:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
discussion with someone like to make a
 
03:44:33.910 --> 03:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
motion on these
 
03:44:37.950 --> 03:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
numbers all right tney second by
 
03:44:46.469 --> 03:44:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:48.469 --> 03:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
all right all in favor please designate
 
03:44:50.189 --> 03:44:50.199 align:start position:0%

03:44:52.550 --> 03:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
hand represent shamberg you I don't see
 
03:44:52.560 --> 03:44:54.910 align:start position:0%
hand represent shamberg you I don't see
your

03:44:54.910 --> 03:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:57.750 --> 03:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
hand all right he's afraid all right all
 
03:44:57.760 --> 03:44:59.830 align:start position:0%

those
 
03:45:02.269 --> 03:45:02.279 align:start position:0%
against so one again so what is the
 
03:45:04.269 --> 03:45:04.279 align:start position:0%
total one two
 
03:45:12.189 --> 03:45:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:16.070 --> 03:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
1 hey I'm a team player I raised my hand
 
03:45:17.710 --> 03:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
I I just want to congratulate the
 
03:45:20.550 --> 03:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
committee I I wondered whether we could
 
03:45:23.910 --> 03:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
get it done uh today this is uh you know
 
03:45:25.710 --> 03:45:25.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of lot of good work and a lot of
 
03:45:28.790 --> 03:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
good thought went into this um because I
 
03:45:30.990 --> 03:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
was originally planning on the 19th to
 
03:45:33.710 --> 03:45:33.720 align:start position:0%
to finish up anything we hadn't done now
 
03:45:36.309 --> 03:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
what we'll end up doing on the 19th is
 
03:45:38.149 --> 03:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh Chris will put together well first
 
03:45:40.910 --> 03:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
first you're going to put together a new
 
03:45:43.189 --> 03:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet for us with updated on what
 
03:45:46.389 --> 03:45:46.399 align:start position:0%
we talked about today so the the next
 
03:45:47.990 --> 03:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet you'll see will have all the
 
03:45:49.389 --> 03:45:49.399 align:start position:0%
splits in it for the education trust
 
03:45:51.830 --> 03:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
fund and the general fund so that'll be
 
03:45:54.149 --> 03:45:54.159 align:start position:0%
presented uh I think tomorrow afternoon
 
03:45:57.550 --> 03:45:57.560 align:start position:0%
after you're done your uh Bill work and
 
03:46:00.269 --> 03:46:00.279 align:start position:0%
um from there I we'll have a house
 
03:46:02.269 --> 03:46:02.279 align:start position:0%
resolution drafted and I'll provide that
 
03:46:04.910 --> 03:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
to the chair and then at the 19th I
 
03:46:07.870 --> 03:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
think he wants to um review that get the
 
03:46:09.030 --> 03:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
blessing of the committee and then it
 
03:46:10.630 --> 03:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
would go to the clerk to be worked into
 
03:46:13.070 --> 03:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
the calendar yeah so what I'm planning
 
03:46:16.389 --> 03:46:16.399 align:start position:0%
for next week is um um only having a
 
03:46:20.510 --> 03:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
meeting on Wednesday the 19th um at
 
03:46:21.790 --> 03:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
starting at 10
 
03:46:24.229 --> 03:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
o'clock Chris we'll have the resolution
 
03:46:25.950 --> 03:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
so we'll vote on the resolution which
 
03:46:27.590 --> 03:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
will be presented to the to the Full
 
03:46:27.600 --> 03:46:28.510 align:start position:0%
will be presented to the to the Full
House

03:46:28.510 --> 03:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
House
 
03:46:32.429 --> 03:46:32.439 align:start position:0%
on whenever you know the next probably
 
03:46:36.910 --> 03:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
early March yeah and um but once we vote
 
03:46:39.630 --> 03:46:39.640 align:start position:0%
on it if Finance uh needs to see where
 
03:46:41.910 --> 03:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
we're at we can let them know um the
 
03:46:43.550 --> 03:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
other thing I I wanted to do originally
 
03:46:45.229 --> 03:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
I was planning on the 19th being
 
03:46:47.870 --> 03:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
finishing up what we just finished up
 
03:46:47.880 --> 03:46:50.149 align:start position:0%
finishing up what we just finished up
and

03:46:50.149 --> 03:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:46:52.590 --> 03:46:52.600 align:start position:0%
um you know may maybe executing
 
03:46:54.630 --> 03:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
something but now if we're if we've got
 
03:46:56.790 --> 03:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
the resolution barring any major change
 
03:47:00.870 --> 03:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
between now and next Wednesday um I'll
 
03:47:02.990 --> 03:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
see we may add a few extra things to
 
03:47:04.950 --> 03:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
exec in there a few extra bills maybe we
 
03:47:08.149 --> 03:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
can exec um the other thing is don't be
 
03:47:09.469 --> 03:47:09.479 align:start position:0%
surprised when you see that I'm also
 
03:47:12.070 --> 03:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
scheduling Friday it's not that I expect
 
03:47:14.229 --> 03:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
to come in Friday but if it snows on
 
03:47:15.550 --> 03:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
Wednesday I just want to make sure I
 
03:47:17.710 --> 03:47:17.720 align:start position:0%
have a backup plan so that our revenues
 
03:47:20.670 --> 03:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
get done next week because if we don't
 
03:47:22.590 --> 03:47:22.600 align:start position:0%
get them done next week the following
 
03:47:23.990 --> 03:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
week's vacation week which I already
 
03:47:26.469 --> 03:47:26.479 align:start position:0%
said we're taking off I I don't want to
 
03:47:29.030 --> 03:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
get these revenues out in March when
 
03:47:30.950 --> 03:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
we're ready to go so I'll so when you
 
03:47:32.630 --> 03:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
see it yes it'll be scheduled for
 
03:47:34.469 --> 03:47:34.479 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and Friday but we'll only be
 
03:47:35.750 --> 03:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
coming in one of those days and
 
03:47:37.149 --> 03:47:37.159 align:start position:0%
hopefully it's Wednesday and then I'll
 
03:47:40.710 --> 03:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
announce after that that Friday is
 
03:47:40.720 --> 03:47:42.389 align:start position:0%
announce after that that Friday is
canceled

03:47:42.389 --> 03:47:42.399 align:start position:0%
canceled
 
03:47:45.469 --> 03:47:45.479 align:start position:0%
so only one day next week no no days the
 
03:47:47.670 --> 03:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
next week this is you know we're we're
 
03:47:48.950 --> 03:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
very efficient in this committee and
 
03:47:52.229 --> 03:47:52.239 align:start position:0%
this is this is what happens um any
 
03:47:57.070 --> 03:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:59.790 --> 03:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
doing oh I said we are very efficient in
 
03:47:59.800 --> 03:48:00.870 align:start position:0%
doing oh I said we are very efficient in
this

03:48:00.870 --> 03:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:48:03.389 --> 03:48:03.399 align:start position:0%
committee we might be biased we might be
 
03:48:03.399 --> 03:48:07.229 align:start position:0%
committee we might be biased we might be
what's

03:48:07.229 --> 03:48:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:09.590 --> 03:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
that and maybe we're a little biased but
 
03:48:13.750 --> 03:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
you know so anyways um
 
03:48:16.389 --> 03:48:16.399 align:start position:0%
we thank you for the good work on this
 
03:48:18.670 --> 03:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
so now at 2:00 we have an exec session
 
03:48:21.070 --> 03:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm glad I scheduled for two and not
 
03:48:24.349 --> 03:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
three um we have our exec session at two
 
03:48:26.510 --> 03:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
we'll uh look at the four bills as
 
03:48:28.990 --> 03:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
listed and then we'll be done for today
 
03:48:32.429 --> 03:48:32.439 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we've got um public hearings on
 
03:48:35.830 --> 03:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
I think four bills uh will'll be done or
 
03:48:38.830 --> 03:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
the last public hearing is at 1 o' and
 
03:48:40.389 --> 03:48:40.399 align:start position:0%
uh Chris will be in the room so that as
 
03:48:42.189 --> 03:48:42.199 align:start position:0%
soon as that's finished he's going to
 
03:48:45.429 --> 03:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
give us the um uh the update on the
 
03:48:48.830 --> 03:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and we can just eyeball it
 
03:48:50.550 --> 03:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
quickly make sure we you know he didn't
 
03:48:52.389 --> 03:48:52.399 align:start position:0%
make any mistakes he never does make
 
03:48:54.950 --> 03:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
mistakes but there's always a first time
 
03:48:58.030 --> 03:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
uh and then uh oh there was that red
 
03:48:59.389 --> 03:48:59.399 align:start position:0%
herring earlier today where I didn't
 
03:49:02.349 --> 03:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
have the fiscal years on that Dr page
 
03:49:07.269 --> 03:49:07.279 align:start position:0%
so so um done deliberately to make sure
 
03:49:09.070 --> 03:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
everyone had the chance so that's the
 
03:49:11.429 --> 03:49:11.439 align:start position:0%
plan so uh we can break now and at one
 
03:49:13.710 --> 03:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
at 2 o'clock we'll come back and
 
03:49:13.720 --> 03:49:43.630 align:start position:0%

596 would you like to speak to your
 
04:05:31.229 --> 04:05:31.239 align:start position:0%
motion representative boards uh yes uh
 
04:05:33.110 --> 04:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
04:05:38.830 --> 04:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:38.840 --> 04:05:40.790 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:05:43.870 --> 04:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
so are we ready
 
04:05:54.910 --> 04:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:58.910 --> 04:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
yes so uh I believe that this is going
 
04:06:03.469 --> 04:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
to add additional cost to uh New
 
04:06:07.189 --> 04:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um in addition to that I
 
04:06:10.670 --> 04:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
think it's going to place a burden on
 
04:06:12.030 --> 04:06:12.040 align:start position:0%
our small
 
04:06:15.870 --> 04:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
towns particularly those with uh a few
 
04:06:17.469 --> 04:06:17.479 align:start position:0%
number of
 
04:06:19.950 --> 04:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
facilities uh we have
 
04:06:24.830 --> 04:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
a in place now if you have less than 10
 
04:06:27.590 --> 04:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
facilities uh you would be exposing
 
04:06:29.990 --> 04:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
yourself to your
 
04:06:32.349 --> 04:06:32.359 align:start position:0%
competition so we have a cost to the
 
04:06:34.710 --> 04:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
state we have cost to the small towns
 
04:06:37.630 --> 04:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
which is burdensome we have the exposure
 
04:06:40.550 --> 04:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
to our competition and of course then
 
04:06:42.590 --> 04:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
with that is the confidentiality our
 
04:06:45.030 --> 04:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
privacy which would be at risk and
 
04:06:47.269 --> 04:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
therefore that's why I am recommending
 
04:06:50.750 --> 04:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
we itl this legislation thank you Mr
 
04:06:54.349 --> 04:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you anybody else wish to
 
04:06:57.269 --> 04:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
speak on this representative
 
04:07:02.189 --> 04:07:02.199 align:start position:0%
elme thank you um this is a major
 
04:07:06.030 --> 04:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
problem for the urban hubs some of us uh
 
04:07:09.110 --> 04:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
are going to be voting our
 
04:07:15.149 --> 04:07:15.159 align:start position:0%
districts on this bill uh because on we
 
04:07:15.159 --> 04:07:16.910 align:start position:0%
districts on this bill uh because on we
are

04:07:16.910 --> 04:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:07:23.550 --> 04:07:23.560 align:start position:0%
much uh we lose a great deal by having
 
04:07:28.990 --> 04:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
these uh uh the restaurant and hotel
 
04:07:32.309 --> 04:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
money uh that we have to take care of in
 
04:07:34.710 --> 04:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
our districts and
 
04:07:38.990 --> 04:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
also uh uh the huge number of people who
 
04:07:40.990 --> 04:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
come in that require that we have two
 
04:07:43.710 --> 04:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
three times as many police and too many
 
04:07:45.790 --> 04:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
three times as many
 
04:07:50.349 --> 04:07:50.359 align:start position:0%
EMTs uh that we are paying for um
 
04:07:53.109 --> 04:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
whereas the bedroom communities do not
 
04:07:56.950 --> 04:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
have to pay for any of that so um it is
 
04:07:59.189 --> 04:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
a major problem it will continue to be a
 
04:08:02.229 --> 04:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
major problem it will continue to show
 
04:08:04.870 --> 04:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
up in one form or another and we were
 
04:08:08.790 --> 04:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
hoping to try to do a retain so that we
 
04:08:10.910 --> 04:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
could uh
 
04:08:14.710 --> 04:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
discuss other options that did not hurt
 
04:08:20.149 --> 04:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
the places that didn't have uh that were
 
04:08:21.469 --> 04:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
the bedroom
 
04:08:23.590 --> 04:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
communities or
 
04:08:29.109 --> 04:08:29.119 align:start position:0%

it
that

04:13:07.950 --> 04:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:13:11.910 --> 04:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
H sorry I'm behind here but it was
 
04:13:15.510 --> 04:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people who WR who
 
04:13:19.950 --> 04:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
online uh some of them afraid to come
 
04:13:22.309 --> 04:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
into the room
 
04:13:27.469 --> 04:13:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:30.910 --> 04:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
bill represent VY uh thank you
 
04:13:34.030 --> 04:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
representative Aly U start at the end uh
 
04:13:35.510 --> 04:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
if they're afraid to come into the room
 
04:13:38.990 --> 04:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
that's on them not on us uh the purpose
 
04:13:41.910 --> 04:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
of retention is because there are some
 
04:13:46.670 --> 04:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
entities as you and previous individuals
 
04:13:49.550 --> 04:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
involved including representative wer
 
04:13:54.109 --> 04:13:54.119 align:start position:0%
and have looked at this uh bit about non
 
04:13:57.070 --> 04:13:57.080 align:start position:0%
not for profits not being not for
 
04:14:00.189 --> 04:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
profits in the a variety of different
 
04:14:02.670 --> 04:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
ways over the years this just follows
 
04:14:06.590 --> 04:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
the same general principle that has been
 
04:14:09.149 --> 04:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
followed in the past to examine whether
 
04:14:11.590 --> 04:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
or not there is a gleam of TR truth in
 
04:14:15.630 --> 04:14:15.640 align:start position:0%
this uh then allegations made of some of
 
04:14:18.590 --> 04:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh not for profits regardless of their
 
04:14:21.830 --> 04:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
origin spe uh taking advantage of
 
04:14:26.109 --> 04:14:26.119 align:start position:0%
current tax law for their own benefits
 
04:14:29.229 --> 04:14:29.239 align:start position:0%
as opposed to actually providing a
 
04:14:34.189 --> 04:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
benefit uh it's always good to take a
 
04:14:36.389 --> 04:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
look at something to see whether there
 
04:14:40.389 --> 04:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
is any uh fraud or waste or abuse as far
 
04:14:43.469 --> 04:14:43.479 align:start position:0%
as the the keeping the entity he's on
 
04:14:47.910 --> 04:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
edge uh even if we pass it in January or
 
04:14:51.630 --> 04:14:51.640 align:start position:0%
pass it out uh in January and it goes on
 
04:14:53.309 --> 04:14:53.319 align:start position:0%
to the floor ought to pass it still
 
04:14:55.590 --> 04:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take effect until the next year
 
04:14:58.149 --> 04:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
after uh and it still has to go to the
 
04:15:02.550 --> 04:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
Senate so you
 
04:15:04.990 --> 04:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
know this is there's there's time
 
04:15:08.229 --> 04:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
involved one way or another as as far as
 
04:15:11.149 --> 04:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned I think we ought to have
 
04:15:12.990 --> 04:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
uh retention so that we can listen
 
04:15:15.429 --> 04:15:15.439 align:start position:0%
listen to their concerns we
 
04:15:19.389 --> 04:15:19.399 align:start position:0%
can take a look at some of the
 
04:15:21.030 --> 04:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
allegations that were made by
 
04:15:24.990 --> 04:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
individuals in good faith and make it
 
04:15:28.229 --> 04:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
clear one way or another
 
04:15:30.990 --> 04:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
that uh this bill should pass or should
 
04:15:34.910 --> 04:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
not pass itl but the only way we can do
 
04:15:37.269 --> 04:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
that with the time we have is to get it
 
04:15:40.990 --> 04:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
out and by deadline this is an early
 
04:15:43.950 --> 04:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
bill so by March 6th has to be reported
 
04:15:47.229 --> 04:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
one of three ways this this way he gives
 
04:15:49.269 --> 04:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
it a chance to take a look at it and
 
04:15:52.990 --> 04:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
then report it out in uh a considered
 
04:15:58.189 --> 04:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
fashion as opposed to a rapid uh example
 
04:16:01.349 --> 04:16:01.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair yeah I mean I I think
 
04:16:02.550 --> 04:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons this is being
 
04:16:05.229 --> 04:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
retained is because in its current form
 
04:16:10.309 --> 04:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
there are some concerns um and the um
 
04:16:12.429 --> 04:16:12.439 align:start position:0%
and and when we look at the public
 
04:16:14.510 --> 04:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
hearing during the public hearing we had
 
04:16:16.830 --> 04:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
a vast number of people supporting the
 
04:16:19.790 --> 04:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
bill I think one person opposed it now
 
04:16:22.349 --> 04:16:22.359 align:start position:0%
since we have gone away from that public
 
04:16:23.750 --> 04:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
hearing finished that public hearing
 
04:16:26.710 --> 04:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
we've had a myriad of people against it
 
04:16:28.670 --> 04:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
um where were they at that time I don't
 
04:16:31.990 --> 04:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
know but that has caused us to say okay
 
04:16:34.550 --> 04:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
we had all this support now we have all
 
04:16:36.870 --> 04:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
this nons support let's take a look at
 
04:16:39.229 --> 04:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
it and retain it and and figure it out
 
04:16:40.710 --> 04:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
there there are some things that have
 
04:16:42.550 --> 04:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
been brought to light that are concerns
 
04:16:46.910 --> 04:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
so so um u in its current form it it
 
04:16:50.109 --> 04:16:50.119 align:start position:0%
most likely will have to change
 
04:16:52.710 --> 04:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
representative Opel and then
 
04:16:55.349 --> 04:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
Aly I'll defer to representative Aly to
 
04:16:57.030 --> 04:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
be okay
 
04:16:58.790 --> 04:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
yeah my
 
04:17:00.950 --> 04:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
recollection of that meeting and my
 
04:17:04.389 --> 04:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
notes on that meeting were that among
 
04:17:09.149 --> 04:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
the 20 people that spoke 19 of whom were
 
04:17:13.550 --> 04:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
for the bill on they did didn't know the
 
04:17:16.990 --> 04:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
difference between a legal migrant and
 
04:17:19.269 --> 04:17:19.279 align:start position:0%
an illegal
 
04:17:22.750 --> 04:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
alien they thought that refugees were
 
04:17:25.469 --> 04:17:25.479 align:start position:0%
illegal they were they they wanted
 
04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
refugees to be illegal they wanted
 
04:17:31.630 --> 04:17:31.640 align:start position:0%
people who were waiting for asy Asylum
 
04:17:36.269 --> 04:17:36.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:38.389 --> 04:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
illegal um I don't I don't think we
 
04:17:40.750 --> 04:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
should make judgments on the capacity of
 
04:17:43.429 --> 04:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
the people that testified um
 
04:17:46.269 --> 04:17:46.279 align:start position:0%
I think the at the the highest level we
 
04:17:47.870 --> 04:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
know that there were a lot of people for
 
04:17:49.590 --> 04:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
it and now we're getting a lot of
 
04:17:51.469 --> 04:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
negative and people are making some some
 
04:17:54.030 --> 04:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
points okay so let's that's that's the
 
04:17:56.109 --> 04:17:56.119 align:start position:0%
reason we we're retaining it in my mind
 
04:17:57.870 --> 04:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
anyone anyone
 
04:18:00.030 --> 04:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
else repres
 
04:18:05.030 --> 04:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
op um I guess I'm I'm missing the point
 
04:18:06.950 --> 04:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
here with all due respect to my
 
04:18:08.670 --> 04:18:08.680 align:start position:0%
colleague representative
 
04:18:11.429 --> 04:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
oler uh the intent of this bill and the
 
04:18:14.030 --> 04:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
and the vast majority of people who
 
04:18:17.309 --> 04:18:17.319 align:start position:0%
testified um at our hearing were focused
 
04:18:21.189 --> 04:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
on the issue of undocumented
 
04:18:21.199 --> 04:18:22.830 align:start position:0%
on the issue of undocumented
individuals

04:18:22.830 --> 04:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
04:18:26.670 --> 04:18:26.680 align:start position:0%
um more than at least as I heard it more
 
04:18:30.469 --> 04:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
than the issue of not for-profits it was
 
04:18:33.030 --> 04:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
the idea was that there were some not
 
04:18:35.269 --> 04:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
for-profits providing services to
 
04:18:35.279 --> 04:18:37.149 align:start position:0%
for-profits providing services to
undocumented

04:18:37.149 --> 04:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
undocumented
 
04:18:38.750 --> 04:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
individuals what I'm hearing
 
04:18:42.149 --> 04:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
representative ol say is that we should
 
04:18:46.590 --> 04:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
be looking at not um not for-profit
 
04:18:48.510 --> 04:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
organizations that are apparently taking
 
04:18:50.510 --> 04:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
advantage of the tax
 
04:18:53.469 --> 04:18:53.479 align:start position:0%
law um in
 
04:18:53.479 --> 04:18:55.030 align:start position:0%
law um in
a

04:18:55.030 --> 04:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:18:57.870 --> 04:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
um I hate to use the word fraudulent but
 
04:18:59.189 --> 04:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
that's what it sounded like he was
 
04:19:02.630 --> 04:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
referring to um that seems like a
 
04:19:04.950 --> 04:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
completely different issue to me and and
 
04:19:07.109 --> 04:19:07.119 align:start position:0%
if someone wants to introduce a bill to
 
04:19:09.910 --> 04:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
focus on that issue that's one thing but
 
04:19:13.670 --> 04:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
that has nothing to do that issue
 
04:19:15.590 --> 04:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
I don't really think came up during the
 
04:19:17.950 --> 04:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
hearing the focus was on undocumented
 
04:19:19.790 --> 04:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
individuals and
 
04:19:23.229 --> 04:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
services and occasionally a situation
 
04:19:28.790 --> 04:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
where um As I understood it um and an
 
04:19:30.309 --> 04:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
organization like Catholic Charities
 
04:19:32.790 --> 04:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
might provide one meal to an
 
04:19:36.149 --> 04:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
undocumented person and and in that case
 
04:19:36.159 --> 04:19:36.950 align:start position:0%
undocumented person and and in that case
could

04:19:36.950 --> 04:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:19:41.229 --> 04:19:41.239 align:start position:0%
be um you know could be denied the uh
 
04:19:44.149 --> 04:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
the 501c3 tax status or tax status in
 
04:19:48.070 --> 04:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um which is why I think
 
04:19:50.670 --> 04:19:50.680 align:start position:0%
the move to retain this we're we're
 
04:19:52.510 --> 04:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
going off in a completely different
 
04:19:55.030 --> 04:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
direction the people who who testified
 
04:19:57.590 --> 04:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
in support I don't think we testifying
 
04:20:00.269 --> 04:20:00.279 align:start position:0%
in support of the question of the tax
 
04:20:02.109 --> 04:20:02.119 align:start position:0%
status and whether organizations are
 
04:20:04.469 --> 04:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of it
 
04:20:08.109 --> 04:20:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:10.189 --> 04:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
chairman representative
 
04:20:12.910 --> 04:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
ORS thank you Mr chairman so one of the
 
04:20:14.990 --> 04:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
things we learned during the
 
04:20:18.750 --> 04:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
hearing was that these organizations
 
04:20:21.710 --> 04:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
can immediately check to see if these
 
04:20:24.030 --> 04:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
immigrants have legal or illegal status
 
04:20:27.510 --> 04:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
so the concern of who they're settling
 
04:20:28.910 --> 04:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
into our
 
04:20:30.990 --> 04:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
community as to whether or not we're
 
04:20:33.469 --> 04:20:33.479 align:start position:0%
putting undue pressure on them that that
 
04:20:35.750 --> 04:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
argument goes away as we heard the other
 
04:20:40.030 --> 04:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
side testify that they can uh basically
 
04:20:43.469 --> 04:20:43.479 align:start position:0%
uh what do they call them they can uh
 
04:20:46.189 --> 04:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
check on their I'm sorry I got a
 
04:20:49.309 --> 04:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
tickle uh they can immediately verify
 
04:20:53.030 --> 04:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
their immigration status so I don't see
 
04:20:55.630 --> 04:20:55.640 align:start position:0%
where the unnecessary or or or pressure
 
04:20:58.790 --> 04:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
or unprofessionalism would be for those
 
04:21:00.189 --> 04:21:00.199 align:start position:0%
that have presented this bill and
 
04:21:01.750 --> 04:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
brought it forward thank you
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative jet thank you Mr chairman
 
04:21:05.950 --> 04:21:05.960 align:start position:0%
for the exact reason we're hearing all
 
04:21:08.469 --> 04:21:08.479 align:start position:0%
this dialogue I understand why the
 
04:21:12.269 --> 04:21:12.279 align:start position:0%
motion to retain the bill is at hand so
 
04:21:13.710 --> 04:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
can we
 
04:21:17.269 --> 04:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:21.790 --> 04:21:21.800 align:start position:0%
please thank you representative uh
 
04:21:27.269 --> 04:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
Aly on one of the um nonprofits that
 
04:21:27.279 --> 04:21:28.269 align:start position:0%
Aly on one of the um nonprofits that
wrote

04:21:28.269 --> 04:21:28.279 align:start position:0%
wrote
 
04:21:33.910 --> 04:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
back explained if people read it that
 
04:21:37.630 --> 04:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
that system is made for whether someone
 
04:21:40.109 --> 04:21:40.119 align:start position:0%
was eligible to be
 
04:21:44.269 --> 04:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
hired that system was not made for
 
04:21:48.149 --> 04:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
someone is allowed to be in this
 
04:21:51.670 --> 04:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
country and I think that if you're going
 
04:21:53.670 --> 04:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
to retain it the first thing we have to
 
04:21:57.229 --> 04:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
do is get someone in to explain
 
04:22:01.510 --> 04:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
that because the people that
 
04:22:05.030 --> 04:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
are doing food banks and things like
 
04:22:05.040 --> 04:22:06.550 align:start position:0%
are doing food banks and things like
that

04:22:06.550 --> 04:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:22:10.189 --> 04:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
um if we lose all of those people doing
 
04:22:12.870 --> 04:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
food banks and those people providing
 
04:22:17.030 --> 04:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
shelter at night in the winter uh to
 
04:22:20.630 --> 04:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
people they are not capable of figuring
 
04:22:24.990 --> 04:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
out if somebody is El is eligible to be
 
04:22:28.590 --> 04:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
in the country they are capable only of
 
04:22:33.510 --> 04:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:36.750 --> 04:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
them representative
 
04:22:39.990 --> 04:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
YY I thank representative Aly for
 
04:22:42.269 --> 04:22:42.279 align:start position:0%
bringing out the points as to exactly or
 
04:22:45.189 --> 04:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
as one of the key reasons as to why we
 
04:22:47.750 --> 04:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
probably need to take a long look at
 
04:22:52.149 --> 04:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
this during the hearing issue issues
 
04:22:52.159 --> 04:22:53.070 align:start position:0%
this during the hearing issue issues
were

04:22:53.070 --> 04:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:22:56.550 --> 04:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
raised including the wording of the bill
 
04:22:58.790 --> 04:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
if anyone takes a look at my face during
 
04:23:01.710 --> 04:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
the uh testimony you'll understand there
 
04:23:04.189 --> 04:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
are Parts there that I have a but
 
04:23:06.910 --> 04:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
there are other parts that which we need
 
04:23:09.950 --> 04:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
to take a look at the way we do that is
 
04:23:11.429 --> 04:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
to retain
 
04:23:15.910 --> 04:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
as the ranking member knows uh we'll
 
04:23:19.149 --> 04:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
review it and then we'll make some
 
04:23:22.630 --> 04:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
either uh costic or uh affirming
 
04:23:25.469 --> 04:23:25.479 align:start position:0%
comments as it's recommended out of this
 
04:23:29.229 --> 04:23:29.239 align:start position:0%

HB 530 relative to increasing the amount
 
04:27:02.510 --> 04:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
of Revenue transferred from the real
 
04:27:05.550 --> 04:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
estate tax uh to the affordable housing
 
04:27:08.910 --> 04:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
fund currently $5 million oh wait wait
 
04:27:10.870 --> 04:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
wait I have to get a second first oh
 
04:27:15.830 --> 04:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:20.269 --> 04:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:22.149 --> 04:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
it would you like to speak to your
 
04:27:25.269 --> 04:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you Mr chairman um
 
04:27:27.750 --> 04:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
currently $5 million is transferred for
 
04:27:29.950 --> 04:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
this purpose and this bill seeks to
 
04:27:32.070 --> 04:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
raise the amount to $10 million which
 
04:27:34.950 --> 04:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
would result in a reduction of
 
04:27:39.870 --> 04:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
3,350 ,000 from the general fund and
 
04:27:43.950 --> 04:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
$1,650,000 from the educ trust fund I
 
04:27:45.590 --> 04:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
recently attended a new New Hampshire
 
04:27:47.429 --> 04:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
homebuilders association meeting in
 
04:27:49.469 --> 04:27:49.479 align:start position:0%
which the president revealed that the
 
04:27:52.269 --> 04:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
main issue they face is not money but
 
04:27:54.389 --> 04:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
rather the delay they experience due to
 
04:27:56.910 --> 04:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
excessive federal and state regulations
 
04:27:59.870 --> 04:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
which he claimed adds 25% to the cost of
 
04:28:02.510 --> 04:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
the average single family home the real
 
04:28:04.550 --> 04:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
estate trans uh the real estate transfer
 
04:28:07.149 --> 04:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
tax currently funds the general fund and
 
04:28:08.870 --> 04:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
the educational trust fund as I just
 
04:28:11.070 --> 04:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned we're currently experiencing
 
04:28:13.229 --> 04:28:13.239 align:start position:0%
pressure on both funds funds and that
 
04:28:15.149 --> 04:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
there's more demand you know for these
 
04:28:18.070 --> 04:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
funds uh than we can can meet so I do
 
04:28:19.790 --> 04:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
not recommend we take money away from
 
04:28:21.830 --> 04:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
either the general fund or the education
 
04:28:23.550 --> 04:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
trust fund for the purpose of
 
04:28:25.790 --> 04:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
subsidizing developers of affordable
 
04:28:27.990 --> 04:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
housing it is my opinion that further
 
04:28:29.830 --> 04:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
government subsidies might lead to
 
04:28:32.030 --> 04:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
further inflation of construction and
 
04:28:33.870 --> 04:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
loss of other government services that
 
04:28:35.870 --> 04:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
currently the education trust fund and
 
04:28:38.429 --> 04:28:38.439 align:start position:0%
general fund are providing thank you
 
04:28:42.469 --> 04:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
thank you other comments
 
04:28:45.550 --> 04:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:49.550 --> 04:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
opal um thank you Mr chairman I I've
 
04:28:53.830 --> 04:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
heard an awful lot about regulation
 
04:28:57.149 --> 04:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
being the the chief factor
 
04:29:00.510 --> 04:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
in uh the housing the current housing
 
04:29:03.349 --> 04:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
crisis um but we have a housing crisis
 
04:29:06.349 --> 04:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
in my district in Kanan Dorchester and
 
04:29:09.950 --> 04:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
orange um Kanan the largest of those
 
04:29:12.550 --> 04:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
communities my hometown
 
04:29:15.429 --> 04:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
does not have comprehensive
 
04:29:20.149 --> 04:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
zoning um the only requirements we have
 
04:29:23.389 --> 04:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
are the State Building Code which is
 
04:29:26.550 --> 04:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
essentially uh a fire and safety code at
 
04:29:28.830 --> 04:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
its most
 
04:29:32.590 --> 04:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
Elemental um things like requiring smoke
 
04:29:36.870 --> 04:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
detectors to help keep people alive um I
 
04:29:40.229 --> 04:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
don't think and I I I don't disagree
 
04:29:43.309 --> 04:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
that there are issues with regulation
 
04:29:46.670 --> 04:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh there are delays in in other places
 
04:29:50.990 --> 04:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure that it is the only or
 
04:29:55.189 --> 04:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
the even the chief issue I do think the
 
04:29:57.030 --> 04:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
availability of additional funds to the
 
04:29:59.309 --> 04:29:59.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing
 
04:30:02.590 --> 04:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
Organization um a lot of the housing
 
04:30:05.550 --> 04:30:05.560 align:start position:0%
that's going up to any degree is not
 
04:30:07.469 --> 04:30:07.479 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing is not housing for

04:30:36.469 --> 04:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
case um people need a place to live
 
04:30:40.469 --> 04:30:40.479 align:start position:0%
