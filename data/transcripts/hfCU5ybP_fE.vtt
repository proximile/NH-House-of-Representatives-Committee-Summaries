audit
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
we've drafted over 20 observations and
 
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
we expect to provide a draft report to
 
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
weeks regarding the state oversight of
 
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
special education the audit is currently
 
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
staffed with four performance
 
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
Auditors we estimate that we're
 
00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 align:start position:0%
approximately half
 
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
audit uh this is a very large audit
 
00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
scope with numerous federal and state
 
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
laws uh expecting a lengthy Report with
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
40 plus
 
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
observations we don't anticipate having
 
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
a completed draft report until the end
 
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
year moving on to the Secretary of
 
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
State's archives and Records uh this
 
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
committee approved the audit of the
 
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 align:start position:0%
archives at its last meeting in August
 
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee approved the topic
 
00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
at their September meeting
 
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
we reached out to the Secretary of
 
00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.759 align:start position:0%
State's office in preparation for the
 
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
upcoming audit and uh it was secretary
 
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
scanland position that the archives may
 
00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
not be subject to a performance
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
audit uh he has asked the Attorney
 
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
General's office to review whether or
 
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
not a performance audit can be
 
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
performed and we have not received any
 
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
further information on this so we are
 
00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
unable to move forward with the audit
 
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
until we have a resol solution to this
 
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
matter and uh I believe there are
 
00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:04.759 align:start position:0%
representatives from the Attorney
 
00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 align:start position:0%
General's office here and I believe
 
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
secretary scanlin is there in the back
 
00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
as well if you would like to hear from
 
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
from either of them well I think we'd
 
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
probably like to hear from both of them
 
00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 align:start position:0%
okay so let's start with the Secretary
 
00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.029 align:start position:0%
okay so let's start with the Secretary
of

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:22.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:26.710 align:start position:0%
 
State

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
yes do you okay what
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
just remind me okay good morning Mr
 
00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
provision Dave can you turn your mic on
 
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I there is a statutory
 
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
provision uh that exists in rsa1 14
 
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.950 align:start position:0%
provision uh that exists in rsa1 14
colon

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
colon
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
31a and it
 
00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
here I always have trouble finding on a
 
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
quick glance that's what computer far
 
00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
any anyway just to paraphrase it it says
 
00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:24.199 align:start position:0%
that that the Constitutional officer in
 
00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:25.879 align:start position:0%
the conduct of your constitutional
 
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are exempt from uh the
 
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:30.280 align:start position:0%
requirement of having
 
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:32.120 align:start position:0%
a performance
 
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
audit and then if you look in the
 
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution I believe it's article
 
00:07:39.869 --> 00:07:39.879 align:start position:0%
67 part
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
two uh it clearly lists the Secretary of
 
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
State and the treasures constitutional
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
officers and then the next article
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
68 uh says that the records of the state
 
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
shall be kept in the office of the
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
secretary so clearly that's a
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional respons
 
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.550 align:start position:0%
constitutional respons
ibility

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
ibility
 
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
and if there's a question about the
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State uh being a
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
constitutional officer and keeping the
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
records of the state as a constitutional
 
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
Duty uh I don't know how it gets any
 
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
more basic than that uh um in terms of
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
being a constitutional officer and
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
having that
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility so I I'd like to start my
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
additional comments just by saying that
 
00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
I want to talk about the office first
 
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:32.360 align:start position:0%
not about me
 
00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:34.599 align:start position:0%
specifically but I am not aware that
 
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
there has ever been a performance audit
 
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
of the Secretary of State's office
 
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
because when the legislature in joint
 
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
convention elects the Secretary of State
 
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
they assume individually and solely the
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility that is provided in the
 
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution and an oath is is sworn to
 
00:08:58.509 --> 00:08:58.519 align:start position:0%
protect that uh you know that
 
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility and to do it to the best
 
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
of their ability I may only be here two
 
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
years somebody comes in and succeeds me
 
00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
then uh they assume that responsibility
 
00:09:14.069 --> 00:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
the management style may be different
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
from one person holding that office to
 
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
the next and I'm not going to be the one
 
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
that relinquishes that Authority and
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
seeds it to uh you the review of other
 
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
individuals that may or may not share
 
00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh requirements that I have and how that
 
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.509 align:start position:0%
 
done

00:09:40.509 --> 00:09:40.519 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
um so so that's number one and number
 
00:09:47.949 --> 00:09:47.959 align:start position:0%
two is from a personal perspective I
 
00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:49.399 align:start position:0%
take that role very
 
00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
seriously and and I am accountable uh to
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
the legislature because uh in joint
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
convention you placed me in this
 
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
position and I'm also accountable to the
 
00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:04.279 align:start position:0%
people of the State of New Hampshire and
 
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
I have uh you know taken on the duty to
 
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
meet that
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
responsibility in a fair and impartial
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
way the concern that I have is that if
 
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
you start
 
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
allowing uh review of
 
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
performance uh that can be come very
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
public uh
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
and and reflects the views of other
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
individuals that do not have that
 
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility for records and
 
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
archives there is nothing to prevent a
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
performance audit then of the election
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
process and I have a major concern with
 
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
that because politics can come into play
 
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
and uh you know depending on which part
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
is in power uh you know things could
 
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
take a sharp turn in a bad Direction and
 
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
there could be undue influence through
 
00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:58.959 align:start position:0%
this process placed on the individual
 
00:10:58.959 --> 00:10:59.750 align:start position:0%
this process placed on the individual
that

00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
is responsible for uh making sure that
 
00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:06.279 align:start position:0%
the elections in this state are fair and
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
impartial and I think that's one of the
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
reasons why this provision in the
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution and in the statute
 
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:17.720 align:start position:0%
exists the records and elections in my
 
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
opinion have the same weight of
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility in this process if you
 
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
allow a performance audit for one then
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
you're opening it up to the other and I
 
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
think that is very
 
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.790 align:start position:0%
think that is very
appropriate

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
um I had the benefit of coming in to the
 
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
position of having served under
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
secretary Garder for 20 years and so
 
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
when I assumed the role I knew where the
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
areas were in the office that needed to
 
00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:49.790 align:start position:0%
areas were in the office that needed to
be

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
addressed and we've been very aggressive
 
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh addressing uh the issues that I have
 
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
seen uh not only in archives but AC
 
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
across the board and all of the
 
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
divisions within our
 
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
department uh if you have had the
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity to visit the archives
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
recently uh I would hope that you would
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
notice that the Clutter and the and the
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
appearance of disorganization is gone uh
 
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
that everything is in its place uh we
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
have hired a new uh uh archist State
 
00:12:25.949 --> 00:12:25.959 align:start position:0%
archist who is Young professional and
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
highly trained in the issues related to
 
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
AR iives and through that we are uh
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
creating a new uh um inventory database
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh that's being
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
upgraded uh and uh you the records
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
classification being improved and uh
 
00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
security measures are being taken both
 
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh keeping track of who's
 
00:12:56.189 --> 00:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
entering the building and leaving uh
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
um uh to making sure that important
 
00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:01.959 align:start position:0%
documents are being preserved properly
 
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
and I would assume that when I'm no
 
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
longer doing this job that the person
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
that comes in after me is going to take
 
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
an assessment of uh you know the status
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
of things and then put their own stamp
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
on what's important and move forward uh
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
I have no problem being transparent so
 
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
there's any member of this committee me
 
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
any member of the legislature and even
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
the general public that wants to come
 
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
out see how things are being run and
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
handled we're more than happy to uh
 
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
exercise uh that right but at this point
 
00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
I think it is important that you allow
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional officer that has the
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility to exercise it without uh
 
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh undo outside influences that may or
 
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
may not be helpful I'd be happy to
 
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
answer any questions questions R
 
00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
peber thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I think
 
00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
your points are are very well taken all
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
of them I guess my question is and you
 
00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:06.519 align:start position:0%
started to answer it at the end there if
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
the legislature has the responsibility
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.160 align:start position:0%
oversight but we are not allowed to use
 
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
the tool that we use
 
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:19.720 align:start position:0%
for many other uses and I I your point
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
about the elections is very well taken I
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
guess my question is how do
 
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.310 align:start position:0%
guess my question is how do
we

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:31.720 align:start position:0%
um exercise that Duty in a most
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
professional way given the um volunteer
 
00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
legis volunteer nature of our
 
00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:42.759 align:start position:0%
legislature so the Constitution does not
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
give the oversight to the legislature it
 
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
gives that responsibility to the
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
Secretary of
 
00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
State there are laws that are passed to
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
develop the procedures that we can
 
00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
follow uh at The Archives and we bring
 
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
those for forward when we see needs
 
00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.790 align:start position:0%
those for forward when we see needs
there

00:14:59.790 --> 00:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:02.519 align:start position:0%
the the legislature controls the pur
 
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
strings uh they create the budget that
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
allows the Constitutional office to
 
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
operate and we are subject to financial
 
00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
audits uh I have no problem with that if
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
if if the legislature wants a financial
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
audit tomorrow or this afternoon uh then
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
I would say we're ready for you uh and I
 
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
will say that when I came on uh there
 
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%
was a recently included Financial audit
 
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh of the Secretary of State's office uh
 
00:15:37.949 --> 00:15:37.959 align:start position:0%
at least certain portions of it uh there
 
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
were some uh observations uh that needed
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
to be addressed and I can tell you that
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
I believe that we have addressed every
 
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
single one of those items that was
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
outstanding from that audit uh we have
 
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
brought in I I have brought in Personnel
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
to help with that um through my deputies
 
00:16:00.749 --> 00:16:00.759 align:start position:0%
I I brought in Aaron Hennessy uh and uh
 
00:16:02.749 --> 00:16:02.759 align:start position:0%
Patty Lovejoy I think most of you know
 
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
both of them they both have CPA
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
backgrounds and have been a tremendous
 
00:16:11.309 --> 00:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
help in organizing the recordkeeping and
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
and the and the financial practices uh
 
00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
in the department that were uh you know
 
00:16:19.949 --> 00:16:19.959 align:start position:0%
concerns and the observations in that
 
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:23.720 align:start position:0%
report so uh we made a point to follow
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
through on uh on that um again it's just
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
an example that you know we're taking
 
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
the role the Constitutional role uh very
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
very seriously Senator Lane thank you so
 
00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
I just want to kind of summarize we kind
 
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
of talked about a lot of stuff there so
 
00:16:42.749 --> 00:16:42.759 align:start position:0%
your the the the thrust of the argument
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
is that under the Constitution part 268
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
which defines the duties of the
 
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State it specifically says
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
the records of the state shall be kept
 
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
in the office of the secretary so that's
 
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
your duty constitutional Duty as a
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional officer and the the
 
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
second half of that is under uh
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
1431 which is um the audit division the
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
audit division shall and under Section D
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
there's one particular line in the
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
middle of a paragraph that probably
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
could easily be overlooked it says this
 
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
officer shall this paragraph shall not
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
apply to the Constitutional officers in
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
the execution of their constitutional
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
duties that's correct and that's the
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
line that I was looking for at the very
 
00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:26.839 align:start position:0%
beginning and that's in section D so the
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
argument is that it's obviously a
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
clearly defined duty of yours and the
 
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
audit division statute that we have
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
explicitly exempts constitutional
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
officers in the performance of their
 
00:17:40.029 --> 00:17:40.039 align:start position:0%
duties from performance audits yes okay
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you so I have a question though
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
and there are some duties and really I'm
 
00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
thinking of Vital Records which the
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
legislature gave to you in 1991 when it
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
transferred that division over from
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services so that's not
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
really a constitutional obligation it
 
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:07.799 align:start position:0%
was a
 
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
legislative requirement that the
 
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State took it over so the
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
Constitution didn't give you Vital
 
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
Records the legislature
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
did first of all vital records are
 
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
records of the state and and I will tell
 
00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
you a
 
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
story about when Bill Gardner was
 
00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State the records of the
 
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
state were not kept in his office they
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
were kept in a one of the divisions of
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
administrative services and there was
 
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
some issue about the records and how
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
they were being managed and uh and it
 
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
ended up as a court case and David suder
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
was the
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
judge uh and as the as the case was
 
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
being resolved Justice sudor said to
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
Bill Gardner you know the Constitution
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
says that you are responsible for those
 
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
records it doesn't matter that you don't
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
have physical control of them ultimately
 
00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
you are the one that is responsible for
 
00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
them and it was after that point then
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
that the archives was created uh under
 
00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office uh and
 
00:19:21.149 --> 00:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
the records of the state are now uh kept
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
there so with if we had not moved vital
 
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
records from Health and Human Service
 
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
if it was still there and the legis and
 
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
this committee wanted to do a
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
performance audit of Vital Records
 
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
contained in Health and Human Services
 
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
would you have the same
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
objection that we could not do a
 
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
performance audit of them because they
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
were records of the state even though
 
00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
you didn't have the budget you didn't
 
00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.350 align:start position:0%
you didn't have the budget you didn't
have

00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
the legislative authority to management
 
00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
you didn't have any
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
control over those records before they
 
00:20:13.149 --> 00:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
were brought in would we hear the
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
same I think you might you might hear
 
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
the same argument so you might ask then
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
you know well is there any division in
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office that is
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
subject to uh a performance audit and
 
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
you know clearly I think Securities
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
regulation would be a an example of one
 
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
of our divisions that might be subject
 
00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
to a performance audit uh you know
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
corporations keeps State records
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
relative to all the business entities
 
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
that operate in New Hampshire Vital
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
Records is you know our role in that is
 
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
keeping the vital statistic records of
 
00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
the citizens of the State of New
 
00:20:59.310 --> 00:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then uh we keep those
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
records now the information from those
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
records is shared with uh Health and
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
Human Services uh through an agreement
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
and through a legislative directive and
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
those procedures are probably subject to
 
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
uh a performance audit but the actual
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
keeping of the records uh uh is probably
 
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
a constitutional responsibility
 
00:21:26.669 --> 00:21:26.679 align:start position:0%
so I probably wasn't clear prior to 19
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry 2001
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
Records would there have been a problem
 
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
with us doing a performance audit of
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
Vital Records when it was still over at
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
Health and Human
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
Services or was it the
 
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
moving of
 
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
that body of Records to your
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
office that's a good question and I I I
 
00:21:58.909 --> 00:21:58.919 align:start position:0%
just don't know the answer to that yeah
 
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang so again as I'm listening
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
to that discussion the followup I would
 
00:22:04.269 --> 00:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
have is again I think the Justice suit's
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
point there are State records that were
 
00:22:08.669 --> 00:22:08.679 align:start position:0%
distributed amongst other agencies that
 
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
ultimately Justice sudor said are still
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
your responsibility and still your
 
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
obligation so the question that the
 
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
legislature in 2000 whatever it was
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
realized that these are State records
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
that were not not under the control of
 
00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:21.039 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State and mve them
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
under the control of the Secretary of
 
00:22:24.029 --> 00:22:24.039 align:start position:0%
State I think it's probably the point
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
but I wasn't around back then when that
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
happened but I think that was probably
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
again to Justice suit point there are a
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
lot of Records within the state that
 
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have to make sure we get
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
control of that um so I don't know if
 
00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
that's an answer other than to say I
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
would if it's argued that it is a state
 
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
record then it is his responsibility
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
therefore would not be subject to if
 
00:22:44.909 --> 00:22:44.919 align:start position:0%
it's if you qualify it as a state record
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
if if I can just add this to for the
 
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
benefit of the committee is that the
 
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
agencies are constantly creating records
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
and and and in the process of doing that
 
00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:57.320 align:start position:0%
they're they're following the statutes
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
that apply to them and I think in that
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
process um certainly is auditable and
 
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
then there is a period of time when the
 
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
agency records are no longer needed kind
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
of on a day-to-day basis but they need
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
to be kept for a period of time at that
 
00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:18.039 align:start position:0%
point they get transferred to the
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
archives and then the archives holds
 
00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:21.630 align:start position:0%
archives and then the archives holds
those

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:21.640 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
records uh and gives them back to the
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
agencies as needed if a court case comes
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
up and they need to reference those
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
materials or
 
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
whatever and then there is a point uh
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
that is established by the agency of
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
when those records can be destroyed and
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
the archives does take care of that
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
process once the agency signs off on
 
00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:46.039 align:start position:0%
them and says so there there is a
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
transition of what happens with records
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
uh when other agencies are performing
 
00:23:51.919 --> 00:23:52.870 align:start position:0%
uh when other agencies are performing
their

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and then those records
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
get transferred to the
 
00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
archives uh for
 
00:24:02.269 --> 00:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
proper keeping and many of the records
 
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
are permanent U that's why we have to
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
keep adding additions onto the back of
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
the building to store all of those
 
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
records but
 
00:24:16.269 --> 00:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
Webber I think my question's been taken
 
00:24:21.789 --> 00:24:21.799 align:start position:0%
care of thank you madam chair thank
 
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
W I move that we remove this from the
 
00:24:33.149 --> 00:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
suggestions any further discussion
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
Senator with me I think before we take
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
that vote we were going to hear from the
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
attorney general hear from the AG's
 
00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:43.720 align:start position:0%
office if you
 
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
would withdraw motion I'll withdraw the
 
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.750 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
morning morning thank you for the record
 
00:24:59.710 --> 00:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
Chris Bond associate attorney
 
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
general uh so yeah our office was asked
 
00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:04.039 align:start position:0%
by the Secretary of State's office to
 
00:25:06.669 --> 00:25:06.679 align:start position:0%
take a look at this
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
um we certainly appreciate the uh the
 
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:11.320 align:start position:0%
important oversight function that the
 
00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:14.039 align:start position:0%
LBA provides but we also it's important
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
for us to make sure that we give meaning
 
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
to every statutory enactment and really
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
what we grappled with was RSA
 
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
1431 excuse me
 
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
1431a Roman 1 upset D that uh Senator
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
Lang just quoted from um that this
 
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
paragraph shall not apply to
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
constitutional officers in the execution
 
00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
of their constitutional
 
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
duties um and as also noted by secretary
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
scanland the the Constitution does
 
00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:45.919 align:start position:0%
provide that keeping of Records is a
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional function that the that
 
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:51.640 align:start position:0%
the secretary does so um I I appreciate
 
00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
the discussion that you just had and
 
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald you're hypothetical
 
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
about if the documents had been left uh
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
with vital records for example had been
 
00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
left I um I'm also not prepared to
 
00:26:03.789 --> 00:26:03.799 align:start position:0%
answer that but just in thinking about
 
00:26:08.669 --> 00:26:08.679 align:start position:0%
it um seems to me if this uh body the
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
legislature gives uh duties via statute
 
00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:16.039 align:start position:0%
to an agency to do something with
 
00:26:17.549 --> 00:26:17.559 align:start position:0%
records that they could audit that
 
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
function so if they've if they've asked
 
00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:21.799 align:start position:0%
an agency to to do something in that
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
case DHHS then they could do the
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
performance AIT of that and I think as
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
secretary scanland was mentioning there
 
00:26:30.389 --> 00:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
they can give statutory obligations to
 
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office as
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
insecurities um and those would be
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
auditable functions too so I think there
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
could have been a performance AIT of
 
00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
some aspects of the DHHS
 
00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping um but when the Secretary
 
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
of State uh
 
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
who as the the secretary notes always
 
00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:52.039 align:start position:0%
has a role with the records uh that role
 
00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:54.039 align:start position:0%
whether whether that records are
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
primarily housed at DHHS or at the
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office uh cannot by
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
operation of 1431a be audited um I do
 
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
think and also another problem we
 
00:27:05.909 --> 00:27:05.919 align:start position:0%
identified in looking this through is
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
that the audit terms are pretty broad
 
00:27:09.389 --> 00:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
just to say
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
archives um there could be uh particular
 
00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:16.919 align:start position:0%
statutory obligations embedded within
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
but the overall breadth is such that we
 
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
think it would put the Auditors in a
 
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
very awkward position to be trying to
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
discern on the fly in the midst of an
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
audit what constitutes a constitutional
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
function of recordkeeping and what
 
00:27:30.789 --> 00:27:30.799 align:start position:0%
constitutes a statutory so um in
 
00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:35.559 align:start position:0%
weighing all that we came down um uh in
 
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
our analysis on the side that 1431a
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
prevents the uh performance audit of the
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping function of the Secretary
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
of State I just ask you one other
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
question certainly when we do our
 
00:27:52.509 --> 00:27:52.519 align:start position:0%
budgeting um unlike with the judicial
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
branch we do kind of line item budgeting
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
of Secretary of State's office
 
00:28:01.039 --> 00:28:03.430 align:start position:0%
of Secretary of State's office
interesting

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
um yeah so it's funny you mention that
 
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
so one of the cases that there's not a
 
00:28:09.789 --> 00:28:09.799 align:start position:0%
lot of case law as you know and I I did
 
00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
take the opportunity to look at a a
 
00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
prior meeting of this group where you
 
00:28:16.029 --> 00:28:16.039 align:start position:0%
had talked about the the Senate research
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
that had been done and there's not a
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
statutory definition of some of these
 
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
terms but uh in looking for uh case law
 
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:25.240 align:start position:0%
um that there was a Supreme Court case
 
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
uh Daniels versus Hansen um and they
 
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
were looking at the
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
Constitutional function of Sheriff's
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
offices and um in that case the uh the
 
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners set a budget and in
 
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
the budget they eliminated two deputy
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
sheriff's positions and the Supreme
 
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.200 align:start position:0%
Court basically said you can set the
 
00:28:46.269 --> 00:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
budget County Commissioners but you
 
00:28:47.789 --> 00:28:47.799 align:start position:0%
can't decide how many sheriff's deputies
 
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:49.039 align:start position:0%
there are that's the sheriff's
 
00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation so they
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
couldn't they were held in that case not
 
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to have a line item budget
 
00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
because it encroached on the function
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
now they could shrink the budget if they
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to and maybe compel the result
 
00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:01.480 align:start position:0%
they were looking for but they couldn't
 
00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:03.039 align:start position:0%
specifically direct the sheriff to do
 
00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
that so I don't know if that's the
 
00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:06.200 align:start position:0%
closest analogous thing I could think of
 
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.149 align:start position:0%
closest analogous thing I could think of
but

00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
um uh uh that that's an interesting
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
conundrum Senor so again the question is
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
a financial audit would be completely
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
okay but a performance audit in the case
 
00:29:19.389 --> 00:29:19.399 align:start position:0%
of Records in this case would not we're
 
00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:21.519 align:start position:0%
budgeting money to an agency we can make
 
00:29:23.549 --> 00:29:23.559 align:start position:0%
sure that the money's being spent
 
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately whether it's a Secretary
 
00:29:26.509 --> 00:29:26.519 align:start position:0%
of State's office or not that's not a
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
function of recordkeeping for the state
 
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
it's a function of their of of a
 
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
financial audit so if we had a financial
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
audit we could do that but my
 
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919 align:start position:0%
understanding is
 
00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
1431a D is that speak that speaks to
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
Performance audits or or yeah so and
 
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
that's the limitation here that's
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
operative so yeah yeah thank you any
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:57.039 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%

[Music]

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
well I um so that's an interesting
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
question too and and I might want to
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
take a look at it further before I gave
 
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
a definitive answer but off the top of
 
00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
my head um the towns municipalities
 
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
they're all subsections of the state so
 
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
all their records are arguably State
 
00:30:28.269 --> 00:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
records so they all sort of like the the
 
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:30.200 align:start position:0%
secretary was leaning into the fact that
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
even if records are housed at another
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
agency there's still the responsibility
 
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
of the secretary I think that that would
 
00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:38.039 align:start position:0%
hold true for uh uh municipalities and
 
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
subsets of the state as well as for
 
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.549 align:start position:0%
subsets of the state as well as for
executive

00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
agencies further questions
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
representative you want to bring your
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
motion back thank you madam chair I move
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
that the subject of Secretary of State's
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
archives and Records be removed from the
 
00:30:57.279 --> 00:30:58.669 align:start position:0%
archives and Records be removed from the
performance

00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
performance
 
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
suggestions I I'll second that okay any
 
00:31:05.629 --> 00:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
further discussion if you're in favor of
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:16.509 --> 00:31:16.519 align:start position:0%
hand six and if you're
 
00:31:21.549 --> 00:31:21.559 align:start position:0%
opposed four the motion is adopted
 
00:31:26.909 --> 00:31:26.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:26.919 --> 00:31:31.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
yes um representative Earth had a
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
question about the special education
 
00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.549 align:start position:0%
question about the special education
dispute

00:31:41.549 --> 00:31:41.559 align:start position:0%
dispute
 
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
resolution thank you madam chair
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
so I started on this
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
committee uh when Senator Reagan was
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
still the chair it been his final
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
meeting and he was I believe a driver at
 
00:31:59.950 --> 00:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
least a strong proponent of the whole
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
special education um
 
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:05.519 align:start position:0%
audit and at that meeting in my
 
00:32:09.149 --> 00:32:09.159 align:start position:0%
recollection he was very clear that the
 
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
issues that he was trying to address
 
00:32:14.909 --> 00:32:14.919 align:start position:0%
were from his perspective primarily at
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
the the district level uh as opposed to
 
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Education uh
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
level and in going through the audit we
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
just released on Friday um I believe
 
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
there were over
 
00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.310 align:start position:0%
there were over

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
complaints from parents that were
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
referenced in that audit that had been
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
brought to the state
 
00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
level and my understanding about the
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
difficulty of that is that it's pretty
 
00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
difficult you got to be a pretty
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
persistent parent to push all the way
 
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
through to getting your complaint heard
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
at the state level which leads me to
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
believe that there may be many more um
 
00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:01.720 align:start position:0%
complaints that at at the district level
 
00:33:05.549 --> 00:33:05.559 align:start position:0%
that are not being uh appropriately um
 
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh dealt
 
00:33:09.789 --> 00:33:09.799 align:start position:0%
with I'm also led to believe that there
 
00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:13.720 align:start position:0%
are concerns about Federal funding or
 
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
the loss of federal funding if districts
 
00:33:16.919 --> 00:33:17.710 align:start position:0%
the loss of federal funding if districts
are

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:17.720 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
not appropriately
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
addressing these kinds of
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
complaints and after the last our last
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
meeting not the August meetings I not
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
president of that one but the one prior
 
00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
to that when I I'm pretty sure that's
 
00:33:35.389 --> 00:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
the meeting at which the scope statement
 
00:33:35.399 --> 00:33:36.190 align:start position:0%
the meeting at which the scope statement
or

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
statements were authorized for locked
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
with better a word um and this
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
discussion came up at that point and
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
during the meeting my recollection is
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
that well we'll start with what we have
 
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
what you're doing so subsequent to that
 
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
I spoke with uh Steve Smith who I not if
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not mistaken that's the your your
 
00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.389 align:start position:0%
I'm not mistaken that's the your your
predecessor

00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
predecessor
 
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
and I expressed my concern about the
 
00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
fact that we weren't looking weren't
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
considering looking through to the uh
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
District level and he indicated that if
 
00:34:13.069 --> 00:34:13.079 align:start position:0%
it appeared that was necessary that we'd
 
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
come back and and look at it and I
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
realize obviously we've had a change
 
00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
Administration um in the LBA but it
 
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:20.919 align:start position:0%
would seem that your audit that was just
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
released on
 
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
Friday uh demonstrates that in fact
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
there is an issue um at the the district
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
level a pretty serious issue at the
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
district level that uh that we should
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
the auditing group should be addressing
 
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
to determine if we also have problems um
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
at that level and I would uh want to
 
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to I understand
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
the one audit is completed and I'm not
 
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
to be honest I'm not exactly clear the
 
00:34:51.069 --> 00:34:51.079 align:start position:0%
distinction between the two but given
 
00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
that one is still ongoing it would seem
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
that it would be appropriate to um
 
00:34:59.349 --> 00:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
expand that scope to include uh looking
 
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
through to the district
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
respond hello my name is Jay Henry I'm
 
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
the um performance audit supervisor for
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
the LBA the current special ed audit
 
00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
that's ongoing is looking at the rest of
 
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
the Department of education's special ed
 
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
Bureau and all their work so the audit
 
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
that we just finished was just at the
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
very end of special education it's when
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
there was a conflict between a parent in
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
the in the school over IEP or something
 
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
like that uh this other audit is
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
everything else and we're about halfway
 
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
through that audit it's likely to be
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
over 40 observations it's going to be
 
00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
one of those thick audits um and we
 
00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
still probably have another almost a
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
year to finished up that audit so to add
 
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
on another giant layer of the locals
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
would probably not this wouldn't be the
 
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
the audit to add it on to or we'll never
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
finish this topic uh the other thing I
 
00:36:17.309 --> 00:36:17.319 align:start position:0%
think I'll I'll mention is that this
 
00:36:20.829 --> 00:36:20.839 align:start position:0%
oversight of the district's offices or
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
district schools school districts um I
 
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
think we
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
see that the part department has much
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
more of a role in that than they've been
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
using over the years and I think you're
 
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
going to find that in this next audit
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
that um there could have been more
 
00:36:44.109 --> 00:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
oversight by the state over the whole
 
00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
process and I think you see that a
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
little bit also in the the audit that we
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
just finished so that that may address
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that you have plus
 
00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
going to the school districts that gets
 
00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.230 align:start position:0%
going to the school districts that gets
into

00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
going outside of the state a agency and
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
we have a limitation on how many
 
00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:06.200 align:start position:0%
non-state entities that we can audit
 
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
over a fiveyear term it's like I think
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
five over five years so we're we're
 
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
we're very limited in what non-state
 
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
entities we can go down
 
00:37:22.589 --> 00:37:22.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
course do you agree that the audit
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
you've produced demonstrates that there
 
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
is an issue at the district
 
00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
level with the satisfaction of these uh
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
complaints from parents regarding a
 
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:42.790 align:start position:0%
complaints from parents regarding a
special

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
education I don't know if we I
 
00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
would well we have we said about 300
 
00:37:52.589 --> 00:37:52.599 align:start position:0%
complaints that over I think a two-year
 
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
period the audit period that's out of
 
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
30,000 kids who are have an IEP so you
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
know it's a small percentage of all kids
 
00:38:06.309 --> 00:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
what you know one concern is not
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
everyone maybe not every parent is
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of the dispute
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
resolution process and I think that's
 
00:38:16.349 --> 00:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's true
 
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:19.640 align:start position:0%
um but I think first I think the state
 
00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
needs to get its sort of house in order
 
00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
I mean if you go through our the audit
 
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
that you just saw a lot of it is
 
00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
informing parents and schools of what
 
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
should be happening and and that's like
 
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
a first step in trying to improve that
 
00:38:38.309 --> 00:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
process thank
 
00:38:38.319 --> 00:38:40.630 align:start position:0%
process thank
you

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
yes okay so if I understand what you're
 
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
saying it's incumbent upon the state to
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
try to reach out to all the parents
 
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
30,000 I guess you're referring
 
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:55.839 align:start position:0%
to to push on their
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
end to deal with the
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
districts their local districts rather
 
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
than there being any effort to push on
 
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:06.200 align:start position:0%
the districts to obey the law the
 
00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
federal law which could potentially lead
 
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
to loss of funding if not followed is
 
00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:12.440 align:start position:0%
that an accurate
 
00:39:14.589 --> 00:39:14.599 align:start position:0%
representation no I think it's both
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
parents and schools I think the schools
 
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
are also
 
00:39:21.069 --> 00:39:21.079 align:start position:0%
not you know they're looking at the
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
department they're looking at the
 
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
Department's website looking for
 
00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:25.079 align:start position:0%
information and you know that's where we
 
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
found some problems with it so it's it's
 
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
not just for the parents but it's for
 
00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
the whole all the
 
00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:33.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholders involved in special
 
00:39:36.309 --> 00:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
ed represent
 
00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and it it this has been
 
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
an interesting wals through um chapter
 
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.030 align:start position:0%
an interesting wals through um chapter
14

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
14
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
31- a but I think it is equally clear
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
from the language here that you're only
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
allowed the the authority of the uh
 
00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistant to conduct
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
post audits on non-state agencies shall
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
be limited to five entities in a 5-year
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
period and of course each individual
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
school district is its own entity so I
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
think that what I'm hearing in this
 
00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
discussion is that the first step is for
 
00:40:23.309 --> 00:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education to in
 
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
accordance with the recommendations
 
00:40:27.309 --> 00:40:27.319 align:start position:0%
already made and some that are being
 
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
being made to ensure that they are
 
00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
appropriately exercising the supervision
 
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
powers that they already already have
 
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
that have already been given to them in
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
terms of ensuring that the individual
 
00:40:43.309 --> 00:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
districts are doing their job and that's
 
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
the way to
 
00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
start addressing the problem and
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
obviously there's more work to be done
 
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.030 align:start position:0%
obviously there's more work to be done
after

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
that Senator Whitley thank you madam
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
chair um and just to build off what
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative what Weber was saying I
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
just want to bring back into the
 
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
conversation something that we raised
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
with you last meeting or the meeting
 
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
before about you know just because the
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
audit is sort of limited in scope to
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
just the department of Ed that does not
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
mean we won't be getting information
 
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
about the districts that you know
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps are not meeting their
 
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
requirements under federal law and but
 
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
that's assuming that the department of
 
00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:26.079 align:start position:0%
Ed is fulfilling its robust monitoring
 
00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:27.640 align:start position:0%
Authority that it does have under
 
00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:29.720 align:start position:0%
federal law this committee may remember
 
00:41:35.069 --> 00:41:35.079 align:start position:0%
that there there is very um uh detailed
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
requirements in federal special ed law
 
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
about what the doe is supposed to be
 
00:41:41.069 --> 00:41:41.079 align:start position:0%
doing at the district level in terms of
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
monitoring enforcement and so I just
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to confirm again that you know
 
00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:47.839 align:start position:0%
your work is also looking at what you
 
00:41:50.109 --> 00:41:50.119 align:start position:0%
know doe fulfilling its monitoring
 
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
Authority and if that is the case I mean
 
00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
it should sort of bring up those
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
districts is that
 
00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.069 align:start position:0%
districts is that
correct

00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
Senator I think Senator Whitley just hit
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
my point my point was I think in the
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
audit you just said that there's
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
Authority that the Department's not
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
using that it can use that would
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
probably resolve some of the local
 
00:42:10.829 --> 00:42:10.839 align:start position:0%
issues and I think it's now time that's
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
it's been identified that the department
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
can use that Authority maybe that'll
 
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
start resolving some of the issues so I
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
I think that's what you said if I'm not
 
00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
mistaken is that there's Authority the
 
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
Department's not using on local school
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
boards or local school districts that it
 
00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:25.640 align:start position:0%
could and you pointed it out hopefully
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
they'll take that to heart and start
 
00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
doing that which will resolve some of
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
the local issues I think we're going to
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
get a big audit A thick one at the end
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
of the year is what I heard Madam chair
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
yes might it be possible to see the D if
 
00:42:44.109 --> 00:42:44.119 align:start position:0%
the department has any response to what
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
we've been hearing here yes if there are
 
00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
no more questions of the LBA on this
 
00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
issue okay don't go away does the
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record Frank ad
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of education and I'm not
 
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
trying to have a groundhog day here
 
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
because we spent quite a bit of time
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
talking about the scope um at the time
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
we spoke about the scope I was quite
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
clear that I believe that uh the audit
 
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
as it was configured was not responsive
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
to the concerns that originally put this
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
audit on the table to begin with uh when
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
Senator Reagan was being responsive to
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh a number of issues that individual
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
families from the field brought to us uh
 
00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
we appreciate that the LBA believes we
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
have this superpower uh we have yet to
 
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
find a district that agrees with that or
 
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
a district attorney that agrees with
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
that so while they believe that we
 
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
somehow can just ask for this
 
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
information or demand this information
 
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
um you know here to for it has not been
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
forthcoming um I would also just like to
 
00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
point out there's incorrectness in terms
 
00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
of the limitation on the LBA if you read
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
their statute uh they are not limited in
 
00:44:03.549 --> 00:44:03.559 align:start position:0%
terms of five entities when it's
 
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
referenced to uh school districts
 
00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:08.079 align:start position:0%
because those are political subdivisions
 
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
right they are part of the state and so
 
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
that statute does not limit them in that
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
regard is our understanding of the
 
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
statute so just as they're explaining to
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
me how my statutes work I'm going to
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
explain to them I believe how their
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
statutes work and uh and again um you
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
know we think that the uh here's what
 
00:44:28.589 --> 00:44:28.599 align:start position:0%
happens is so there are ating all of the
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
information that comes to me right which
 
00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
is a very small subset of the issues
 
00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:35.720 align:start position:0%
relative to special education to happen
 
00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
in the field and we don't even know
 
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
about many of these issues because they
 
00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
never come to our attention we don't see
 
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
those issues coming
 
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
in if a school district um you know is
 
00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:51.800 align:start position:0%
not providing uh appropriate services
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
and persuades a parent that it's okay or
 
00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
to just be quiet or go away uh we're not
 
00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
going to know about that we don't get
 
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
the complaint like if we get these 300
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
complaints we deal with them with the
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
tools that we have but the concern that
 
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
was raised initially was all of the
 
00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
stuff that doesn't reach us because of
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh potentially poor oversight poor
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
implementation at the district level and
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
so I think that was the original inent
 
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
from Senator Reagan um I think that's
 
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
the original attent from the
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
constituents who had reached out um but
 
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
we understand that uh we've had this
 
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
hearing but so so those are my comments
 
00:45:30.549 --> 00:45:30.559 align:start position:0%
relative to the conversation here today
 
00:45:30.559 --> 00:45:31.270 align:start position:0%
relative to the conversation here today
thank

00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
you I one question yes Senator that so
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
just one
 
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
question actually one second um Melissa
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
white division director for learner
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
support I think just one key point I
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to add is that the state
 
00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.430 align:start position:0%
wanted to add is that the state
contributes

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
contributes
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
$225,000 for the administration of
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
special education to the department so
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
the only part that the state is
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
contributing to the operation this
 
00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
includes dispute resolution and all that
 
00:45:58.349 --> 00:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
of pieces of special education is
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
$225,000 so we are at times limited in
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
our Focus because we have to prioritize
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
the federal requirements because the
 
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
federal government is paying to meet
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
those requirements so I think it's just
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
key to delineate how much the state is
 
00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.790 align:start position:0%
key to delineate how much the state is
actually

00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
contributing my simple question was
 
00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
around reporting right so is is there a
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
is there a requirement of a school
 
00:46:22.549 --> 00:46:22.559 align:start position:0%
district report the number of complaints
 
00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:25.559 align:start position:0%
and at all to this to the uh departments
 
00:46:27.069 --> 00:46:27.079 align:start position:0%
like we've received a th000 and
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
complaints from parents on relative to
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
special education is there any kind of
 
00:46:33.069 --> 00:46:33.079 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement that we have so we
 
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
can gauge whether what three how 300
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
ratios to the total number of complaints
 
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
that were received thank you for the
 
00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
question we do not collect that number
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
what we do uh collect is that they have
 
00:46:46.109 --> 00:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
a special education dispute resolution
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
process that they can provide to us and
 
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
so we can look at that that must be
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
implemented but we do not go in and look
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.839 --> 00:46:57.990 align:start position:0%
 
complaints

00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
where was that
 
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
hand rep
 
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
no Senator Whit thank you madam chair
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you again for coming up um can
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
you describe how you so what I'm hearing
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
is that you you don't hear about the
 
00:47:16.549 --> 00:47:16.559 align:start position:0%
problems at the district level unless
 
00:47:18.589 --> 00:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
you got a complaint from a parent can
 
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:22.559 align:start position:0%
you describe to us about how you all um
 
00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:26.119 align:start position:0%
comply with the Ida regulations about
 
00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
establishing requirements for State
 
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:29.240 align:start position:0%
monitoring enforcement and annual
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
reporting how do you comply to those
 
00:47:32.589 --> 00:47:32.599 align:start position:0%
requirements if you're only hearing
 
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
complaints that they come to you yep so
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
we do do monitoring and I'm going to let
 
00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:38.559 align:start position:0%
Melissa um speak to that but I was
 
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
thinking I would share an example of you
 
00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
know so that you see how kind of actual
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
things sort of unfold in the field and
 
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
how it may or may not come to us so um
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
and this is a complaint that we received
 
00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
um but it was after quite a bit of
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
process had already taken place uh so
 
00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
there was a p a particular family uh the
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
mother had a uh kindergartener who had
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
gone through kindergarten at the end of
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
the school year she believed that there
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
was some issues with her young child uh
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
not necessarily sure how to articulate
 
00:48:11.309 --> 00:48:11.319 align:start position:0%
those but was concerned about them and
 
00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:13.960 align:start position:0%
asked the school to hold her child back
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
and in typical Fashions the school did
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
not hold the child back insisted that
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
the kid move along to first grade how
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
the parent again believing that there
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
were issues with her child that she
 
00:48:25.109 --> 00:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to to deal with uh pulled the kid
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
out of school and started home educating
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
the student
 
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
During the period of home education and
 
00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
again this is all hindsight we didn't
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
know none of this is happening right so
 
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
there's this conflict at the school
 
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
district I want my kid to stay back
 
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:37.640 align:start position:0%
school says no parents pulled out
 
00:48:39.069 --> 00:48:39.079 align:start position:0%
department has no knowledge of this
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
taking place while the kid is
 
00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
homeschooling mom continues to be
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
concerned about the development of the
 
00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
child um while she's homeschooling in
 
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
January of that year so initially pulled
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
out in like the late August September
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
time frame uh goes out on her own dime
 
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
and has some neurological evaluations
 
00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
performed relative to her child because
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
she's that concerned about the
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
development of her kid um she continues
 
00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
to homeschool she's not making progress
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
she's concerned about her child she
 
00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:09.640 align:start position:0%
reenroll her child into special
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
education or into the public school
 
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
system um and she asks for evaluations
 
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
uh she brings her neurological
 
00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:19.400 align:start position:0%
evaluations to The District in about the
 
00:49:22.789 --> 00:49:22.799 align:start position:0%
May time frame uh they convene a team to
 
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
look at this child and determine what's
 
00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
up and they say not eligible for special
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
education but we will do some
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
evaluations um the parent asked for a
 
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
specific evaluation say I need this type
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
of an evaluation because I think this is
 
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
the appropriate one the school says we
 
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
don't do those but we'll do these
 
00:49:40.349 --> 00:49:40.359 align:start position:0%
evaluations so the school did those
 
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
evaluations and came back and concluded
 
00:49:45.309 --> 00:49:45.319 align:start position:0%
in August that um the child was not
 
00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
eligible for special education based on
 
00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
those evaluations they did not perform
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
the evaluation that the parent had asked
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
for um child continues in school and in
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
the fall they we get around to
 
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
completing the evaluations for the child
 
00:49:59.950 --> 00:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
that the mother was seeking and by
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
January the child has an IEP and is
 
00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:03.640 align:start position:0%
getting the supports and services that
 
00:50:06.589 --> 00:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
they need and so my concern is um and
 
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
then the parent files a complaint with
 
00:50:10.589 --> 00:50:10.599 align:start position:0%
me probably I think I'm dealing with it
 
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
at this point in time so uh you know
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
months later at this point in time right
 
00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
like so I'm in March now and so my
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
concern is that until that parent filed
 
00:50:22.349 --> 00:50:22.359 align:start position:0%
a complaint with me that the special
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
education process had not been followed
 
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
I would have no knowledge of that
 
00:50:30.349 --> 00:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
process not necessarily being followed
 
00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
Even in our monitoring of the school
 
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
district we're not going in and looking
 
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
at every individual case we're looking
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
at the policies and procedures that the
 
00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:39.640 align:start position:0%
school district has in place and so if
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
that school district and and our job is
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
not to second guess the IEP team per se
 
00:50:47.789 --> 00:50:47.799 align:start position:0%
but here's an example of how is it that
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
we as a district and I don't I don't
 
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
have any authority to override the
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
district even in this complaint but how
 
00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
is it that you know a parent on four
 
00:50:58.589 --> 00:50:58.599 align:start position:0%
separate occasion raises red flags and
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
says something's not right can somebody
 
00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
help me and the system is not responsive
 
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
to it so those the concerns that I have
 
00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
and then specific to your question I'll
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
let U Melissa talk about um you know our
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
school monitoring process the special
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
education um Bureau oversees the
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
monitoring for U meeting all of the idea
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
requirements and so we do have a robust
 
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
team internally that is um conducting
 
00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:25.240 align:start position:0%
that monitoring there was a different
 
00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
system that was set in place in a dist a
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
different monitoring process we have
 
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
since um Becky fet the director of
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
special education and myself have um
 
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
come into our positions we've
 
00:51:39.789 --> 00:51:39.799 align:start position:0%
re-evaluated that system and we are
 
00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
working with the US Department of
 
00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:44.440 align:start position:0%
Education and specifically uh the office
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
of special education programs at the
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
federal level to um re-evaluate our
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
monitoring system and to implement a
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
more robust uh system in that work so
 
00:51:55.309 --> 00:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
just to give you a little bit of
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
background on that so essentially so uh
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
Santina used to run the special
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
education department she hadd been
 
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
running it for 15 years and she had a
 
00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
certain monitoring uh protocol that she
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
was following that had approved had been
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
approved by used um Santina left and
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
went to a district and we hired Becky
 
00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
fet who is now running the department
 
00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
she came in she says I think there's a
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
more effective way to do it and so what
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
she's referring to is the change over in
 
00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
like between 2018 and 2020 um of the
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
monitoring system follow up yes thank
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
you so commissioner you said that
 
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
monitoring as sort of limited you can't
 
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:29.480 align:start position:0%
look at individual files that it's
 
00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:31.960 align:start position:0%
limited to just policies but the
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
requirements under Ida is that your
 
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
monitoring actually has to focus on
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
improving educational results and
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
functional outcomes for all children
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
with disabilities so how do you comply
 
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
with that requirement so you mis yeah so
 
00:52:46.589 --> 00:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
you just misunderstood when I said I
 
00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
don't look at if you're only looking at
 
00:52:51.309 --> 00:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
policy so hold on how can you do that if
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
you're not actually looking at
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
individual cases because they're pretty
 
00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
rigorous requirements yeah so what I was
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
referring to when I made that statement
 
00:53:01.309 --> 00:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
was the example that I talked about so I
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
would like to lean in on that specific
 
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
example and ask the school to uh you
 
00:53:08.109 --> 00:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
know do something specific about it but
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
in fact we only are able to in that
 
00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
complaint process identify technical
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
non-compliance as opposed to the fact
 
00:53:16.349 --> 00:53:16.359 align:start position:0%
that we have a kid who's not getting the
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
SE supports and services that we need
 
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if you want to go into
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
the detail about the actual monitoring
 
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
because it includes files obviously so
 
00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at Improvement
 
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
results for special education students
 
00:53:29.549 --> 00:53:29.559 align:start position:0%
specifically we do look at um rely
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
pretty heavily on our assessment data
 
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
and so we'll go in and look at that
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
assessment data and then we have an A a
 
00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:39.160 align:start position:0%
process where for example if we notice a
 
00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
specific school is um having results
 
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
that are maybe below average or they're
 
00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
not making a lot of improvement with
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
their special education subpopulation we
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
will go in and work through targeted
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
support interventions to do and it's a
 
00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:55.559 align:start position:0%
specific TSI CSI process where schools
 
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
are identified we will go in we will
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
work with those schools we hire
 
00:54:00.829 --> 00:54:00.839 align:start position:0%
contractors to work with those schools
 
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
um one of the ones we use right now is
 
00:54:04.589 --> 00:54:04.599 align:start position:0%
westad they have a pretty robust system
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
that they will go in and work with that
 
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
team to specifically the leadership and
 
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
also that the teachers in that school to
 
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
look specifically at that subpopulation
 
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
and say okay what are you know the
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
trends that we're noticing what
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
interventions can we help you to
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
implement what changes need to be made
 
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
at that school level in order to support
 
00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
those students and that list is
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
available on our website we identify
 
00:54:29.309 --> 00:54:29.319 align:start position:0%
those schools on an annual basis so that
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
is one of the ways that we work in
 
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
particular with our special education
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
monitoring process what we have in place
 
00:54:38.109 --> 00:54:38.119 align:start position:0%
now is looking maybe more specifically
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
let's say for example we have a school
 
00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:43.880 align:start position:0%
district that has um over 1% of their
 
00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
population identified as needing um
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
having intensive uh cognitive needs
 
00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
usually the Federal Department of
 
00:54:56.069 --> 00:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
Education identifies no more than 1% of
 
00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:57.880 align:start position:0%
your special education population is
 
00:55:00.190 --> 00:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
identified so if we notice the school
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
district has more we will go in we will
 
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
work with them to ensure that they're
 
00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
properly identifying students maybe
 
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
there are students that don't
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily qualify and we work with
 
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
them um so that's an example of some
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
sort of targeted support that we will go
 
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
in and give on that specific issue but
 
00:55:17.309 --> 00:55:17.319 align:start position:0%
if we're looking at that student level
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
like one student in a district with an
 
00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
issue we may not know some specifics
 
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
around that unless we have a complaint
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
coming from a parent and then it might
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
be specific ific to that student so it
 
00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:30.200 align:start position:0%
it varies across the board but for the
 
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
most part we have um systems in place in
 
00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:35.720 align:start position:0%
different programs that look at the
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
special education needs and if I may
 
00:55:40.349 --> 00:55:40.359 align:start position:0%
just again uh you know I've already
 
00:55:42.029 --> 00:55:42.039 align:start position:0%
vetted my concerns about the way that
 
00:55:44.109 --> 00:55:44.119 align:start position:0%
this AED is scoped and I appreciate the
 
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
conversation so um can I ask you made a
 
00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:53.720 align:start position:0%
surprising point about the amount of
 
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
money the state budgets 200
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
25,000 to oversee special education
 
00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
which doesn't sound like a
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
lot has the department ever asked for an
 
00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
increase in that line yes so the
 
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
increases that we've sought in special
 
00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
education when I first got to the
 
00:56:16.109 --> 00:56:16.119 align:start position:0%
department we were funding special
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
education for the districts at about
 
00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
72% um we
 
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:23.480 align:start position:0%
sought and I think with the help of
 
00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:24.589 align:start position:0%
sought and I think with the help of
Representative

00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
Wier excuse me
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh were awarded additional funds up to
 
00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%
34 million so now we are fully funding
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
that at the district district level I'm
 
00:56:39.549 --> 00:56:39.559 align:start position:0%
sorry the man the Department's so we
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
have not I don't no we have not s in
 
00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
oversite we actually the the thing that
 
00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
we've advocated for is really to provide
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
additional supports to the field because
 
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
funding do you feel you have
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
the resource ources to
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
oversee those local issues that
 
00:57:05.309 --> 00:57:05.319 align:start position:0%
representative Earth is concerned about
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
so the it would be difficult to oversee
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
some of those state laws because a lot
 
00:57:11.549 --> 00:57:11.559 align:start position:0%
of these are state funded items and so
 
00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
we don't have the ability to oversee
 
00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:15.640 align:start position:0%
those with federal funds unless there's
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
an overlap between the state obligation
 
00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
and the federal obligation um again so
 
00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
our approach has been how do we provide
 
00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
more resources to provide services to
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
students is what we've been seeking
 
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
thanks rep
 
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
webner my turn for Groundhog Day
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
okay what I'm hearing in representative
 
00:57:38.109 --> 00:57:38.119 align:start position:0%
Rosen wald's question
 
00:57:43.230 --> 00:57:43.240 align:start position:0%
is that we have a very small amount of
 
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
specific State funding for specific
 
00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:48.710 align:start position:0%
specific State funding for specific
State

00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
State
 
00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:52.280 align:start position:0%
monitoring and oversight and what I was
 
00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
hearing her ask you and what I want to
 
00:57:56.829 --> 00:57:56.839 align:start position:0%
know the answer
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
to is do we need to be changing that
 
00:58:05.789 --> 00:58:05.799 align:start position:0%
amount so that there is a more robust
 
00:58:08.829 --> 00:58:08.839 align:start position:0%
ability in your department to do the
 
00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
monitoring that we have been talking
 
00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:13.960 align:start position:0%
about it's nothing to do with the
 
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
overall Federal funding it's just our
 
00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
state funding and state oversight
 
00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely and if we're looking at also
 
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:23.480 align:start position:0%
introducing new legislation that has new
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
requirements within special education
 
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
that are not mirrored in federal um law
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
then we have to allocate funding for for
 
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
us in order to do that the 225,000
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
includes complaint
 
00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:39.160 align:start position:0%
investigators so we're having to use
 
00:58:41.029 --> 00:58:41.039 align:start position:0%
that fund also to contract for those
 
00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
complaint investigators that are
 
00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
specific to the dispute resolution
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
process and I think what I heard was the
 
00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
department has not asked for more
 
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
resources the the additional funding
 
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
we've saw has only been through the
 
00:58:55.589 --> 00:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
field right represent Weber so there
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
might be a request in another budget
 
00:59:03.029 --> 00:59:03.039 align:start position:0%
cycle to make that function more robust
 
00:59:05.069 --> 00:59:05.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think um in
 
00:59:07.309 --> 00:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
looking at the dispute resolution audit
 
00:59:09.069 --> 00:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
in addition to the special education
 
00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
audit that will help us to then
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
prioritize what our needs could be I
 
00:59:15.309 --> 00:59:15.319 align:start position:0%
think we do want to take a look at so
 
00:59:17.109 --> 00:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
expect a prioritize need is what she
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
just said
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
excellent any further questions
 
00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
on this audit topic which is
 
00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:27.750 align:start position:0%
on this audit topic which is
halfway

00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
halfway
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
through thank you thank you don't go
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%

00:59:50.109 --> 00:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
sort of housekeeping thing um the the
 
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
audit that that you decided to stall the
 
00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's audit of of
 
00:59:57.549 --> 00:59:57.559 align:start position:0%
archives that that went through fiscal
 
01:00:01.069 --> 01:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
the last time that this body stopped an
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
audit uh they also sent a letter to
 
01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal informing them of that so I I
 
01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:07.960 align:start position:0%
just want to make you aware that we
 
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
should the chair should write a letter
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
to to give to fiscal informing them that
 
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
this audit has been discontinued do you
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
have a template I I will I will get one
 
01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.190 align:start position:0%
have a template I I will I will get one
for

01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:23.240 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you and FIS we just
 
01:00:28.589 --> 01:00:28.599 align:start position:0%
meant in fiscal so you got almost four

weeks thank
 
01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
you okay moving on to the education
 
01:00:39.549 --> 01:00:39.559 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts audit uh chapter 297
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
laws of
 
01:00:43.589 --> 01:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
2022 uh which was effective on October
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
1st of
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
23 and uh we did provide the members
 
01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
with a handout on that um that requires
 
01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
a performance audit of the education
 
01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
Freedom account
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
program uh the law requires us to submit
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
a uh scope statement to this committee
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
for review and approval uh we had an
 
01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:05.240 align:start position:0%
entrance conference with the Department
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
on January
 
01:01:10.109 --> 01:01:10.119 align:start position:0%
9th we currently have three Auditors
 
01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
assigned to that audit who've been busy
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
gathering information to plan for the
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
audit and uh to start work on developing
 
01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
that scope
 
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
statement during the information
 
01:01:23.069 --> 01:01:23.079 align:start position:0%
gathering process we ran into a
 
01:01:25.109 --> 01:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
challenge uh something that we call a
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
scope limitation in auditing uh that we
 
01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to inform the committee about as
 
01:01:32.589 --> 01:01:32.599 align:start position:0%
it does significantly affect our ability
 
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
to move forward with the audit as
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
directed in the law and uh I'll explain
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
now the department contracts with a
 
01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
third party uh the children's
 
01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund to administer the
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
program contract Provisions state that
 
01:01:51.269 --> 01:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
all data including reports files
 
01:01:53.789 --> 01:01:53.799 align:start position:0%
computer programs notes letters papers
 
01:01:57.390 --> 01:01:57.400 align:start position:0%
and documents Etc under the contract are
 
01:01:59.829 --> 01:01:59.839 align:start position:0%
the property of the state and are owned
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
by the department uh the scholarship
 
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
organizations required to provide that
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
information to the department as
 
01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
requested by the department in
 
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
accordance with the
 
01:02:13.269 --> 01:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
contract this includes any data that the
 
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization has developed
 
01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
acquired or obtained while administering
 
01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:19.750 align:start position:0%
acquired or obtained while administering
the

01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
program these Provisions appear to allow
 
01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:25.240 align:start position:0%
the department to request information
 
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
from The Scholar ship Organization for
 
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
the Department's own oversight
 
01:02:34.109 --> 01:02:34.119 align:start position:0%
activities and for purposes of the
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
audit it's the Department's position
 
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:39.160 align:start position:0%
that the chapter law only gives our
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
office the authority to audit the
 
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:45.160 align:start position:0%
Department's oversight of the program so
 
01:02:47.069 --> 01:02:47.079 align:start position:0%
according to the department the law does
 
01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
not give the LBA the authority to audit
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization because the
 
01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
law does not specifically mention the
 
01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.029 align:start position:0%
law does not specifically mention the
contractor

01:02:57.029 --> 01:02:57.039 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
01:02:59.430 --> 01:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
the department is willing to provide us
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
with all program documentation that it
 
01:03:04.829 --> 01:03:04.839 align:start position:0%
has in its possession but it will not
 
01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:07.480 align:start position:0%
assist with obtaining the data and
 
01:03:10.029 --> 01:03:10.039 align:start position:0%
documents needed for the audit from the
 
01:03:13.069 --> 01:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization as according to
 
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
the department this would violate the
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
separation of powers between the
 
01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
branches this creates a substantial
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
scope limitation on the audit
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
much of the items listed in the chapter
 
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
law in items a through G cannot be
 
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
audited without access to the state
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
records and documents in the possession
 
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
of the scholarship
 
01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
organization if the committee would like
 
01:03:44.829 --> 01:03:44.839 align:start position:0%
some further details on what items we
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
would not be able to audit um I have the
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
senior manager here that could go down
 
01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
the list and uh let you know which items
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
we would not be able to
 
01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
bmer so my brain just started to
 
01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
bounce thank you for taking my question
 
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
sir am I understanding that the
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
department has taken the
 
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
position that
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
because a function that was originally
 
01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
given to the department has been
 
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
contracted out as the department May of
 
01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:24.710 align:start position:0%
contracted out as the department May of
course

01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
course
 
01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.470 align:start position:0%
course
do

01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.549 align:start position:0%
do
that

01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
we now have no authority
 
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
to do the audit because of a separation
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
of powers argument that seems to me to
 
01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
be very attenuated and I realize you're
 
01:04:45.069 --> 01:04:45.079 align:start position:0%
probably not the person to ask and I
 
01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
certainly will ask that question of the
 
01:04:51.269 --> 01:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
department as well but it and the mind
 
01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:53.799 align:start position:0%
still sitting in the back I think right
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
this this audit is different from other
 
01:04:58.829 --> 01:04:58.839 align:start position:0%
performance audits because the authority
 
01:05:02.269 --> 01:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
to uh perform the audit is in a separate
 
01:05:05.309 --> 01:05:05.319 align:start position:0%
chapter law it doesn't follow the normal
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
process um that we would typically
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
follow in conducting a performance audit
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
where the committee would give us an
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
audit topic and then we would go ahead
 
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:17.240 align:start position:0%
and and perform that audit this
 
01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
particular audit was established under
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
that chapter law and I think the
 
01:05:23.309 --> 01:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
Department's position is that because
 
01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
the chapter law doesn't spec spe
 
01:05:28.829 --> 01:05:28.839 align:start position:0%
specifically mention that uh scholarship
 
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
organization that uh our office does not
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
have the authority to um audit the
 
01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.990 align:start position:0%
have the authority to um audit the
scholarship

01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
organization follow
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
on so would I be correct in thinking
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
that um under that argument that this
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
body would have the authority to um
 
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
expand the scope of what was put into
 
01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
statute to make it clear that the
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
organization would be um required to
 
01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:01.640 align:start position:0%
provide the information needed for an
 
01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:03.549 align:start position:0%
provide the information needed for an
appropriate

01:06:03.549 --> 01:06:03.559 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
audit I think it could require an
 
01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:09.559 align:start position:0%
amendment to the chapter law um in order
 
01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
for us to obtain those those records to
 
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
perform the audit and um review the
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
items in a through G listed in the
 
01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.470 align:start position:0%
items in a through G listed in the
chapter

01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
law one yes and then thank you very much
 
01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
going with me on the journey uh but one
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
of the things I was thinking to make
 
01:06:32.829 --> 01:06:32.839 align:start position:0%
things somewhat easier because we all
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
know how long the process takes to amend
 
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
uh a statute as opposed to having this
 
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
body make uh a decision um could this
 
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
body choose
 
01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:48.109 align:start position:0%
body choose
to

01:06:48.109 --> 01:06:48.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
um not NE not amend the statute but
 
01:06:51.559 --> 01:06:52.670 align:start position:0%
um not NE not amend the statute but
simply

01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
simply
 
01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.510 align:start position:0%
simply
require

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:02.109 --> 01:07:02.119 align:start position:0%
taken I think that could potentially be
 
01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
an option um you know there's a couple
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
of different options I think one could
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
be we
 
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
could complete the audit of this chapter
 
01:07:17.309 --> 01:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
law um based on what information we can
 
01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
audit and then issue a report to comply
 
01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
with the chapter law uh that report
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
would be very limited um because we we
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
can't review much of the information
 
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
that's held by the scholarship
 
01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
organization um I think possibly another
 
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
option is to have this committee um come
 
01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
up with a new audit scope and uh have
 
01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
the um audit scope include a review of
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
the documents at the scholarship
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
organization uh I'm not sure if there's
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
other legal issues that you'd have to um
 
01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
consider in doing that um but that would
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
be the committee's
 
01:08:05.069 --> 01:08:05.079 align:start position:0%
decision rep wler thank you madam chair
 
01:08:07.069 --> 01:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
having read all your audits for the more
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
than 20 years I don't recall any that
 
01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:12.200 align:start position:0%
ever delved into a
 
01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:14.839 align:start position:0%
contractor and many of our functions
 
01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
especially in Dees or de DH
 
01:08:22.269 --> 01:08:22.279 align:start position:0%
HHS are done with contractors and we
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
rely on the
 
01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
agency to monitor to the contractors and
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
so this would be an expansion that I'm
 
01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
not in support of to go after
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
contractors and get down to that level
 
01:08:38.749 --> 01:08:38.759 align:start position:0%
that is done by much of the state work
 
01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
but is not uh looked at by the audit
 
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
division so much as by the department
 
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
that gives the contracts so I'm not in
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
support of of this bill trying to go
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
into that level and I don't think it's
 
01:08:56.189 --> 01:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
01:08:56.199 --> 01:08:57.590 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
representative

01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
Griffin it would thank you madam chair
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that um the contract
 
01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
would have to
 
01:09:09.550 --> 01:09:09.560 align:start position:0%
specifically call for that ability
 
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise I don't I don't see how you
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
get into a
 
01:09:13.199 --> 01:09:14.990 align:start position:0%
get into a
contractor's

01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
contractor's
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
organization I would think from a
 
01:09:19.149 --> 01:09:19.159 align:start position:0%
financial standpoint you might be able
 
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
to turn obtain their audit report and
 
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
rely on that but on a performance uh
 
01:09:29.070 --> 01:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
basis I would think you'd have to have
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
specific language in the contract in
 
01:09:33.789 --> 01:09:33.799 align:start position:0%
order to be able to do
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.709 --> 01:09:41.719 align:start position:0%
Reber um I'm informed without having
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
been able to check it that the chapter
 
01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
law when this was passed um
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
specified that the how the scholarship
 
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
organization is to be
 
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
audited and I wonder if that changes
 
01:09:58.990 --> 01:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
anybody's opinion about
 
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
anything but the issue of transparency
 
01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
here is clearly first and foremost in
 
01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:08.669 align:start position:0%
here is clearly first and foremost in
everybody's

01:10:08.669 --> 01:10:08.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:13.229 --> 01:10:13.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
that um I think an audit typically is
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
I'm a CPA so I'm pretty familiar with
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
Audits and typically an audit is a
 
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
financial audit and I would think it
 
01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
would be proper to ask the the
 
01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
organization to send a copy of their
 
01:10:34.189 --> 01:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
financial audit but when you get into
 
01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
performance audits I think that's a
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
whole different ball
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
game rep Weber if I may what we were
 
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
told was that unless the statute had
 
01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:47.270 align:start position:0%
told was that unless the statute had
specifically

01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:49.960 align:start position:0%
authorized looking at the scholarship
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
organization it could not be done and
 
01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking is if anybody has taken
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
a look at the chapter law because I
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
certainly haven't to see if it contains
 
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
such a specific
 
01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
authorization it doesn't right so again
 
01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
if you look at the 11:35 which is on
 
01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
here the question is on line three right
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
it says that the audit division of the
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
legisl shall complete a performance
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
audit of the Department of Education so
 
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
the question is going to take another
 
01:11:21.229 --> 01:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
step down not given the explicit
 
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
Authority and I I guess I'm agreeing
 
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
with with representative uh wheeler
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
there that you don't you can't take that
 
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
step down we we've authorized only the
 
01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
data that's within their control and we
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
can do performance audit on that data
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure there's legislative
 
01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
authority to take a step down but so
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm confused about is I don't see
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
any directive in the chapter law
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
that wants us to look at the
 
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
contractor the intention of the statute
 
01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
which which by the way went through the
 
01:11:59.550 --> 01:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
house on the consent calendar and a
 
01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
Voice vote in the Senate was very
 
01:12:05.950 --> 01:12:05.960 align:start position:0%
clearly to monitor the department and as
 
01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
I'm looking
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
at um a through
 
01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
G um so a is initial and continued
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
eligibility of
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
participants doesn't the department
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
presumably have a
 
01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
procedure that we
 
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
could audit as to whether or not they
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
were maintaining proper
 
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
oversight of people being eligible and B
 
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
is controls for
 
01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
determining qualifying expenditures I'd
 
01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.910 align:start position:0%
determining qualifying expenditures I'd
be

01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
shocked if the department did not
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
have a policy and procedure for
 
01:12:59.910 --> 01:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
that and just looking at all of them
 
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
they're basic
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
management over sight of a program that
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
I think we expect all of our
 
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
departments to have
 
01:13:16.229 --> 01:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
on every
 
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
program representative if I may I'd like
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
to ask um the senior manager to come up
 
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
and just go through the list of items
 
01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
that we would not be able to audit
 
01:13:29.709 --> 01:13:29.719 align:start position:0%
without further access to the records at
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization okay
 
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
Senator L um yeah well it's not a
 
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
question it's just a statement again
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
under uh 194f R Ral 15 says the
 
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
department shall adopt rules that are
 
01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
necessary for the administration of this
 
01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
chapter and the chapter is EFA program
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
and the scholarship program so I I would
 
01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
anticipate that a performance audit
 
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
would look at the rules that they've
 
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
adopted for the administration of that
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
program and whether or not they're
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
following those rules
 
01:13:58.229 --> 01:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh that go along with that um so there
 
01:14:00.189 --> 01:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
is some provision again again within the
 
01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
agency and it's rules that's done to to
 
01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
implement the law and a performance
 
01:14:06.149 --> 01:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
audit whether or not it's following a
 
01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
the law and B the rules well and in
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
order to do that you'd think that the
 
01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
department would have to get information
 
01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
contractor possibly again that's up to
 
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
the agency and again if it's it's it's
 
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
information within the agency I think
 
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
they'd be obligated to turn it over it's
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
information outside the agency I'm not
 
01:14:28.189 --> 01:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
sure they're obligated to to chase it
 
01:14:30.270 --> 01:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
down because again we're doing that step
 
01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
down into another layer of auditing that
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
isn't even authorized by the statute
 
01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
again the authorization the the 1135
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
authorizes us to to audit them not the
 
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
scholarship program but the contract
 
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
makes clear that all of the data about
 
01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
this program belongs to the
 
01:14:55.149 --> 01:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
state yes good morning um I did I'm
 
01:14:56.629 --> 01:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't know who asked the
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
question about the Department's
 
01:14:59.950 --> 01:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
monitoring but uh we have asked about
 
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
the Department's monitoring introduce
 
01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
yourself oh I'm
 
01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
sorry uh I'm vay skids uh the senior
 
01:15:08.590 --> 01:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
audit manager that's uh been put on this
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
audit um as I was saying the we have
 
01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
asked the department about their
 
01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
monitoring efforts and right now those
 
01:15:18.669 --> 01:15:18.679 align:start position:0%
efforts are in its infant stages um
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
currently the EFA administrator he
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
hasn't been in his position for it's
 
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
been about a year and he started some
 
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
monitoring um so right now he has been
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
looking at some of the El eligibility
 
01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
pieces but he hasn't finished with his
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
report yet so we haven't gotten that
 
01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
report um and as far as the second piece
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
um qualifying expenditures he has just
 
01:15:42.669 --> 01:15:42.679 align:start position:0%
started that process so we don't have
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
access to their monitoring pieces yet
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
because they're not
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't say when the audit
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
has to be done just that
 
01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
the law went into effect October 1 cor
 
01:16:08.189 --> 01:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
right um and uh like Christine had said
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
I can go through some of the pieces that
 
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
we won't be able to look at um based on
 
01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
the current uh situation so you all have
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
a copy of uh HB 1135 or chapter 297 in
 
01:16:22.189 --> 01:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
front of you so I'll just go through
 
01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
each of those um points so the first pie
 
01:16:26.430 --> 01:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
piece is the initial and continued
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
eligibility of participants so without
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
the information that's at the
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%

01:16:34.510 --> 01:16:34.520 align:start position:0%

organization conformed to state laws or
 
01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:43.000 align:start position:0%

continue to meet eligibility criteria uh
 
01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
for receiving differentiated Aid so a

lot of the same limitations that we've
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
I've outlined in A and B apply to this
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
one as
 
01:18:11.229 --> 01:18:11.239 align:start position:0%
well item D procedures and controls for

efas um item e procedures and controls
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
for phase out grants this is an area
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
that uh the department um does so we
 
01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
don't foresee limitations in this
 
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
area uh item F public parti public

outcomes and
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
expenditures uh student outcome data uh
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
is not maintained at the department so
 
01:18:57.550 --> 01:18:57.560 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be able to review those and
 
01:18:59.709 --> 01:18:59.719 align:start position:0%
then item G demographics of qualifying
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
applicants uh the municipality states of
 
01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
residence grade level type of location
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
type in location of educational programs
 
01:19:09.310 --> 01:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
during those two years uh we would not
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
be able to identify the type and
 
01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
location of the educational programs the
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
students are current currently enrolled
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
in and we would not be able to determine
 
01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
whether students still reside in the
 
01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
municipality they did when they
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%

EA
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
questions Senor with yeah
 
01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for this information you
 
01:19:34.990 --> 01:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
know it is pretty it takes my breath
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
away a little bit that the state is our
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are spending millions and
 
01:19:43.229 --> 01:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
millions and millions of dollars on a
 
01:19:45.149 --> 01:19:45.159 align:start position:0%
program that's a that's going to a
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
private organization and it's a complete
 
01:19:51.310 --> 01:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
Black Box and that you're telling us
 
01:19:54.910 --> 01:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
that we have absolutely practically no
 
01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh opportunity to you know exercise our
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
duties to make sure that taxpayer
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
dollars are being spent appropriately it
 
01:20:07.950 --> 01:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
us yes um and I'd also like to add that
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization is willing
 
01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
to assist with the audit as long as they
 
01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:20.639 align:start position:0%
receive the Department's prior written
 
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
approval which is required under Section
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
10.3 of the contract otherwise according
 
01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:28.719 align:start position:0%
to the scholarship organization they
 
01:20:31.390 --> 01:20:31.400 align:start position:0%
cannot permit access to the data as it
 
01:20:33.149 --> 01:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
would violate the
 
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
contract um what pages that of the
 
01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:39.070 align:start position:0%
contract um what pages that of the
contract

01:20:39.070 --> 01:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
contract
 
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:50.189 --> 01:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
right so did I hear you say that the
 
01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
management of this program At Doe is
 
01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:01.480 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I'm sorry um so the EFA
 
01:21:02.910 --> 01:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
administrator the position was
 
01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
authorized I believe June or July of
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
2022 and um the EFA administrator was
 
01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
hired at the end of March 2023 so he's
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
been here for about a year so it's still
 
01:21:17.159 --> 01:21:19.110 align:start position:0%
been here for about a year so it's still
early

01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
early
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
correct questions representative B uh
 
01:21:24.270 --> 01:21:24.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair actually there's a
 
01:21:26.189 --> 01:21:26.199 align:start position:0%
couple of comments on a motion if I
 
01:21:29.790 --> 01:21:29.800 align:start position:0%
might so I just want to point out that
 
01:21:32.590 --> 01:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
if I heard you correctly you're talking
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
about um expanding the scope of the um
 
01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
audit whereas in the previous comments
 
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
the pre discussion about special
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
education that's seem to be out of the
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
realm of consideration which is number
 
01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
one and number two here you want
 
01:21:54.149 --> 01:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
to go and audit the contractor a third
 
01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
party private third party again going
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
back to the previous conversation about
 
01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
special education you explicitly stated
 
01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
it may not have been the two of you but
 
01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:03.669 align:start position:0%
it may not have been the two of you but
the

01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:06.629 --> 01:22:06.639 align:start position:0%
organization um that you wouldn't
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
consider auditing what were actually
 
01:22:10.830 --> 01:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
government entities in terms of the
 
01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
local school districts so I just you
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
don't need to respond to that unless you
 
01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:15.870 align:start position:0%
don't need to respond to that unless you
want

01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
to I just wanted to clarify you
 
01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned that
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
um our office wanted to audit the
 
01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
contractor I'm not quite sure that's the
 
01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
situation I think our um you know intent
 
01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
here was just to let you know that we
 
01:22:35.229 --> 01:22:35.239 align:start position:0%
cannot continue with much of the audit
 
01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
unless we were given access to that
 
01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
information and that is that's the
 
01:22:42.910 --> 01:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
decision of the committee um so I just
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify that follow follow
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay follow up thank you for that
 
01:22:50.189 --> 01:22:50.199 align:start position:0%
clarification because that's that
 
01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
actually goes to my
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
point that
 
01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:58.709 align:start position:0%
point that
you

01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:02.590 --> 01:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
didn't want to go um audit the
 
01:23:04.709 --> 01:23:04.719 align:start position:0%
contractor and yet when we talk about
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
the school boards you specifically don't
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
want to audit I mean not school boards
 
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
the school districts you specifically
 
01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to um out of the contractors
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
so that's fine I think I've made my
 
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
point that and you've made your point
 
01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
which is fantastic may I make a motion
 
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I'd like to hear from the
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
Department thank you and also the
 
01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office
 
01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
you representative Weber has a question
 
01:23:42.910 --> 01:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
that's okay I'm going to have some
 
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
comments first I think it be to start us
 
01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
off because I think there's some
 
01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
information that is inaccurate that's
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
clarify um thank you and 12:30 is at
 
01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
risk at this point don't you
 
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
think uh so if you didn't make comments
 
01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
questions perhaps 12:30 wouldn't be at
 
01:24:08.669 --> 01:24:08.679 align:start position:0%
risk okay I'm G to hand out a handout so
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that you get one of these
 
01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
handouts if you might it is a section of
 
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
the contract that was referred to a
 
01:24:16.750 --> 01:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
number of times and I will get to that
 
01:24:18.990 --> 01:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
you don't have to um grab it immediately
 
01:24:22.189 --> 01:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
but um in essence part of the
 
01:24:23.669 --> 01:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
conversation here comes down to the
 
01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:26.120 align:start position:0%
ownership of data who's who owns this
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
data that is being sought um the
 
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation in 1135 and I'm
 
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
happy to go through that in a couple of
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
different ways um with you um seems
 
01:24:38.270 --> 01:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
quite clear the legislative budget
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
assistant shall complete a performance
 
01:24:41.790 --> 01:24:41.800 align:start position:0%
audit of the department of education
 
01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account program this
 
01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:46.280 align:start position:0%
is an audit of the department it is not
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
an audit of the vendor of the department
 
01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh this audit needs to be directed at
 
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
the processes at the department and I'm
 
01:24:55.709 --> 01:24:55.719 align:start position:0%
happy to go through 1135 and explain to
 
01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
you why I believe that they can meet the
 
01:25:00.910 --> 01:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
obligation their obligation under 1135
 
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
um auditing the department um and really
 
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional argument which I'll
 
01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
reference again a couple different times
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
comes from you know the legislative
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
branch ordering the executive branch to
 
01:25:14.669 --> 01:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
seek information that it does not own
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
from a vendor uh right and so that is uh
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
really what we see as one of the
 
01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
substantive problems here but again just
 
01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
to give you a little background January
 
01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
9th we Pro we had our our initial
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
opening meeting uh the LBA audit
 
01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
division uh first gave us a request for
 
01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
information uh for documents that are
 
01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
not owned um were in the possession of
 
01:25:38.629 --> 01:25:38.639 align:start position:0%
the state and uh you know the department
 
01:25:40.109 --> 01:25:40.119 align:start position:0%
communicated to the Auditors at that
 
01:25:41.629 --> 01:25:41.639 align:start position:0%
time that we believe that the audit
 
01:25:43.109 --> 01:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
scope included the department and not
 
01:25:45.189 --> 01:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
the vendors of the department uh
 
01:25:46.669 --> 01:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
February 13th the department
 
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
communicated that we would not be
 
01:25:50.830 --> 01:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
seeking documents that were not property
 
01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
of the state and not in the possession
 
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
of the state uh we further communicated
 
01:25:57.189 --> 01:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
that the department could not be
 
01:25:59.470 --> 01:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
compelled to seek such information right
 
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
the audit the LBA Auditors don't get to
 
01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
come over to the executive branch to say
 
01:26:04.189 --> 01:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
we want you to go get something that's
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
not yours um in effect this is that
 
01:26:09.870 --> 01:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
separation of powers argument on
 
01:26:11.189 --> 01:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
February when they were no they were
 
01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
that was on February 13th on February
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
27th without the knowledge no knowledge
 
01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
by the department the auditor sent an
 
01:26:20.229 --> 01:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
email directly to the children's
 
01:26:23.070 --> 01:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund indicating that they
 
01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
believe that they had author it to
 
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
obtain this information didn't talk to
 
01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
the department didn't seek our advice or
 
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
whether we believed that we owned it or
 
01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:32.719 align:start position:0%
didn't um and we believe that the
 
01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
Auditors wrongfully stated that all data
 
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
in the possession of the children's
 
01:26:37.870 --> 01:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund were the property of
 
01:26:40.109 --> 01:26:40.119 align:start position:0%
the state and subject to the audit on
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
March 8th as a result of the faulty
 
01:26:44.830 --> 01:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
information that the Auditors provided
 
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
to the children's scholarship fund the
 
01:26:48.510 --> 01:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund stated that
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
if the department gives us permission
 
01:26:51.910 --> 01:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
then we can give this to you but again
 
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
we don't even believe that it is our
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
information so we can't take you know we
 
01:26:57.430 --> 01:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
don't need to Grant permission for that
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
as I'll walk you through the contract in
 
01:27:02.229 --> 01:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
a moment and then finally on uh on March
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
14th um the children's scholarship fund
 
01:27:07.229 --> 01:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
clarified to us their position that the
 
01:27:09.070 --> 01:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
materials were not the property of their
 
01:27:11.189 --> 01:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
state and not subject to delivery of the
 
01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
state and quite frankly um just the
 
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
auditor's inquiry into the children's
 
01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund created a bit of
 
01:27:22.030 --> 01:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
organizational turmoil I'd now like you
 
01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
to turn your attention to uh the handout
 
01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
that I gave you and again the relevant
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
question here is whether the student and
 
01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
family data in the possession of the
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund is the
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
property of the State uh New Hampshire
 
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
Ed the department believes that such
 
01:27:38.430 --> 01:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
data is not the property of the state
 
01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
when the enabling legislation what for
 
01:27:42.270 --> 01:27:42.280 align:start position:0%
this program was first established the
 
01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
legislature deliberately separated the
 
01:27:47.470 --> 01:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
functions of the state New Hampshire
 
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and a
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization to whom much of
 
01:27:52.590 --> 01:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for the
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
administration of the program was
 
01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:55.189 align:start position:0%
administration of the program was
delegated

01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
delegated
 
01:27:56.910 --> 01:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
uh the statute is quite clear about the
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
various obligations for each of those
 
01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
entities given this direction in the
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
legislature uh New Hampshire the
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Education entered into a
 
01:28:07.229 --> 01:28:07.239 align:start position:0%
contract with the children's scholarship
 
01:28:09.229 --> 01:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
fund the terms of this contract
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
establish that at a minimum personally
 
01:28:13.390 --> 01:28:13.400 align:start position:0%
identifiable data generated by this
 
01:28:14.830 --> 01:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
contract is the property of the
 
01:28:17.470 --> 01:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund or not but
 
01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
certainly not the state's property um if
 
01:28:21.870 --> 01:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
this were not the case New Hampshire
 
01:28:23.070 --> 01:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Education would have
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
required a number of contractual
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
Provisions relative to uh the protection

of person ID identifiable information
 
01:28:32.189 --> 01:28:32.199 align:start position:0%
including all of the doit contract
 
01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
specifications and the governor and
 
01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
Council would have required such things
 
01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
as well finally in its ongoing
 
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
relationship with the children's
 
01:28:41.709 --> 01:28:41.719 align:start position:0%
scholarship funds including monitoring
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
the program thank you Senator Rosen um
 
01:28:47.070 --> 01:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
you know the uh the children's
 
01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund has continue to assert
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
that this is not property of the uh the
 
01:28:56.990 --> 01:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
state um now in on uh February 27th the
 
01:28:59.709 --> 01:28:59.719 align:start position:0%
Auditors sent an email and made an
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
assertion that the data held by the
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund was property
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
of the state such assertion contradicts
 
01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
new H the Department's understanding of
 
01:29:12.990 --> 01:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
the contract and contradicts uh these
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
actions the legislative actions as well
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
as the actions uh of how we've operated
 
01:29:19.229 --> 01:29:19.239 align:start position:0%
for the first three years and if you'll
 
01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
notice in the email that um the auditor
 
01:29:25.149 --> 01:29:25.159 align:start position:0%
sent initially
 
01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
and I'll pull this up they point to
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph 10.1 which is in the handout
 
01:29:32.750 --> 01:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
that you have you all have 10.1 and if
 
01:29:37.109 --> 01:29:37.119 align:start position:0%
you read 10.1 10.1 States a very broad
 
01:29:39.790 --> 01:29:39.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know um cast a very broad net it
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
says as used in this agreement the word
 
01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
data shall mean all information and
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
things developed or obtained during the
 
01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
performance of or acquired or developed
 
01:29:52.629 --> 01:29:52.639 align:start position:0%
by reason of this agreement including
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
but not limited to all studies reports
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%

computer printouts notes letters I
 
01:30:08.189 --> 01:30:08.199 align:start position:0%
assume that could mean emails uh
 
01:30:10.669 --> 01:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
memorandum papers and documents all
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
whether finished or unfinished and then
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
in the second thing if you read if you
 
01:30:18.109 --> 01:30:18.119 align:start position:0%
continue the assertion was that well
 
01:30:20.590 --> 01:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
this is data therefore must be property
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
of the state and so they go to 10.2 and
 
01:30:27.109 --> 01:30:27.119 align:start position:0%
it says all data and any property which
 
01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
has been received from the state or
 
01:30:31.149 --> 01:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
purchased with funds provided for that
 
01:30:33.229 --> 01:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
purpose under this agreement shall be
 
01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
the property of the state and shall be
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
returned to the state upon demand or
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
upon termination of this agreement for
 
01:30:42.189 --> 01:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
any reason um and then they point in 20
 
01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
in three that the the data can be
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
disclosed upon written uh approval so
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
NHS understanding of this contractual
 
01:30:51.070 --> 01:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
provision which is consistent with both
 
01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
its and the actions of the children's
 
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund to date are that the
 
01:30:57.550 --> 01:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
property does not belong to the state it
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
reads look at Care at uh 10.2 very
 
01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
carefully it reads all data and property
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
which has been received from the state
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
or purchased with funds provided for
 
01:31:10.990 --> 01:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
that purpose under this agreement and
 
01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
that is a very standard contractual term
 
01:31:17.709 --> 01:31:17.719 align:start position:0%
um notice that it doesn't say all data
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
Comm it says all data and property which
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
has been received so it's modified IED
 
01:31:26.830 --> 01:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
there um so V seems to think that all
 
01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
data in 10.1 as well as any property
 
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
which has been received from the state
 
01:31:32.990 --> 01:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
or purchase with funds provided for that
 
01:31:34.830 --> 01:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
purpose under this agreement is property
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
of the state and this contradicts Common
 
01:31:40.990 --> 01:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
Sense quite frankly it results in just
 
01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
an absurd application under the contract
 
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
which no one's going to believe right
 
01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:46.280 align:start position:0%
they're basically saying imagine if I
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
went to all of my contractors and said
 
01:31:49.870 --> 01:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
all the emails that you ever wrote about
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
this contract those are the property of
 
01:31:53.109 --> 01:31:53.119 align:start position:0%
the state every note that you took in a
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
meeting relative this contract that
 
01:31:57.149 --> 01:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
becomes property of the state that's not
 
01:31:59.310 --> 01:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
can't possibly be the meaning associated
 
01:32:00.629 --> 01:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
with this and everybody knows that in a
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
typical contract right you have a
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
contract and we're saying like all data
 
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
that we give you and all data that we
 
01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
pay for you to develop that's the
 
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
property of the state not all data
 
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
associated with this contract and so New
 
01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire believes that all data and
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
property are modified by received from
 
01:32:19.709 --> 01:32:19.719 align:start position:0%
the state or purchase blah BL blah such
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
reading is the practical application of
 
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
the language that any data provided to
 
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
the vendor or purchased on behalf of the
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
contract can be demanded by the state
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
and must be returned to the state upon
 
01:32:33.229 --> 01:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
termination um and this understanding is
 
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
also grammatically correct again it
 
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't State all data comma and any
 
01:32:39.870 --> 01:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
property but States all data and
 
01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
property without the comma establishing
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
that the modifier of which has been
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
received from the state or purchased
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
with funds provided for that purpose
 
01:32:49.790 --> 01:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
applies to both data and property right
 
01:32:51.070 --> 01:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
they're not trying to sweep up
 
01:32:53.070 --> 01:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
everything that's ever happened at the
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
uh at the you know from the agreement
 
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly this entire thing
 
01:32:57.629 --> 01:32:57.639 align:start position:0%
could have if the Auditors had
 
01:32:59.070 --> 01:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
communicated with us and talked to us we
 
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
could have clarified this for them um
 
01:33:04.149 --> 01:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
and so imagine the Absurd application
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
that would mean that I have a contract
 
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
with tutor.com can I go to tutor.com and
 
01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
say like I want all of the personal
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
identifiable information of every
 
01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
student and teacher that has ever done
 
01:33:15.470 --> 01:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
tutoring of course I can't right I
 
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
didn't provide that data how about if I
 
01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
go to discovery.com I got 1.2 million
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
teachers and Educators using that
 
01:33:24.109 --> 01:33:24.119 align:start position:0%
program across the state and allowed to
 
01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
go to Discovery and say I want every
 
01:33:27.229 --> 01:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
single email that's ever been written I
 
01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
think that that's an absurd application
 
01:33:32.030 --> 01:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
of this contract and and and quite
 
01:33:33.870 --> 01:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
frankly doesn't make any sense and then
 
01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
I just want to I want to step back again
 
01:33:40.109 --> 01:33:40.119 align:start position:0%
as well and just reflect on additional
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
scoping relative to this audit I was
 
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
shocked to learn the other day that the
 
01:33:47.310 --> 01:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
Auditors have sought access from the
 
01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
Department's food and nutrition program
 
01:33:51.149 --> 01:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
under the premise that they can learn
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
something from how schools qualify
 
01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
students for free and reded and reduced
 
01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
price meal eligibility and quite frankly
 
01:33:59.870 --> 01:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know why they're there they have
 
01:34:01.950 --> 01:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
now sought and met with my reading
 
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
Specialists they've s and met again with
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
special education as if those guys
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
haven't been audited twice already is
 
01:34:10.350 --> 01:34:10.360 align:start position:0%
enough um and so like I just am
 
01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
concerned that we are almost it feels
 
01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
like a little bit of a fishing
 
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
Expedition I'm going to tell you how
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
they can meet their obligations in a
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
moment but then the last thing that I
 
01:34:19.109 --> 01:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
will talk about is and this was quite
 
01:34:21.229 --> 01:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
disturbing is that it was communicated
 
01:34:24.030 --> 01:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
to staff of the department that when the
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
Auditors want to interview with staff
 
01:34:28.990 --> 01:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
members it is not permissible to have
 
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
their supervisor present and the belief
 
01:34:34.189 --> 01:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
was that they didn't want the supervisor
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
present because maybe they would not say
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
something they would be you know feel
 
01:34:39.910 --> 01:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
like they have to be nefarious or
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
something quite frankly we're trying to
 
01:34:43.629 --> 01:34:43.639 align:start position:0%
work with the Auditors to make sure that
 
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
we roll out an effective program that
 
01:34:49.070 --> 01:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
serves the needs of the students and I I
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
take offense at that um you know kind of
 
01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
a policy and i' I've worked in this
 
01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
field for many many years and I can tell
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
you that of course you want the a the if
 
01:34:58.830 --> 01:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
a supervisor thinks they need to be
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
there to make sure that the Auditors get
 
01:35:02.109 --> 01:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
accurate information that should be the
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
case if the supervisor thinks that the
 
01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
individual is has you know been in the
 
01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
job long enough to be able to do it they
 
01:35:09.229 --> 01:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
can go ahead and do it but now if I come
 
01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
back to uh 11:35 you know the Auditors
 
01:35:15.790 --> 01:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
of the department and the if you look
 
01:35:17.070 --> 01:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
through these things the initial and
 
01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
continued eligibility of departments we
 
01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
have a monitoring program that is
 
01:35:22.350 --> 01:35:22.360 align:start position:0%
monitoring both the initial and the
 
01:35:24.030 --> 01:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
continued eligibility of IND individuals
 
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
in the department and we are doing that
 
01:35:27.870 --> 01:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
we have controls to determine that the
 
01:35:29.709 --> 01:35:29.719 align:start position:0%
expenses that are being approved are
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
qualified we have procedures and
 
01:35:33.310 --> 01:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
controls for transferring funds to the
 
01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
scholarship or actually I skipped one uh
 
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
controls for determining qualifying
 
01:35:38.669 --> 01:35:38.679 align:start position:0%
expense identify and recovering
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
ineligible expenses every year we go
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
through a very extensive reconciliation
 
01:35:43.950 --> 01:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
with the scholarship organization and
 
01:35:45.229 --> 01:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
they're happy to come in they can see
 
01:35:46.709 --> 01:35:46.719 align:start position:0%
all the documentation we have relative
 
01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
to that and they can take a look at it
 
01:35:51.109 --> 01:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
um you know procedures and controls for
 
01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
transferring FRS to the scholarship
 
01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
organization again I have to authorize
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
that transfer I sign off on it there is
 
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
plenty of documentation that takes place
 
01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
at the department R to to my sign off to
 
01:36:02.109 --> 01:36:02.119 align:start position:0%
make sure that the amount of funds that
 
01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
we're transferring is the appropriate
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
amount and then the subsequent
 
01:36:06.669 --> 01:36:06.679 align:start position:0%
reconciliations to make sure that we
 
01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
know where those funds ended up um you
 
01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
know public reporting in terms of
 
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
participation student outcomes and
 
01:36:13.709 --> 01:36:13.719 align:start position:0%
expenditures we have quite a bit of
 
01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:15.880 align:start position:0%
public reporting uh we release
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
demographic reports on a regular basis
 
01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
so I believe that there is plenty of
 
01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
audit available and I believe that they
 
01:36:25.109 --> 01:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
can meet their obligations and we
 
01:36:28.350 --> 01:36:28.360 align:start position:0%
believe that the statute does not allow
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
them to go to a vendor and seek
 
01:36:33.149 --> 01:36:33.159 align:start position:0%
information that is not the property of
 
01:36:35.709 --> 01:36:35.719 align:start position:0%
the state um and so those are my my
 
01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
comments before I recognize Senator
 
01:36:42.149 --> 01:36:42.159 align:start position:0%
Whitley for question yes I just want to
 
01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
say that I think all of us in this room
 
01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
have deep respect for the
 
01:36:51.629 --> 01:36:51.639 align:start position:0%
professionalism of the
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
LBA both the budget Division and the
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
audit division and I am sure you are not
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
implying anything other than that
 
01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely not 100% I have the same
 
01:37:05.950 --> 01:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
respect and I actually think that this
 
01:37:08.430 --> 01:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
can be a real opportunity to try and
 
01:37:10.149 --> 01:37:10.159 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're implementing a
 
01:37:12.310 --> 01:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
program a new program for the state in
 
01:37:15.790 --> 01:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
its infancy so to speak um to be able to
 
01:37:18.030 --> 01:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that we set it on a right
 
01:37:20.229 --> 01:37:20.239 align:start position:0%
course from the beginning and I share
 
01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
that that interest and I'm happy to kind
 
01:37:26.229 --> 01:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
of work toward W that uh I am concerned
 
01:37:29.070 --> 01:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
when there are engagements with my staff
 
01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
there are engagements with vendors that
 
01:37:33.189 --> 01:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
seem to go beyond that and and lack some
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
degree of communication Senator Whitley
 
01:37:38.590 --> 01:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I that was a in my
 
01:37:40.510 --> 01:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
opinion a full scale attack on the LBA
 
01:37:41.790 --> 01:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
and I would like them to come up and
 
01:37:43.709 --> 01:37:43.719 align:start position:0%
respond please because I I think that's
 
01:37:45.310 --> 01:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
very appropriate before we do additional
 
01:37:49.589 --> 01:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
question we do that I just want to ask
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
you about section 10.2 yes
 
01:37:58.669 --> 01:37:58.679 align:start position:0%
the way I read it that little or in the
 
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
second line is little but it's
 
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
incredibly powerful because it puts
 
01:38:10.189 --> 01:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
equal weight on what comes before it and
 
01:38:13.870 --> 01:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
what comes after it because it is not a
 
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
restrictive Clause so all data and any
 
01:38:21.669 --> 01:38:21.679 align:start position:0%
property which has been received from
 
01:38:21.679 --> 01:38:22.430 align:start position:0%
property which has been received from
the

01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
state is one and two or has been
 
01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
purchased with funds provided for the
 
01:38:34.270 --> 01:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
purpose under this
 
01:38:39.070 --> 01:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
agreement is has equal weight to shall
 
01:38:42.669 --> 01:38:42.679 align:start position:0%
be the property of the state so I I
 
01:38:46.750 --> 01:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
think you're misreading it
 
01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:48.830 align:start position:0%
think you're misreading it
grammatically

01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
grammatically
 
01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:52.360 align:start position:0%
which we could we could argue grammar
 
01:38:54.589 --> 01:38:54.599 align:start position:0%
but i' probably spend more time teaching
 
01:38:57.390 --> 01:38:57.400 align:start position:0%
writing than you actually I ma'am could
 
01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
you introduce yourself I can Elizabeth
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
Brown I'm Council for the Department of
 
01:39:03.589 --> 01:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
Education and I actually think your
 
01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
reading actually AIDS the department
 
01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
even more than um our prior reading
 
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
because if you read that it's if that is
 
01:39:12.910 --> 01:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
or purchased with funds for the state
 
01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
it's it has to be data or property
 
01:39:17.149 --> 01:39:17.159 align:start position:0%
received from the state and I'm going to
 
01:39:19.350 --> 01:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
take a little step back and I actually
 
01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
will then will give you all a handout
 
01:39:23.629 --> 01:39:23.639 align:start position:0%
because this statute is very different
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
the way the program for the EFA program
 
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
was designed by the legislature is very
 
01:39:30.910 --> 01:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
different than probably any other
 
01:39:32.669 --> 01:39:32.679 align:start position:0%
program that is being administered in
 
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
the state the department has a couple of
 
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
obligations under this statute and the
 
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization by Design and
 
01:39:45.070 --> 01:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature designed this
 
01:39:47.229 --> 01:39:47.239 align:start position:0%
program um gave the scholarship
 
01:39:49.149 --> 01:39:49.159 align:start position:0%
organization a number of duties and
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities with respect to
 
01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
administering the program
 
01:39:56.830 --> 01:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
and you can see that um very clearly in
 
01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
194 F4 um Roman numeral F1 Roman numeral
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
7 which basically says the scholarship
 
01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
or organization is the um Department
 
01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:11.159 align:start position:0%
that implements and administers the one
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
night the program so I think this is
 
01:40:16.109 --> 01:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
this is a bit different and this is why
 
01:40:20.109 --> 01:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
it is um important to understand that
 
01:40:22.669 --> 01:40:22.679 align:start position:0%
this whole program is set up by the
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
legislature in order to bifurcate the
 
01:40:28.229 --> 01:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
information because the scholarship
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
organization is receiving like because I
 
01:40:32.109 --> 01:40:32.119 align:start position:0%
don't think this is made this point has
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
been made here either by the legislators
 
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
or by my uh commissioner the type of
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
information that the scholarship
 
01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
organization has is deeply personal and
 
01:40:43.709 --> 01:40:43.719 align:start position:0%
deeply private and I believe that is why
 
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
the legislature in their Prudence
 
01:40:48.109 --> 01:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
decided to bifurcate this the
 
01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
information that the EFA administrator
 
01:40:52.750 --> 01:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
has the scholarship organization has is
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
student data and tax returns from our
 
01:40:59.189 --> 01:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in order to determine whether
 
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
or not they're eligible that is not the
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
kind of information that our department
 
01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
manages ever we don't have student level
 
01:41:09.030 --> 01:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
data we don't have individual taxpayer
 
01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
information and I actually think our
 
01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers might be somewhat offended if
 
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
they found out that we had General
 
01:41:17.310 --> 01:41:17.320 align:start position:0%
access to that information this was put
 
01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
behind the the protections of the
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization in order to
 
01:41:24.109 --> 01:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
keep that information private and to
 
01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
keep it out of the hands of the
 
01:41:28.350 --> 01:41:28.360 align:start position:0%
government that was done by Design um so
 
01:41:30.149 --> 01:41:30.159 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure that I that I
 
01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
actually believe your reading is also
 
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
consistent with our reading that that
 
01:41:37.149 --> 01:41:37.159 align:start position:0%
information those tax returns and that
 
01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh student information is not government
 
01:41:41.790 --> 01:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
information and that data does never
 
01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
become data of the department because we
 
01:41:48.109 --> 01:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
did not purchase it um and it was
 
01:41:50.189 --> 01:41:50.199 align:start position:0%
provided directly by individual
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and parents to the scholarship
 
01:41:54.270 --> 01:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
organization and order to determine
 
01:41:55.950 --> 01:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
their children's eligibility for the
 
01:41:57.790 --> 01:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
program and that was all by the design
 
01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
of the legislature if I could I would
 
01:42:04.189 --> 01:42:04.199 align:start position:0%
hand out uh 194f copies just for your
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
information um if you can please take
 
01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
one I think so you wouldn't be able to
 
01:42:11.310 --> 01:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
get deidentified
 
01:42:16.229 --> 01:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
data on where where the students lived
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
or what the income
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
levels were so the the the the 800 r and
 
01:42:24.990 --> 01:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
we may be answering this slightly
 
01:42:27.709 --> 01:42:27.719 align:start position:0%
differently but the so one of our
 
01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
obligations under 194f was to develop
 
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
administrative rules we did that the
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that are applicable
 
01:42:40.270 --> 01:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
to the EFA program you can find in
 
01:42:43.629 --> 01:42:43.639 align:start position:0%
ed800 under ed800 there are certain
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements of the
 
01:42:47.669 --> 01:42:47.679 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization back to the
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
department and includes much of the
 
01:42:52.109 --> 01:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
information that you are asking
 
01:42:52.119 --> 01:42:53.709 align:start position:0%
information that you are asking
for

01:42:53.709 --> 01:42:53.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:42:57.910 --> 01:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
so you can get the information for the
 
01:43:02.790 --> 01:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
audit we're it's clear that the bill
 
01:43:05.229 --> 01:43:05.239 align:start position:0%
that was passed does not ask for an
 
01:43:07.589 --> 01:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
audit of the scholarship
 
01:43:10.910 --> 01:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
oration it ask for an audit of the
 
01:43:13.350 --> 01:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
Department's oversight that's clear I
 
01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
don't think anyone is
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
suggesting that there's an intention to
 
01:43:24.750 --> 01:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
go so we agree I I I don't see that any
 
01:43:26.350 --> 01:43:26.360 align:start position:0%
where who a
 
01:43:29.669 --> 01:43:29.679 align:start position:0%
question oh Senator Lang and then Weber
 
01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:32.360 align:start position:0%
and then I I just have a procedural
 
01:43:33.629 --> 01:43:33.639 align:start position:0%
question about where we're going with
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
this committee and this conversation
 
01:43:38.709 --> 01:43:38.719 align:start position:0%
because again um this is a statutory
 
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
audit right so it's not whether or not
 
01:43:42.109 --> 01:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
we want to do the audit we have to do
 
01:43:44.350 --> 01:43:44.360 align:start position:0%
the AIT we have to do the audit right
 
01:43:46.229 --> 01:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
right now we're
 
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
we right now we're trying to play parent
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
between two siblings it sounds like
 
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
between the LBA and the and the and the
 
01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
doe and trying to referee what is in
 
01:43:59.390 --> 01:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
scope and what's out of scope um so I
 
01:44:01.390 --> 01:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
guess my question is what's the role of
 
01:44:03.589 --> 01:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
this Committee in this conversation um
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
we've approved the scope LBA has it they
 
01:44:07.709 --> 01:44:07.719 align:start position:0%
should complete the audit as much as
 
01:44:08.830 --> 01:44:08.840 align:start position:0%
they can with the data that they're
 
01:44:10.629 --> 01:44:10.639 align:start position:0%
willing to provide if they want to do
 
01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
something with the Department then
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's their obligation to do it I'm
 
01:44:15.189 --> 01:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand what our role
 
01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
is in this
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
conversation well I think our
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
our um Charter is
 
01:44:28.149 --> 01:44:28.159 align:start position:0%
to ask for a performance
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
audit that look at how departments are
 
01:44:36.430 --> 01:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
implementing the
 
01:44:38.470 --> 01:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
will of the
 
01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
legis and the legislature's will was go
 
01:44:47.830 --> 01:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
do this program so it's certainly a
 
01:44:50.589 --> 01:44:50.599 align:start position:0%
right to ask
 
01:44:54.189 --> 01:44:54.199 align:start position:0%
for information on how the
 
01:44:54.199 --> 01:44:55.830 align:start position:0%
for information on how the
Department's

01:44:55.830 --> 01:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
Department's
 
01:45:00.189 --> 01:45:00.199 align:start position:0%
asking how it's implementing it so can I
 
01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
again this is a question of process not
 
01:45:04.030 --> 01:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily a question of as I read this
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
again no you're correct normally under
 
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
the statute for our performance audit
 
01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
committee we recommend audits to the
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
phisical committee who goes goes about
 
01:45:13.990 --> 01:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
it that's the normal process we're
 
01:45:15.270 --> 01:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
outside of the normal process because
 
01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
now we have a statute that requires a
 
01:45:19.629 --> 01:45:19.639 align:start position:0%
performance audit that isn't in here we
 
01:45:21.229 --> 01:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
even if we want to say no we can't
 
01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
because we have a law that says we're
 
01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
compelled to do one um and so we can't
 
01:45:27.629 --> 01:45:27.639 align:start position:0%
say no to the audit um the question is
 
01:45:29.310 --> 01:45:29.320 align:start position:0%
what the audit contains and so we're
 
01:45:32.669 --> 01:45:32.679 align:start position:0%
we're subject to 1131 uh 1135 Roman
 
01:45:34.589 --> 01:45:34.599 align:start position:0%
numeral 2 it says the legislative budget
 
01:45:36.350 --> 01:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
assistant shall submit audit scope
 
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
statement to the legislative performance
 
01:45:39.550 --> 01:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
audit committee for review and approval
 
01:45:42.350 --> 01:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
and submit the final report to the um to
 
01:45:44.229 --> 01:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee and da we've
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
already done our part right we've
 
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
already reviewed the scope we've already
 
01:45:49.750 --> 01:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
reviewed so now it just up to the
 
01:45:53.550 --> 01:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
agencies to do it um what we've said and
 
01:45:55.950 --> 01:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm trying to understand are we
 
01:45:58.109 --> 01:45:58.119 align:start position:0%
talking about now revising the scope
 
01:45:59.669 --> 01:45:59.679 align:start position:0%
after we've already approved it is that
 
01:46:02.950 --> 01:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
the discussion because no we didn't do a
 
01:46:06.589 --> 01:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
mad this came through by right San with
 
01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:09.239 align:start position:0%
me Madam chair I to clarify I think what
 
01:46:12.589 --> 01:46:12.599 align:start position:0%
we are doing right now we right we have
 
01:46:14.830 --> 01:46:14.840 align:start position:0%
we scope is decided not by us the scope
 
01:46:17.229 --> 01:46:17.239 align:start position:0%
is what it is but this is a very
 
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
important conversation because we're
 
01:46:20.669 --> 01:46:20.679 align:start position:0%
hearing from the LBA that the department
 
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
of Ed is sort of blocking the
 
01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:24.719 align:start position:0%
information that they need to conduct
 
01:46:26.510 --> 01:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
the audit that's what we're discussing
 
01:46:28.510 --> 01:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
right now and maybe we need to get the
 
01:46:30.629 --> 01:46:30.639 align:start position:0%
LBA back up to sort of confirm that but
 
01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing is that we have a very
 
01:46:34.830 --> 01:46:34.840 align:start position:0%
clear scope we're not arguing about
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
scope but LBA is saying that they cannot
 
01:46:39.669 --> 01:46:39.679 align:start position:0%
get the information that they need to
 
01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
complete it
 
01:46:44.589 --> 01:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
without uh cooperation from the
 
01:46:46.589 --> 01:46:46.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed and to be clear our
 
01:46:48.149 --> 01:46:48.159 align:start position:0%
position is that we don't own nor do we
 
01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
have access to that
 
01:46:53.109 --> 01:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
data okay mad I go back to I go back
 
01:46:55.470 --> 01:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
what's our role here um the scope's been
 
01:46:58.390 --> 01:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
defined by Statute uh um the agencies
 
01:47:01.390 --> 01:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
are going through it what vote could we
 
01:47:03.510 --> 01:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
possibly take in this committee to
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
change anything in the outcome of this
 
01:47:06.589 --> 01:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
conversation our role is public
 
01:47:08.109 --> 01:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
discourse so the public needs to hear
 
01:47:09.629 --> 01:47:09.639 align:start position:0%
about this I
 
01:47:14.910 --> 01:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
mean um the contract clearly states that
 
01:47:19.629 --> 01:47:19.639 align:start position:0%
the state owns the data I mean I I just
 
01:47:21.310 --> 01:47:21.320 align:start position:0%
don't think there's
 
01:47:24.589 --> 01:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
another way to read it because of that
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
or whether or not the department chooses
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
to ask for it it's a completely
 
01:47:33.870 --> 01:47:33.880 align:start position:0%
different issue I don't know why you
 
01:47:35.870 --> 01:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't but so so respectfully we
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
disagree and we have sought legal
 
01:47:38.750 --> 01:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
counsel as well as the Attorney
 
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
General's office and and information on
 
01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:41.750 align:start position:0%
General's office and and information on
this

01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:47:46.109 --> 01:47:46.119 align:start position:0%
so okay representative
 
01:47:49.229 --> 01:47:49.239 align:start position:0%
Weber I'm sorry following up on Senator
 
01:47:52.510 --> 01:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
Lang's Point uh we have two different
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
things going here we have the audit as
 
01:47:57.189 --> 01:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
it was mandated by Statute which has to
 
01:48:01.470 --> 01:48:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:05.790 --> 01:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
format and at that point this committee
 
01:48:09.229 --> 01:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
or even before it is completed this
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
committee has the authority to ask for
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
different audits different parameters
 
01:48:22.589 --> 01:48:22.599 align:start position:0%
different conditions so uh if if I think
 
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
that that is our our remedy if if we
 
01:48:29.470 --> 01:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
want to do some changes I mean it sounds
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
to me like there's every opportunity
 
01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:35.719 align:start position:0%
here to get a third branch of government
 
01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
involved in deciding who has the
 
01:48:42.430 --> 01:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
authority to say who can do which and
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
one would fervently hope that that is
 
01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:46.189 align:start position:0%
one would fervently hope that that is
not

01:48:46.189 --> 01:48:46.199 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:48:48.910 --> 01:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
necessary uh because I personally
 
01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
speaking only for myself would fervently
 
01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
hope that with a program of this size
 
01:48:56.950 --> 01:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
and scope and
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
importance and
 
01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
expense that the department would take
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
the pro the the position that
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
transparency is Paramount and when I say
 
01:49:14.030 --> 01:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
that I am not asking for individuals tax
 
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
returns or anything else the audit
 
01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
division audits all kinds of incredibly
 
01:49:24.830 --> 01:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
personal sensitive information from all
 
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
kinds of sources all the time and they
 
01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
have Professional Standards that require
 
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
them to keep anything that is
 
01:49:35.109 --> 01:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
confidential confidential it's only what
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
they use in
 
01:49:41.109 --> 01:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
evaluating whether the
 
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
statutory mandates put on an agency are
 
01:49:48.350 --> 01:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
being followed
 
01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:51.679 align:start position:0%
so that's just personal opinion and I'm
 
01:49:53.470 --> 01:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
having let it out I'm going to leave it
 
01:49:55.750 --> 01:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
there and hope that we hear from the
 
01:49:58.510 --> 01:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
audit division because I think the
 
01:50:00.390 --> 01:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
position of the Department of Education
 
01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
is sufficiently clear whether I agree
 
01:50:05.310 --> 01:50:05.320 align:start position:0%
with it or not but and so again we don't
 
01:50:06.830 --> 01:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
believe we own the data we believe that
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
they can meet the obligations of the
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
statute auditing the department as it's
 
01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
enumerated in
 
01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
statute mad Madam chair before you get
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
to the LBA shouldn't we hear from the
 
01:50:21.310 --> 01:50:21.320 align:start position:0%
AG's office the ag office the LBA back
 
01:50:23.790 --> 01:50:23.800 align:start position:0%
first one question
 
01:50:26.669 --> 01:50:26.679 align:start position:0%
yes one more question question so again
 
01:50:26.679 --> 01:50:28.350 align:start position:0%
yes one more question question so again
putting

01:50:28.350 --> 01:50:28.360 align:start position:0%
putting
 
01:50:31.229 --> 01:50:31.239 align:start position:0%
dat when you're you're under that
 
01:50:33.629 --> 01:50:33.639 align:start position:0%
10.2 you're more than willing that any
 
01:50:35.669 --> 01:50:35.679 align:start position:0%
data that you've given to the to the
 
01:50:36.870 --> 01:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
scholarship commission you're willing to
 
01:50:40.109 --> 01:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
share with the with LBA that's your data
 
01:50:42.030 --> 01:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
correct my data we 100% will be
 
01:50:43.589 --> 01:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
providing all of that information as
 
01:50:45.149 --> 01:50:45.159 align:start position:0%
requested thank
 
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
you um I'll just mention that I've seen
 
01:50:54.870 --> 01:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
a bureau of elderly an adult Services
 
01:50:59.270 --> 01:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
performance audit which also deals that
 
01:51:01.550 --> 01:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
department deals with social security
 
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
numbers and income and very sensitive
 
01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
personal health information and there's
 
01:51:12.990 --> 01:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
never been a question
 
01:51:16.990 --> 01:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
of um making any
 
01:51:20.910 --> 01:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
individuals information public through
 
01:51:25.629 --> 01:51:25.639 align:start position:0%
that audit so the LBA like to respond to
 
01:51:25.639 --> 01:51:27.750 align:start position:0%
that audit so the LBA like to respond to
those

01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
charges yes I I'll provide a response
 
01:51:32.430 --> 01:51:32.440 align:start position:0%
but first my name is Michael Kain uh the
 
01:51:35.189 --> 01:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistant um just a
 
01:51:36.830 --> 01:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
couple things that we don't take
 
01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
anything as an attack personally I don't
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
I talk to my staff we do operat as an
 
01:51:43.990 --> 01:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
office any uh decision that our Auditors
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
make I take personal responsibility for
 
01:51:48.069 --> 01:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
if there is an disagreement with the
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
Department we reach out uh I have had
 
01:51:52.350 --> 01:51:52.360 align:start position:0%
discussions with the attorney general's
 
01:51:53.990 --> 01:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
office is to make sure that we're both
 
01:51:56.750 --> 01:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
parties are on the same page um I do not
 
01:52:00.990 --> 01:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
want to characterize uh doe as blocking
 
01:52:03.229 --> 01:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
our access to any information I think
 
01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
it's a very important question I think
 
01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
Christopher Von's uh behind me but it's
 
01:52:10.229 --> 01:52:10.239 align:start position:0%
it's a very important um what you were
 
01:52:11.629 --> 01:52:11.639 align:start position:0%
talking about the provision of the
 
01:52:14.229 --> 01:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
contract and information that's really
 
01:52:16.990 --> 01:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
contractual law what is the uh what are
 
01:52:20.990 --> 01:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
the rights of the in the the access of
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
the actual contractor but what does the
 
01:52:24.990 --> 01:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
department have access to that is a
 
01:52:26.669 --> 01:52:26.679 align:start position:0%
legal question we have to be very
 
01:52:29.589 --> 01:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
careful with there in just to point out
 
01:52:31.390 --> 01:52:31.400 align:start position:0%
we're not moving forward with anything
 
01:52:33.470 --> 01:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
today we're providing you with an update
 
01:52:35.350 --> 01:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
we do have to come back pursuant to that
 
01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
chapter law to have you approve a scope
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
before we me move forward we're very
 
01:52:41.629 --> 01:52:41.639 align:start position:0%
very early in the process this is a very
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
important conversation to have as we
 
01:52:46.069 --> 01:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
move forward uh what information are we
 
01:52:48.069 --> 01:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
able to access and I I think the
 
01:52:49.870 --> 01:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
Attorney General can kind of clarify
 
01:52:52.870 --> 01:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
that um and then after that we have to
 
01:52:54.910 --> 01:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
work very closely with the department to
 
01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
get that information as um our auditor
 
01:52:59.709 --> 01:52:59.719 align:start position:0%
had stated the department of education
 
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
does have an oversite they do have a new
 
01:53:03.550 --> 01:53:03.560 align:start position:0%
employee uh who is performing a lot of
 
01:53:05.069 --> 01:53:05.079 align:start position:0%
the work who has been there for under a
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
year uh as you said Senator Rose Maul
 
01:53:08.830 --> 01:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
there was an effective date but there's
 
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
no deadline there's no demand date when
 
01:53:13.069 --> 01:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
this has to be done by when we have to
 
01:53:14.910 --> 01:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
start I think there are a lot of things
 
01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
that are still going on right now that
 
01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
have to be clarified um I do just want
 
01:53:20.189 --> 01:53:20.199 align:start position:0%
to point out to the department to the
 
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner and to his employees we
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
really do app appreciate the efforts
 
01:53:25.149 --> 01:53:25.159 align:start position:0%
they've taken over the last two years we
 
01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
have been there over two years on
 
01:53:29.310 --> 01:53:29.320 align:start position:0%
various audits uh we're directed by you
 
01:53:31.830 --> 01:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
as well as legisl we really appreciate
 
01:53:33.550 --> 01:53:33.560 align:start position:0%
them working with us and providing the
 
01:53:37.109 --> 01:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
information um it's a lot of information
 
01:53:39.310 --> 01:53:39.320 align:start position:0%
that we ask the audit process is very
 
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
difficult it's very difficult for the
 
01:53:43.149 --> 01:53:43.159 align:start position:0%
audit to perform their daily functions
 
01:53:45.589 --> 01:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
on top of monitoring legislation court
 
01:53:48.629 --> 01:53:48.639 align:start position:0%
cases and everything and we respect that
 
01:53:50.229 --> 01:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
um so we do appreciate everything that
 
01:53:52.069 --> 01:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
they're provided to date uh we hope
 
01:53:54.629 --> 01:53:54.639 align:start position:0%
going forward that we can continue to
 
01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
work on this audit and comply with the
 
01:53:59.149 --> 01:53:59.159 align:start position:0%
statute as we are required I would have
 
01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
if with Christopher bonds here uh just
 
01:54:03.629 --> 01:54:03.639 align:start position:0%
have him to come up to kind of go over
 
01:54:06.669 --> 01:54:06.679 align:start position:0%
um kind of just the details in the uh
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
the contract relative to property and
 
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
who owns it and I don't know if you
 
01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to comment good great thank you
 
01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:21.350 align:start position:0%
wanted to comment good great thank you
Mr

01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:25.149 align:start position:0%
 
Rond

01:54:25.149 --> 01:54:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:26.470 --> 01:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
I'm in trouble when I'm Christopher and
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
not Chris
 
01:54:31.470 --> 01:54:31.480 align:start position:0%
so uh Chris Bond associate attorney
 
01:54:34.430 --> 01:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
general uh so unlike the last time I was
 
01:54:35.709 --> 01:54:35.719 align:start position:0%
up here with the Secretary of State
 
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
think it's certainly not our position
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
that this isn't un
 
01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
auditable thing um and I certainly
 
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
understand a lot of The Angst and
 
01:54:46.510 --> 01:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
frustration about uh
 
01:54:48.990 --> 01:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
not getting materials that folks think
 
01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
are necessary to audit the program the I
 
01:54:53.629 --> 01:54:53.639 align:start position:0%
think part of the
 
01:54:54.870 --> 01:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
difficulty and I think it's been touched
 
01:54:56.589 --> 01:54:56.599 align:start position:0%
on by attorney Brown and by commissioner
 
01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
ad BL um is uh the way one 94f is
 
01:55:02.830 --> 01:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
structured that the scholarship
 
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
organization is a specific identified
 
01:55:07.709 --> 01:55:07.719 align:start position:0%
entity in the statute that has its own
 
01:55:10.069 --> 01:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
specific responsibility so it is a lot
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
different I know early parts of this
 
01:55:13.030 --> 01:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
discussion when I was listening people
 
01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
were talking about you know a vendor of
 
01:55:17.629 --> 01:55:17.639 align:start position:0%
the department it's lots of times
 
01:55:19.709 --> 01:55:19.719 align:start position:0%
agencies will have a function and to
 
01:55:21.149 --> 01:55:21.159 align:start position:0%
perform that function they will they
 
01:55:22.750 --> 01:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
will do an RFP and they will get an
 
01:55:25.550 --> 01:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
outside entity in this instance it was
 
01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
mandated that they do it that way and
 
01:55:29.109 --> 01:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
the statute has specific functions for
 
01:55:32.350 --> 01:55:32.360 align:start position:0%
that specific um uh vendor I mean they
 
01:55:34.990 --> 01:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
did do an RFP process and and pick the
 
01:55:36.550 --> 01:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
vendor that in that me with that
 
01:55:40.069 --> 01:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
mechanism but that is a uh statutorily
 
01:55:42.750 --> 01:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
defined entity that has statutory duties
 
01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
in and of itself separate from the
 
01:55:46.589 --> 01:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
department but the the uh the session
 
01:55:48.550 --> 01:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
law that created this audit is
 
01:55:51.270 --> 01:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
specifically auditing the department so
 
01:55:53.550 --> 01:55:53.560 align:start position:0%
um I think that is what's causing a lot
 
01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
of the the uh The Angst is that the
 
01:55:57.950 --> 01:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
Department's role in the administering
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
of this program is is actually quite
 
01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
limited and more limited than you might
 
01:56:03.229 --> 01:56:03.239 align:start position:0%
imagine so I know you've got a copy of
 
01:56:04.990 --> 01:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
194f and I'd encourage you to take a
 
01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
look at it and I think that might be
 
01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
creating some of the friction here but
 
01:56:11.229 --> 01:56:11.239 align:start position:0%
in terms of this uh this this uh
 
01:56:13.870 --> 01:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
contractual issue I think um leaving
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
aside for a moment the merits of whether
 
01:56:18.830 --> 01:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
or not the data we're talking about
 
01:56:21.189 --> 01:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
falls under 10.2 or not I think the
 
01:56:23.390 --> 01:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
issue that we ident ify at the AG's
 
01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:24.870 align:start position:0%
issue that we ident ify at the AG's
office

01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:56:28.030 --> 01:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
is the the scholarship organization has
 
01:56:30.069 --> 01:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
contractual privity with the agency not
 
01:56:33.229 --> 01:56:33.239 align:start position:0%
with the LBA so if the LBA Auditors have
 
01:56:34.750 --> 01:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
a different interpretation of the
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
statute than the uh department and they
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
think the Department's wrong that's a
 
01:56:41.830 --> 01:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
certainly a valid audit finding to do
 
01:56:46.669 --> 01:56:46.679 align:start position:0%
but the the the uh the thing that we uh
 
01:56:49.149 --> 01:56:49.159 align:start position:0%
find potentially problematic is for the
 
01:56:50.750 --> 01:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
Auditors to sort of stand in the shoes
 
01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
of the department and exercise rights
 
01:56:54.109 --> 01:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
the department has under their contract
 
01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:56.719 align:start position:0%
with a third party so that and that's
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
sort of where um when the department
 
01:57:01.310 --> 01:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
reached out to us early on and said
 
01:57:03.189 --> 01:57:03.199 align:start position:0%
they're you know they're asking us to
 
01:57:04.910 --> 01:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
collect to get data that we don't have
 
01:57:07.709 --> 01:57:07.719 align:start position:0%
that we don't think we have access to um
 
01:57:10.510 --> 01:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
you we we responded that yeah it would
 
01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
not be appropriate for you to it's not
 
01:57:15.870 --> 01:57:15.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the Auditors to be
 
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
exercising Authority that the agency has
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
but but it's certainly appropriate for
 
01:57:22.669 --> 01:57:22.679 align:start position:0%
the Auditors to identify
 
01:57:25.069 --> 01:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
that the agency is not exercising
 
01:57:26.589 --> 01:57:26.599 align:start position:0%
Authority that they think they have
 
01:57:28.229 --> 01:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
contractually if that was part of their
 
01:57:30.149 --> 01:57:30.159 align:start position:0%
oversight obligation so I don't I don't
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
know if I'm being clear but I I my my
 
01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
point is just that um it's this dispute
 
01:57:39.229 --> 01:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
about what the contract allows access to
 
01:57:41.830 --> 01:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
is certainly an auditable thing and the
 
01:57:43.350 --> 01:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
Auditors and the department may end up
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
disagreeing and that may well end up
 
01:57:48.069 --> 01:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
being what the uh audit ends up being
 
01:57:51.149 --> 01:57:51.159 align:start position:0%
fundamentally about but um where the LBA
 
01:57:53.189 --> 01:57:53.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't agree with the a agency they
 
01:57:54.910 --> 01:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to stand in the
 
01:57:58.589 --> 01:57:58.599 align:start position:0%
shoes of the agency and gain contractual
 
01:58:00.950 --> 01:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
privity with the third party in this
 
01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
case the scholarship organization
 
01:58:07.109 --> 01:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
so you know the more I look at 10.2 the
 
01:58:11.350 --> 01:58:11.360 align:start position:0%
more ungrammatical it is and there's a
 
01:58:14.270 --> 01:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
missing comma there is a missing comma
 
01:58:17.229 --> 01:58:17.239 align:start position:0%
after property yep right and I and I
 
01:58:20.189 --> 01:58:20.199 align:start position:0%
feel compelled to point out uh that this
 
01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
language is from the state's p 37 so
 
01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
this is essentially in every single
 
01:58:26.270 --> 01:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
contract that we have with every vendor
 
01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
so it's ungrammatical but if you imagine
 
01:58:31.950 --> 01:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
that comma placed where it should
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
be the all
 
01:58:38.950 --> 01:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
data is the property of the state
 
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
because it's been bought with State
 
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
funds whether the
 
01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:46.030 align:start position:0%
funds whether the
department

01:58:46.030 --> 01:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
exercises its authority to get that
 
01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
information I think is yeah I mean I
 
01:58:55.629 --> 01:58:55.639 align:start position:0%
think discussable yeah the difficulty
 
01:58:57.510 --> 01:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
for me is I don't know exactly what
 
01:58:59.390 --> 01:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
information has been requested but I I
 
01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
certainly I think I heard the
 
01:59:02.109 --> 01:59:02.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner say in response to Senator
 
01:59:03.950 --> 01:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
Lang's question that there is some data
 
01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization has that
 
01:59:07.790 --> 01:59:07.800 align:start position:0%
the commissioner understands does fall
 
01:59:09.629 --> 01:59:09.639 align:start position:0%
under this because any information that
 
01:59:10.990 --> 01:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
any data that the
 
01:59:13.709 --> 01:59:13.719 align:start position:0%
department gave it so any information
 
01:59:15.109 --> 01:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
that the scholarship organization
 
01:59:18.550 --> 01:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
received from the state um that would be
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
information that they could get back I
 
01:59:22.350 --> 01:59:22.360 align:start position:0%
think the push back is on certain data
 
01:59:24.189 --> 01:59:24.199 align:start position:0%
that's collected directly from
 
01:59:26.910 --> 01:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
recipients that is neither provided by
 
01:59:29.069 --> 01:59:29.079 align:start position:0%
the state nor purchased with funds
 
01:59:30.870 --> 01:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
provided under this agreement so I I
 
01:59:32.830 --> 01:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
think that's where the friction is but
 
01:59:34.830 --> 01:59:34.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not exactly familiar with the scope
 
01:59:36.750 --> 01:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
of the data that the obba is looking for
 
01:59:38.350 --> 01:59:38.360 align:start position:0%
but I'm just thinking more fundamentally
 
01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
and going back to sort of process if the
 
01:59:43.550 --> 01:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
LBA and the agency don't agree on what
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
that contractual provision says and and
 
01:59:48.270 --> 01:59:48.280 align:start position:0%
maybe the LBA thinks it's perfectly
 
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
clear it means this other thing that's a
 
01:59:51.990 --> 01:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
valid audit finding but it's not it's
 
01:59:53.990 --> 01:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's not a mechanism to compel the
 
01:59:56.069 --> 01:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
agency to take any specific action even
 
01:59:57.310 --> 01:59:57.320 align:start position:0%
if the even if it's action that
 
01:59:58.629 --> 01:59:58.639 align:start position:0%
theoretically the agency should be
 
02:00:00.629 --> 02:00:00.639 align:start position:0%
taking it's not the lb's purview to
 
02:00:03.790 --> 02:00:03.800 align:start position:0%
compel that action got it re
 
02:00:06.910 --> 02:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
Weber so that's a perfect lead into my
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
question which is if the LBA cannot
 
02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:11.830 align:start position:0%
question which is if the LBA cannot
compel

02:00:11.830 --> 02:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
compel
 
02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:13.790 align:start position:0%
compel
that

02:00:13.790 --> 02:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:17.669 --> 02:00:17.679 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming without knowing it is
 
02:00:17.679 --> 02:00:18.750 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming without knowing it is
our

02:00:18.750 --> 02:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:00:21.229 --> 02:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
duty to figure out how to compel that
 
02:00:23.589 --> 02:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
and my question you as an Assistant
 
02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
Attorney General is how if this
 
02:00:30.310 --> 02:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
committee desires that information and
 
02:00:33.470 --> 02:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
believes that and this is all
 
02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:35.470 align:start position:0%
believes that and this is all
hypothetical

02:00:35.470 --> 02:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
hypothetical
 
02:00:38.149 --> 02:00:38.159 align:start position:0%
if this committee believed that the
 
02:00:40.510 --> 02:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
department Ed of Education was incorrect
 
02:00:42.709 --> 02:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
in their
 
02:00:45.229 --> 02:00:45.239 align:start position:0%
interpretation what would the remedy be
 
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
how would we fix that problem well
 
02:00:49.350 --> 02:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and I'm
 
02:00:51.030 --> 02:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
certainly understand why you want to
 
02:00:52.790 --> 02:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
know that I'm not prepared to answer
 
02:00:54.310 --> 02:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
that today I haven't looked into your
 
02:00:55.870 --> 02:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
authorities to compel that kind of
 
02:00:57.629 --> 02:00:57.639 align:start position:0%
information I do think if there were a
 
02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
legitimate dispute um contractural
 
02:01:02.229 --> 02:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
dispute um was it you who mentioned the
 
02:01:04.149 --> 02:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
third party the third branch of
 
02:01:05.550 --> 02:01:05.560 align:start position:0%
government needing to step in at some
 
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
point I mean hopefully we don't get to
 
02:01:08.229 --> 02:01:08.239 align:start position:0%
that point but I mean that's a
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
possibility I mean generally that's
 
02:01:11.550 --> 02:01:11.560 align:start position:0%
Courts are there to resolve contract
 
02:01:13.270 --> 02:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
disputes but it would be an interesting
 
02:01:15.589 --> 02:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
frame here especially if the scholarship
 
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
organization and the agency had the same
 
02:01:20.310 --> 02:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
interpretation and it was a essentially
 
02:01:21.629 --> 02:01:21.639 align:start position:0%
a third party with a different
 
02:01:21.639 --> 02:01:22.750 align:start position:0%
a third party with a different
understanding

02:01:22.750 --> 02:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
um but uh and also because this is part
 
02:01:28.709 --> 02:01:28.719 align:start position:0%
of our standard um language that is in
 
02:01:30.430 --> 02:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
basically all state contracts and less
 
02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:32.229 align:start position:0%
basically all state contracts and less
modified

02:01:32.229 --> 02:01:32.239 align:start position:0%
modified
 
02:01:34.709 --> 02:01:34.719 align:start position:0%
um there may be some case law on this
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
too there may be um but again it would
 
02:01:38.109 --> 02:01:38.119 align:start position:0%
depend on the specific data which I'm
 
02:01:40.229 --> 02:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
not I have not looked at what what the
 
02:01:43.870 --> 02:01:43.880 align:start position:0%
specific um requests are for information
 
02:01:46.510 --> 02:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
to know but I do know that we have in
 
02:01:49.510 --> 02:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
the past interpreted this as um being
 
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
limited to data provided by the a agency
 
02:01:55.390 --> 02:01:55.400 align:start position:0%
or purchased with funds and uh and
 
02:01:57.310 --> 02:01:57.320 align:start position:0%
vendors push back on that a lot ask for
 
02:01:59.229 --> 02:01:59.239 align:start position:0%
clarification a lot because they're very
 
02:02:01.510 --> 02:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
concerned they often bring expertise and
 
02:02:03.510 --> 02:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge and intellectual property to
 
02:02:05.069 --> 02:02:05.079 align:start position:0%
the table and they want to make sure
 
02:02:06.709 --> 02:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
that this isn't read so broadly that it
 
02:02:10.069 --> 02:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
Scoops all that stuff up so thank
 
02:02:13.870 --> 02:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
you yes L again the way I read it is
 
02:02:16.709 --> 02:02:16.719 align:start position:0%
it's a state if if they use State funds
 
02:02:19.990 --> 02:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
to buy a study the study trending in you
 
02:02:22.149 --> 02:02:22.159 align:start position:0%
know early childhood education missed
 
02:02:23.910 --> 02:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
the first part of that so if if if the
 
02:02:25.870 --> 02:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
scholarship Association had used State
 
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
funds to buy a study about education in
 
02:02:31.950 --> 02:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
some form that would be discoverable and
 
02:02:34.109 --> 02:02:34.119 align:start position:0%
available for this purpose right yes
 
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
because that's direct but a child
 
02:02:39.790 --> 02:02:39.800 align:start position:0%
applying for the program wouldn't be
 
02:02:41.990 --> 02:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
funds wouldn't be funded wouldn't be
 
02:02:43.510 --> 02:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
something that was bought by the by
 
02:02:45.189 --> 02:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
State dollars right and it wouldn't be
 
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
data or property received from the state
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
I so that would be outside the scope of
 
02:02:51.990 --> 02:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
the contract yeah but but again even if
 
02:02:54.550 --> 02:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
even if it were say there was this study
 
02:02:56.189 --> 02:02:56.199 align:start position:0%
uh this hypothetical study that the
 
02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization paid for I
 
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
agree in that scenario the department
 
02:03:02.950 --> 02:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
would be able to get that information
 
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
from the scholarship organization but if
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
the department told the LBA Auditors we
 
02:03:08.229 --> 02:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
can't get that information I still don't
 
02:03:09.629 --> 02:03:09.639 align:start position:0%
think it would be correct for the
 
02:03:11.589 --> 02:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
Auditors to reach out to the scholarship
 
02:03:12.910 --> 02:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
organization to get it I think that
 
02:03:14.350 --> 02:03:14.360 align:start position:0%
would be the basis of an audit finding
 
02:03:16.149 --> 02:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
saying the department is not doing their
 
02:03:17.709 --> 02:03:17.719 align:start position:0%
job here they have this clear
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
contractual right to get this
 
02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
information that they should be getting
 
02:03:21.910 --> 02:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
to oversee the program and they're not
 
02:03:24.109 --> 02:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
doing it that's the way I Envision that
 
02:03:26.709 --> 02:03:26.719 align:start position:0%
playing out right but the demographic
 
02:03:28.350 --> 02:03:28.360 align:start position:0%
data that we talked about right a child
 
02:03:30.589 --> 02:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
applying for is not purchase data it's
 
02:03:32.149 --> 02:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
not so therefore it's outside the scope
 
02:03:33.910 --> 02:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
of the definition of data and from the
 
02:03:37.950 --> 02:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
state thank you representative Weber oh
 
02:03:41.870 --> 02:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:45.669 --> 02:03:45.679 align:start position:0%
first I'm just again
 
02:03:48.030 --> 02:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
bewildered by the assertion that the
 
02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
state has not purchased this property
 
02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
because the state's funding the entire
 
02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:54.069 align:start position:0%
because the state's funding the entire
program

02:03:54.069 --> 02:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:56.549 --> 02:03:56.559 align:start position:0%
so all funding for everything is coming
 
02:03:57.629 --> 02:03:57.639 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
state um but again that is something
 
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
that I assume that the LBA is going to
 
02:04:09.189 --> 02:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
discuss in their findings and and can go
 
02:04:12.030 --> 02:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
on from there I just want to make make
 
02:04:14.109 --> 02:04:14.119 align:start position:0%
it known that you know it's not like
 
02:04:16.109 --> 02:04:16.119 align:start position:0%
this is an organization of the kind you
 
02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
were discussing where they bring
 
02:04:21.310 --> 02:04:21.320 align:start position:0%
intellectual property or a a specific
 
02:04:23.589 --> 02:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
type of of uh data management or
 
02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
anything else to the table this is all
 
02:04:30.069 --> 02:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
data that is purchased with State
 
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
funds because it's the state that's
 
02:04:35.549 --> 02:04:35.559 align:start position:0%
funding the entire
 
02:04:38.910 --> 02:04:38.920 align:start position:0%
program so we're going to go Senator
 
02:04:40.990 --> 02:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
Lang then we're going to go
 
02:04:43.669 --> 02:04:43.679 align:start position:0%
representative Earth and then we're
 
02:04:47.470 --> 02:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
going to go Pearl and Whitley
 
02:04:49.990 --> 02:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
right I have the same interpretation as
 
02:04:54.069 --> 02:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:56.030 --> 02:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
hope we
 
02:04:58.470 --> 02:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
do might I make my motion
 
02:05:02.470 --> 02:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
now um no more more questions more hands
 
02:05:07.109 --> 02:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
up Senator Pearl thank you so I guess my
 
02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
question is and I'm trying to understand
 
02:05:13.510 --> 02:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
State money portion is the fulfilling a
 
02:05:16.109 --> 02:05:16.119 align:start position:0%
or awarding a grant considered
 
02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
purchasing information with State money
 
02:05:20.910 --> 02:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
or purchasing something with State money
 
02:05:22.549 --> 02:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
I mean that that wouldn't be my
 
02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
understanding I mean if if we took that
 
02:05:26.669 --> 02:05:26.679 align:start position:0%
interpretation that anytime there was a
 
02:05:32.669 --> 02:05:32.679 align:start position:0%
grant anything an agen an eny did would
 
02:05:35.270 --> 02:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
would uh it would it would pull a lot of
 
02:05:36.549 --> 02:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
things in that I don't think that the
 
02:05:38.950 --> 02:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
word purchase implies if we were to do
 
02:05:40.990 --> 02:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
it that broadly follow well that that's
 
02:05:42.470 --> 02:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
kind of what I'm thinking
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm trying to draw the line
 
02:05:46.629 --> 02:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
as to what we're purchasing with State
 
02:05:48.750 --> 02:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
money and where we're awarding a grant I
 
02:05:50.790 --> 02:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
guess that's kind of where I'm trying to
 
02:05:52.549 --> 02:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
because the
 
02:05:54.790 --> 02:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom counts are are a
 
02:05:57.510 --> 02:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
grant that we provide these students so
 
02:05:59.350 --> 02:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
what what does the state entitled to own
 
02:06:01.990 --> 02:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
of that information for that
 
02:06:04.430 --> 02:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
student under under this contract or
 
02:06:07.030 --> 02:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
under the program I I guess either or
 
02:06:08.830 --> 02:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get a handle on exactly so
 
02:06:10.350 --> 02:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
I do think I mean I do think there's a
 
02:06:11.629 --> 02:06:11.639 align:start position:0%
distinction here I mean we're focused
 
02:06:14.350 --> 02:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
here on a a particular section of the
 
02:06:16.830 --> 02:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
p37 and what it means so we're talking
 
02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
about the rights contractual rights
 
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
between an agency and a third party that
 
02:06:23.549 --> 02:06:23.559 align:start position:0%
they've contracted with here but then
 
02:06:25.350 --> 02:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
there's also the program so that as I
 
02:06:27.510 --> 02:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
said the uh RSA
 
02:06:30.069 --> 02:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
194f ascribes specific statutory
 
02:06:31.229 --> 02:06:31.239 align:start position:0%
functions to the scholarship
 
02:06:33.030 --> 02:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
organization so there certainly may be a
 
02:06:36.669 --> 02:06:36.679 align:start position:0%
vehicle there for this body to get at
 
02:06:38.790 --> 02:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
that information but not through a
 
02:06:41.589 --> 02:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
chapter law that's advising or that that
 
02:06:43.830 --> 02:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
is uh asking for an audit of the
 
02:06:45.990 --> 02:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education where the only
 
02:06:48.189 --> 02:06:48.199 align:start position:0%
mechanism is this is this contractual
 
02:06:51.629 --> 02:06:51.639 align:start position:0%
provision um so I I it's not it's not
 
02:06:54.390 --> 02:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
not as if 10.2 means the state could
 
02:06:56.549 --> 02:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
never look at this there may be a way
 
02:06:58.189 --> 02:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
and I agnostic on that because I haven't
 
02:06:59.709 --> 02:06:59.719 align:start position:0%
looked into it but looking at the
 
02:07:01.790 --> 02:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
structure of 194 there may be other
 
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
avenues here including a direct audit of
 
02:07:06.470 --> 02:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization potentially
 
02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
um but this isn't that and so but I
 
02:07:12.109 --> 02:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
think with here um you know the fact
 
02:07:13.390 --> 02:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
that they're administering the program I
 
02:07:15.669 --> 02:07:15.679 align:start position:0%
mean the the information that I
 
02:07:17.069 --> 02:07:17.079 align:start position:0%
understand to be at issue but I'm not
 
02:07:18.549 --> 02:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
100% sure because I haven't seen the
 
02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
actual data requests uh or info or
 
02:07:25.149 --> 02:07:25.159 align:start position:0%
document requests but the
 
02:07:27.709 --> 02:07:27.719 align:start position:0%
information that is subject would be
 
02:07:30.229 --> 02:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
information that is provided by
 
02:07:31.510 --> 02:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
individuals to the scholarship
 
02:07:34.069 --> 02:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
organization not not paid for by the
 
02:07:35.830 --> 02:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization which is what a
 
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
purchase would imply so if I may just
 
02:07:40.709 --> 02:07:40.719 align:start position:0%
kind of finish the train of thought here
 
02:07:43.030 --> 02:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
so essentially if I'm understanding you
 
02:07:45.350 --> 02:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
then that the information that the
 
02:07:47.990 --> 02:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
Scholarship Foundation or schol
 
02:07:50.669 --> 02:07:50.679 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund has on
 
02:07:52.470 --> 02:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
individual app applicants because
 
02:07:54.069 --> 02:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
they're receiving a grant would not
 
02:07:56.229 --> 02:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily be subject to considered
 
02:08:00.750 --> 02:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
property of the state not not under 10.2
 
02:08:03.069 --> 02:08:03.079 align:start position:0%
purchase language but possibly
 
02:08:05.470 --> 02:08:05.480 align:start position:0%
statutorily in a different mechanism
 
02:08:06.870 --> 02:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
possibly yeah thank you just trying to
 
02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
make sure I got my head Senator Whitley
 
02:08:12.750 --> 02:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I I just want to
 
02:08:15.510 --> 02:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
reorient to the committee and also you
 
02:08:17.350 --> 02:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
know to you that we're talking about $24
 
02:08:20.709 --> 02:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
million of taxpayer dollars that's
 
02:08:23.790 --> 02:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
potentially going to be even more if the
 
02:08:25.629 --> 02:08:25.639 align:start position:0%
governor signs a bill increasing the
 
02:08:28.470 --> 02:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
income eligibility that is a lot of
 
02:08:30.830 --> 02:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
money and a very resource scarce State
 
02:08:33.750 --> 02:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
and so this interpretation is troubling
 
02:08:35.510 --> 02:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
as you can understand because we do have
 
02:08:38.109 --> 02:08:38.119 align:start position:0%
an obligation to make sure that taxpayer
 
02:08:40.589 --> 02:08:40.599 align:start position:0%
dollars are being spent appropriately
 
02:08:43.069 --> 02:08:43.079 align:start position:0%
and so what I'm hearing from the LBA and
 
02:08:45.470 --> 02:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
also from your interpretation is that
 
02:08:47.350 --> 02:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
we're not able to determine whether
 
02:08:48.629 --> 02:08:48.639 align:start position:0%
these dollars are being spent
 
02:08:51.470 --> 02:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
appropriately whether $24 million ofx
 
02:08:53.669 --> 02:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars is being spent
 
02:08:55.910 --> 02:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
appropriately we're not able to do that
 
02:08:57.229 --> 02:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm
 
02:09:01.669 --> 02:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
hearing not through the mechanism of a
 
02:09:03.589 --> 02:09:03.599 align:start position:0%
performance audit of the Department of
 
02:09:06.149 --> 02:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
education's administering of the program
 
02:09:08.549 --> 02:09:08.559 align:start position:0%
but possibly through another
 
02:09:10.910 --> 02:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
mechanism thank
 
02:09:13.189 --> 02:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
you I just would point so be clear the
 
02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
answer yes we can but this is wrong the
 
02:09:19.350 --> 02:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:21.950 --> 02:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
proper I
 
02:09:24.149 --> 02:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
yes maybe I haven't looked into it but I
 
02:09:26.629 --> 02:09:26.639 align:start position:0%
expect yes maybe the answer is always it
 
02:09:30.069 --> 02:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
depends but yes my not not through this
 
02:09:34.510 --> 02:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
mechanism right so the $24 million is
 
02:09:39.109 --> 02:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
this year yep last year was 18 and the
 
02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
first year was I don't know eight or
 
02:09:45.069 --> 02:09:45.079 align:start position:0%
nine again my my point to maybe this
 
02:09:47.430 --> 02:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
answer Senator Lang it's not the doj is
 
02:09:52.750 --> 02:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
saying we can't figure out if
 
02:09:54.750 --> 02:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
These funds are
 
02:09:58.870 --> 02:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
being spent as the legislature intended
 
02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
them I don't think the program is UN
 
02:10:03.229 --> 02:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
auditable I don't but we don't think
 
02:10:06.350 --> 02:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
this chapter law gets to the scholarship
 
02:10:08.990 --> 02:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
organization through the vehicle of this
 
02:10:11.750 --> 02:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
um vendor contract thank you thank you
 
02:10:13.870 --> 02:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
all right thanks okay I don't think we
 
02:10:17.270 --> 02:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
need a motion though because it's a
 
02:10:20.669 --> 02:10:20.679 align:start position:0%
statutory audited and the statutorily
 
02:10:23.629 --> 02:10:23.639 align:start position:0%
required so is it clear this point that
 
02:10:25.390 --> 02:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
clear to you at this point that the Ed
 
02:10:28.709 --> 02:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
Department of education's perspective is
 
02:10:31.149 --> 02:10:31.159 align:start position:0%
the one that will be followed and that
 
02:10:33.549 --> 02:10:33.559 align:start position:0%
there'll be no need to press out to the
 
02:10:36.910 --> 02:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund I I think
 
02:10:39.870 --> 02:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
it's clear that the
 
02:10:43.990 --> 02:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
legislation requires an audit of the
 
02:10:47.589 --> 02:10:47.599 align:start position:0%
department not of the
 
02:10:50.669 --> 02:10:50.679 align:start position:0%
contractor that part's clear to me okay
 
02:10:52.109 --> 02:10:52.119 align:start position:0%
I mean I agree with that if that's where
 
02:10:53.430 --> 02:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
we are
 
02:10:56.790 --> 02:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
y i I just I don't think there's any so
 
02:10:58.950 --> 02:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
again I think and and to Mike's point I
 
02:11:00.350 --> 02:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
was going to speak to next is that at
 
02:11:01.589 --> 02:11:01.599 align:start position:0%
this point we're still developing a
 
02:11:03.510 --> 02:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
scope that has to come back to us by the
 
02:11:06.030 --> 02:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
number two understanding what that scope
 
02:11:07.510 --> 02:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
is now with the understanding of all the
 
02:11:08.830 --> 02:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
conversation we just have with the AG
 
02:11:10.669 --> 02:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
and a everything else so we're still
 
02:11:12.270 --> 02:11:12.280 align:start position:0%
going to hear about this again when they
 
02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
bring It Forward um for a vote so we
 
02:11:17.430 --> 02:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
still got to get a scope of work within
 
02:11:20.109 --> 02:11:20.119 align:start position:0%
the confines that we just discussed
 
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely and I just want to thank uh
 
02:11:25.549 --> 02:11:25.559 align:start position:0%
Chris Bond uh for that clarification Mr
 
02:11:29.069 --> 02:11:29.079 align:start position:0%
Bond Mr Bond Chris Bond
 
02:11:33.549 --> 02:11:33.559 align:start position:0%
uh so um if it's very early on if
 
02:11:35.109 --> 02:11:35.119 align:start position:0%
there's a disagreement this is not an
 
02:11:37.229 --> 02:11:37.239 align:start position:0%
audit finding by any means we're not
 
02:11:38.750 --> 02:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
even in there with the scope or anything
 
02:11:40.629 --> 02:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
we have conversations with agencies that
 
02:11:42.549 --> 02:11:42.559 align:start position:0%
we may disagree at first but then
 
02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
hearing from an attorney uh we we may
 
02:11:47.149 --> 02:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
change our mind and it's very clear we
 
02:11:49.549 --> 02:11:49.559 align:start position:0%
like to get that so it's very very early
 
02:11:51.390 --> 02:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
we're not I just wanted to clarify we're
 
02:11:53.350 --> 02:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
not putting an observation out today
 
02:11:54.910 --> 02:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
we're not even in there we're just
 
02:11:56.510 --> 02:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
gathering information we're learning
 
02:11:58.830 --> 02:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
ourselves um and so I just I appreciate
 
02:12:00.830 --> 02:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
this conversation for my behalf and our
 
02:12:02.589 --> 02:12:02.599 align:start position:0%
Auditor's behalf to just understand
 
02:12:04.589 --> 02:12:04.599 align:start position:0%
everything that goes into this so thank
 
02:12:07.270 --> 02:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
you but we have just discussed it for an
 
02:12:09.470 --> 02:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
hour and a the next step is that they'll
 
02:12:11.830 --> 02:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
bring it on some they'll bring some time
 
02:12:14.510 --> 02:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
forward and we'll be talking about it
 
02:12:16.950 --> 02:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
again looking forward to
 
02:12:21.669 --> 02:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
it wait okay but we're not done no
 
02:12:27.470 --> 02:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
so more there's more suspended tabled
 
02:12:29.709 --> 02:12:29.719 align:start position:0%
and potential audit
 
02:12:32.910 --> 02:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
topics and i' note that I think you all
 
02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
got an email from representative
 
02:12:42.069 --> 02:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:49.910 --> 02:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:58.950 --> 02:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:00.709 align:start position:0%
 
because

02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:13:00.719 --> 02:13:03.629 align:start position:0%
because

02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
up no same subject Environmental
 
02:13:24.750 --> 02:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:27.270 --> 02:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
soltion aren't you glad you're not on
 
02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:28.790 align:start position:0%
soltion aren't you glad you're not on
this

02:13:28.790 --> 02:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:13:31.990 --> 02:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
committee actually I'm sad that I'm not
 
02:13:36.069 --> 02:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
on this committee um um Madam chair you
 
02:13:39.229 --> 02:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
can take the girl out of Finance but you
 
02:13:42.950 --> 02:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
can't take Finance out of the girl and I
 
02:13:47.950 --> 02:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
love this committee and it is I believe
 
02:13:50.549 --> 02:13:50.559 align:start position:0%
one of the most important committees
 
02:13:52.430 --> 02:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
that we have have in the legislature
 
02:13:55.310 --> 02:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
although it is unknown to many
 
02:13:59.229 --> 02:13:59.239 align:start position:0%
people um several almost two years ago
 
02:14:02.750 --> 02:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
now the Judiciary Committee asked you to
 
02:14:07.390 --> 02:14:07.400 align:start position:0%
consider um uh a per a performance order
 
02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
for the human relations uh commission
 
02:14:13.750 --> 02:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
and we're waiting patiently for the
 
02:14:19.149 --> 02:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
results um this time um we came we're
 
02:14:22.189 --> 02:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
coming to you because because we had a
 
02:14:26.350 --> 02:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
bill that came to us um and the prime
 
02:14:28.589 --> 02:14:28.599 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill had to
 
02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
leave understandably not expecting to
 
02:14:34.750 --> 02:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
take the whole day here um it concerns
 
02:14:38.229 --> 02:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
the department of um invironmental
 
02:14:42.709 --> 02:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
Services each of the Departments we know
 
02:14:44.430 --> 02:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
as the way we have the government
 
02:14:47.470 --> 02:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
structured are are large they're very
 
02:14:50.589 --> 02:14:50.599 align:start position:0%
complex they have lots of subdivisions
 
02:14:52.629 --> 02:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
lots of barriers of
 
02:14:55.390 --> 02:14:55.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility and um it makes it very
 
02:14:57.990 --> 02:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
complicated to run those
 
02:15:00.470 --> 02:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
departments uh the Department of
 
02:15:03.629 --> 02:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services has
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
four different units that handle
 
02:15:12.510 --> 02:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
hearings and appeals and the rules of
 
02:15:16.549 --> 02:15:16.559 align:start position:0%
each one of those units differs one from
 
02:15:16.559 --> 02:15:17.270 align:start position:0%
each one of those units differs one from
the

02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
other uh and uh which makes it a very
 
02:15:27.910 --> 02:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
very complex problem to be able um to
 
02:15:31.709 --> 02:15:31.719 align:start position:0%
administer um representative MC willians
 
02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
came to us um because of a concern about
 
02:15:39.709 --> 02:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
what was happening with uh
 
02:15:42.790 --> 02:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
um situations relating to housing we
 
02:15:45.149 --> 02:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
know how important housing is we don't
 
02:15:46.430 --> 02:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
have enough
 
02:15:50.430 --> 02:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
housing um and she had a number of
 
02:15:53.750 --> 02:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
concerns S one of them was that in at
 
02:15:58.510 --> 02:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
least one of those four separate
 
02:16:02.189 --> 02:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
lines um there would could be a an a a
 
02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
complaint filed a decision reached and
 
02:16:09.229 --> 02:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
then if you want to appeal the decision
 
02:16:11.589 --> 02:16:11.599 align:start position:0%
you have to go to the very same people
 
02:16:12.750 --> 02:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
who made the
 
02:16:16.030 --> 02:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
decision and that seemed to be a
 
02:16:19.310 --> 02:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
little strange it didn't make sense and
 
02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
as we've looked further into the
 
02:16:26.830 --> 02:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
legislation um we realized that how the
 
02:16:29.910 --> 02:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
department was trying to coordinate each
 
02:16:33.990 --> 02:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
of these disperate oh dear did I offend
 
02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:34.750 align:start position:0%
of these disperate oh dear did I offend
the

02:16:34.750 --> 02:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:36.950 align:start position:0%
the
chair

02:16:36.950 --> 02:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:16:42.830 --> 02:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
oh oh okay um sorry uh was was made no
 
02:16:45.669 --> 02:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
sense if it's okay with you madam chair
 
02:16:49.589 --> 02:16:49.599 align:start position:0%
I would like to ask one of my colleagues
 
02:16:51.589 --> 02:16:51.599 align:start position:0%
representative man
 
02:16:53.190 --> 02:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
who worked very closely on the
 
02:16:56.469 --> 02:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill to come and join me and
 
02:17:00.509 --> 02:17:00.519 align:start position:0%
talk about why we think the
 
02:17:02.910 --> 02:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
existing procedure doesn't make any
 
02:17:06.629 --> 02:17:06.639 align:start position:0%
sense the bill would have put in place
 
02:17:09.709 --> 02:17:09.719 align:start position:0%
yet an entirely different level that
 
02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
would have um created the opportunity
 
02:17:15.990 --> 02:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
for a denovo hearing you know beginning
 
02:17:18.910 --> 02:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
at the beginning again none of that made
 
02:17:21.669 --> 02:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
sense and we concluded
 
02:17:24.950 --> 02:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
that the department might benefit from
 
02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:25.950 align:start position:0%
that the department might benefit from
some

02:17:25.950 --> 02:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:17:28.589 --> 02:17:28.599 align:start position:0%
help that would come from a performance
 
02:17:30.830 --> 02:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
audit so that they could better do what
 
02:17:34.270 --> 02:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
we asked them to do and is
 
02:17:36.389 --> 02:17:36.399 align:start position:0%
representative representative Manos is
 
02:17:39.110 --> 02:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
right here and so is representative MC
 
02:17:42.990 --> 02:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
Williams oh oh I'm sorry I I saw you
 
02:17:44.469 --> 02:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
leave but I didn't see you come back yes
 
02:17:46.070 --> 02:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
so if I could ask the two of them to
 
02:17:48.309 --> 02:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
come up would would that be acceptable
 
02:17:50.230 --> 02:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
it would be if the committee is willing
 
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
to stay thank you very
 
02:17:56.629 --> 02:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
much it seems like the house you're
 
02:17:57.990 --> 02:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to have left
 
02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:01.070 align:start position:0%
supposed to have left
[Music]

02:18:01.070 --> 02:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:18:06.030 --> 02:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
apparently Finance Finance at just our
 
02:18:09.429 --> 02:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
turn okay you know what is we waited our
 
02:18:11.950 --> 02:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
turn thank you
 
02:18:14.790 --> 02:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you uh I'm representative
 
02:18:18.950 --> 02:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
Manos from stratum um uh representative
 
02:18:21.709 --> 02:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
MC Williams did draft this bill um and
 
02:18:24.190 --> 02:18:24.200 align:start position:0%
sponsored it it was heard by the
 
02:18:26.709 --> 02:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee uh I think one of
 
02:18:29.190 --> 02:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
the major points is that there are four
 
02:18:31.750 --> 02:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
separate councils to which you can
 
02:18:35.790 --> 02:18:35.800 align:start position:0%
appeal a Dees decision they're the air
 
02:18:38.950 --> 02:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
Resources Council the wetlands Council
 
02:18:40.709 --> 02:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
the water Council and the waste
 
02:18:43.669 --> 02:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
management Council and they hear uh
 
02:18:46.429 --> 02:18:46.439 align:start position:0%
appeals and they review administrative
 
02:18:49.070 --> 02:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
rules during the testimony on the bill
 
02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
we heard from the supervisor I believe
 
02:18:55.469 --> 02:18:55.479 align:start position:0%
it was of one of the councils I believe
 
02:18:58.349 --> 02:18:58.359 align:start position:0%
it was Wetland Wetlands Council and we
 
02:19:00.830 --> 02:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
learned during the course of the hearing
 
02:19:02.990 --> 02:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
that they each of these councils has
 
02:19:05.349 --> 02:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
different standards for their appeals
 
02:19:07.990 --> 02:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
they have different rules and so you can
 
02:19:10.910 --> 02:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
get an inconsistent outcome on an issue
 
02:19:13.070 --> 02:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
depending on which Council you're in
 
02:19:16.830 --> 02:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
front of um in addition to that once
 
02:19:20.469 --> 02:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
there's a hearing your appeal right is
 
02:19:24.389 --> 02:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
to to the Supreme Court and there's no
 
02:19:26.990 --> 02:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
process part of the problem is
 
02:19:30.190 --> 02:19:30.200 align:start position:0%
introducing new scientific evidence and
 
02:19:34.270 --> 02:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
so there's um no opportunity for that to
 
02:19:37.230 --> 02:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
occur but I think the main point here is
 
02:19:39.309 --> 02:19:39.319 align:start position:0%
that you can have different outcomes
 
02:19:41.669 --> 02:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
depending on the topic and the subject
 
02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
matter and so um we are seeking the
 
02:19:47.589 --> 02:19:47.599 align:start position:0%
performance audit to look at those
 
02:19:51.070 --> 02:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
systemic issues um and how this can be
 
02:19:53.830 --> 02:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
better handled the outcome on the
 
02:19:55.830 --> 02:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
committee was a recommendation for
 
02:19:58.950 --> 02:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
interim study and so we the committee as
 
02:20:01.349 --> 02:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
a whole will it hasn't gone to the floor
 
02:20:03.309 --> 02:20:03.319 align:start position:0%
yet but that may be the potential
 
02:20:06.030 --> 02:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
outcome on the floor um but we're
 
02:20:08.950 --> 02:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
interested in getting the review of the
 
02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:10.110 align:start position:0%
interested in getting the review of the
broader

02:20:10.110 --> 02:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
broader
 
02:20:13.750 --> 02:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
issues so I guess I have a question for
 
02:20:13.760 --> 02:20:15.670 align:start position:0%
issues so I guess I have a question for
representative

02:20:15.670 --> 02:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:20:20.230 --> 02:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
Smith Bob Lynn's letter says all the
 
02:20:24.389 --> 02:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
division s of Dees but the discussion
 
02:20:26.429 --> 02:20:26.439 align:start position:0%
has been about the
 
02:20:31.349 --> 02:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
four hearings and Appeals Council
 
02:20:34.349 --> 02:20:34.359 align:start position:0%
so are you looking
 
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
for a performance audit on these four
 
02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
different councils or
 
02:20:44.670 --> 02:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
on all of the divisions with Dees which
 
02:20:47.469 --> 02:20:47.479 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing are more than
 
02:20:49.630 --> 02:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
four if I
 
02:20:53.150 --> 02:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
could the problem that came to
 
02:20:57.150 --> 02:20:57.160 align:start position:0%
us seemed to indicate that each that
 
02:21:00.309 --> 02:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
what we thought at first was one area
 
02:21:03.990 --> 02:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
was quickly multiplied really by
 
02:21:07.150 --> 02:21:07.160 align:start position:0%
Department itself saying bringing to our
 
02:21:10.790 --> 02:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
attention that it wasn't just one it was
 
02:21:15.429 --> 02:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
all that I know because of my the high
 
02:21:17.710 --> 02:21:17.720 align:start position:0%
regard which I hold
 
02:21:24.510 --> 02:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
LBA that if you were to agree to let
 
02:21:28.349 --> 02:21:28.359 align:start position:0%
them you know begin to look at this they
 
02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
would and I know from P experience and
 
02:21:33.790 --> 02:21:33.800 align:start position:0%
you know that they would say the best
 
02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
way to do this would be to look at one
 
02:21:43.270 --> 02:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
or look at across the board or however
 
02:21:46.990 --> 02:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
and what our concern was to help the
 
02:21:50.630 --> 02:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
department do the best possible job in
 
02:21:54.190 --> 02:21:54.200 align:start position:0%
their hearing and appeal process and I
 
02:21:57.230 --> 02:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
would leave it although I noticed that
 
02:21:59.469 --> 02:21:59.479 align:start position:0%
the head of LBA isn't looking at me he's
 
02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
that but we were hoping that you know
 
02:22:09.429 --> 02:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
that from their perspective they could
 
02:22:13.070 --> 02:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
say this is how to narrow this looks so
 
02:22:19.510 --> 02:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:21.070 align:start position:0%
 
represent

02:22:21.070 --> 02:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:22:22.590 --> 02:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question and thank
 
02:22:24.910 --> 02:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
you for the commentary uh I think that
 
02:22:26.830 --> 02:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
we want to keep it broad for now and
 
02:22:28.429 --> 02:22:28.439 align:start position:0%
possibly narrowed during the
 
02:22:30.550 --> 02:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
investigation um I think that there's a
 
02:22:32.230 --> 02:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
lot that could come out just from the
 
02:22:34.910 --> 02:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
initial conversation uh with the inner
 
02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
workings of how this is managed across
 
02:22:39.070 --> 02:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
the four different departments and and
 
02:22:41.270 --> 02:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
certainly inconsistency is not the goal
 
02:22:43.429 --> 02:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
I think fairness is the goal and of
 
02:22:45.349 --> 02:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
course Justice having brought this to
 
02:22:47.469 --> 02:22:47.479 align:start position:0%
Judiciary is also the
 
02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
goal thank you uh representative
 
02:22:52.990 --> 02:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
could you just give me the name of the
 
02:22:55.230 --> 02:22:55.240 align:start position:0%
four councils again please oh sure air
 
02:22:59.070 --> 02:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
resources Wetlands water and waste very
 
02:23:01.349 --> 02:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
slowly because I am old and have
 
02:23:04.590 --> 02:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
arthritic fingers my apologies represent
 
02:23:08.070 --> 02:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
I've got air air water the whole name
 
02:23:12.070 --> 02:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:13.710 align:start position:0%
 
Council

02:23:13.710 --> 02:23:13.720 align:start position:0%
Council
 
02:23:18.030 --> 02:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:22.389 --> 02:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
Council yep Wetlands Council
 
02:23:25.230 --> 02:23:25.240 align:start position:0%
yep Waste Management Council thank you
 
02:23:27.070 --> 02:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
very much
 
02:23:30.150 --> 02:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
councils okay thank you
 
02:23:32.309 --> 02:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
sure uh what do the committee you want
 
02:23:32.319 --> 02:23:34.190 align:start position:0%
sure uh what do the committee you want
to

02:23:34.190 --> 02:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:23:34.200 --> 02:23:36.190 align:start position:0%
to
do

02:23:36.190 --> 02:23:36.200 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:23:38.469 --> 02:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
Senator I think it might be best to take
 
02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
this up at our next meeting when we have
 
02:23:42.389 --> 02:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
our full compliment again so that we can
 
02:23:43.790 --> 02:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
have all of the members be able to weigh
 
02:23:47.110 --> 02:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
in okay and I was going to ask following
 
02:23:53.070 --> 02:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
up on that that um I understand the
 
02:23:57.990 --> 02:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
initial desire for a broad look but um
 
02:23:59.910 --> 02:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
broad looks take many times many
 
02:24:02.830 --> 02:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
Auditors and are very expensive
 
02:24:06.269 --> 02:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
so anything that members of the
 
02:24:08.750 --> 02:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee could do between now
 
02:24:12.870 --> 02:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
and our next meeting to help us really
 
02:24:12.880 --> 02:24:14.469 align:start position:0%
and our next meeting to help us really
closely

02:24:14.469 --> 02:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
closely
 
02:24:17.590 --> 02:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
articulate what it is we're looking at
 
02:24:20.510 --> 02:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
because um I I understand that the
 
02:24:22.590 --> 02:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
overall Drive is fundamental fairness
 
02:24:25.230 --> 02:24:25.240 align:start position:0%
and the conflicts between the the four
 
02:24:28.349 --> 02:24:28.359 align:start position:0%
councils uh but not knowing how they're
 
02:24:30.469 --> 02:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
interwork myself very well it would be
 
02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
really helpful if you can do anything to
 
02:24:36.990 --> 02:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
pinpoint more clearly the areas that we
 
02:24:40.070 --> 02:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
need to look at so that we can start
 
02:24:42.910 --> 02:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
with um a
 
02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
beginning directive that will then
 
02:24:47.990 --> 02:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
evolve into a scope statement going
 
02:24:51.630 --> 02:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
forward so um thank you if I could add
 
02:24:53.870 --> 02:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
just one thing the initial
 
02:24:57.230 --> 02:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
concern was that's okay the initial
 
02:25:00.710 --> 02:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
concern uh had to do with
 
02:25:05.469 --> 02:25:05.479 align:start position:0%
housing um and it was from that area
 
02:25:08.429 --> 02:25:08.439 align:start position:0%
that we then realized the problem was
 
02:25:11.990 --> 02:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
much greater so the question is do you
 
02:25:15.230 --> 02:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
look at the greater issue or do you look
 
02:25:17.950 --> 02:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
at you know do you look at the whole
 
02:25:20.750 --> 02:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
body or do you look at the toe and and
 
02:25:23.710 --> 02:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
that that's the concern and that's why
 
02:25:26.469 --> 02:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
the letter was worded the way it was mad
 
02:25:29.670 --> 02:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
Madam chair but um and I also want to
 
02:25:31.990 --> 02:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
make clear that uh representative MC
 
02:25:34.710 --> 02:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
Williams is not on Judiciary she brought
 
02:25:38.349 --> 02:25:38.359 align:start position:0%
the bill to us and it was uh you know
 
02:25:40.910 --> 02:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary Committee that that then
 
02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
went on from from there um but so that's
 
02:25:48.429 --> 02:25:48.439 align:start position:0%
that's my concern thank thank you
 
02:25:50.990 --> 02:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
Senator so my topics to Mike
 
02:25:54.110 --> 02:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
um so we we just closed out at least two
 
02:25:55.710 --> 02:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
audits with the third one be done in the
 
02:25:57.630 --> 02:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
next three to four weeks and my question
 
02:25:58.990 --> 02:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
is do we need to add anything to your
 
02:26:01.469 --> 02:26:01.479 align:start position:0%
list so your people can continue to work
 
02:26:03.670 --> 02:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh Christine
 
02:26:05.830 --> 02:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
and Jay will be able to provide that to
 
02:26:07.630 --> 02:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
you because they have some ideas I think
 
02:26:09.150 --> 02:26:09.160 align:start position:0%
they are looking for topics because we
 
02:26:10.670 --> 02:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
do not have the Secretary of State out
 
02:26:12.590 --> 02:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
it anymore I think the EFA is going to
 
02:26:13.830 --> 02:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
move you know we have a lot of work to
 
02:26:16.110 --> 02:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
do before we start so if Jay Henry could
 
02:26:17.830 --> 02:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
come up and just
 
02:26:21.870 --> 02:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
uh talk to you about that 10
 
02:26:24.349 --> 02:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
thank you one other thing is you know I
 
02:26:25.990 --> 02:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
realize the four councils have different
 
02:26:27.710 --> 02:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
appeals processes but there may be a
 
02:26:29.670 --> 02:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
reason for that perhaps it would be good
 
02:26:31.469 --> 02:26:31.479 align:start position:0%
to hear either from the commissioner of
 
02:26:34.830 --> 02:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
De or perhaps director whims they could
 
02:26:36.750 --> 02:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
speak to maybe why there's four
 
02:26:38.190 --> 02:26:38.200 align:start position:0%
different appeals processes that might
 
02:26:40.910 --> 02:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
clear some of the concern prior to a
 
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
good idea prior to putting together a
 
02:26:45.309 --> 02:26:45.319 align:start position:0%
well I I just talked to Steve Grady our
 
02:26:48.429 --> 02:26:48.439 align:start position:0%
in charge who did the wetlands audit uh
 
02:26:50.910 --> 02:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
back a few years ago and part of that
 
02:26:53.389 --> 02:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
was the wetlands Council and so there
 
02:26:55.030 --> 02:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
was I think there was about a chapter
 
02:26:57.389 --> 02:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
that talked about the W Wetlands Council
 
02:26:59.190 --> 02:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
but he told me they didn't really get
 
02:27:02.070 --> 02:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
involved in the hearings process however
 
02:27:04.429 --> 02:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
he did mention that the reason why
 
02:27:06.710 --> 02:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
there's each Council has a like
 
02:27:09.750 --> 02:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
different rules or procedures they were
 
02:27:12.309 --> 02:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
separated they were glued together at
 
02:27:14.070 --> 02:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
one point to become the department
 
02:27:16.389 --> 02:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
enironmental services so that's probably
 
02:27:19.469 --> 02:27:19.479 align:start position:0%
the reason why each Council does it
 
02:27:21.349 --> 02:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
their own way sure I just thought that
 
02:27:22.990 --> 02:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
might be a valuable piece of information
 
02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
to help if we're going to put a scope
 
02:27:26.750 --> 02:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
together to perhaps understand let's
 
02:27:31.349 --> 02:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
invite Commissioners gone to the N
 
02:27:34.070 --> 02:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
meeting the only other thing I when I
 
02:27:36.550 --> 02:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
was listening you know where Auditors
 
02:27:39.030 --> 02:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
were doing how well did the program run
 
02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:40.309 align:start position:0%
were doing how well did the program run
efficiency

02:27:40.309 --> 02:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
02:27:44.630 --> 02:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness um policy meaning
 
02:27:47.070 --> 02:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
changing how you're going to organize
 
02:27:50.190 --> 02:27:50.200 align:start position:0%
all these these these councils that may
 
02:27:52.150 --> 02:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
maybe beyond what our traditional scope
 
02:27:54.670 --> 02:27:54.680 align:start position:0%
is so what you know deciding what are
 
02:27:56.469 --> 02:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
what we should look at which may help
 
02:27:59.030 --> 02:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
you with policy but I don't know if it's
 
02:28:02.389 --> 02:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
our duty to say here's the best way for
 
02:28:04.910 --> 02:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
these councils to operate I mean we may
 
02:28:06.630 --> 02:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
be able to look at other states and you
 
02:28:09.190 --> 02:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
know you know give you some information
 
02:28:10.870 --> 02:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
but you know we try not to go over that
 
02:28:15.230 --> 02:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
line of suggesting policy to the
 
02:28:17.990 --> 02:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
legislature well I'm still interested in
 
02:28:20.990 --> 02:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
a performance audit of the door way
 
02:28:24.429 --> 02:28:24.439 align:start position:0%
program because it's a we keep hearing
 
02:28:29.710 --> 02:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
that overdoses are going up I think
 
02:28:33.910 --> 02:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
they're and deaths in most places deaths
 
02:28:35.150 --> 02:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
are going
 
02:28:38.190 --> 02:28:38.200 align:start position:0%
down not necessarily in Manchester or
 
02:28:43.550 --> 02:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
Nashua but would be good to um I think
 
02:28:47.550 --> 02:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
know how quickly and
 
02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
efficiently people are
 
02:28:54.269 --> 02:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
hooked up with Treatment Services
 
02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
because the the purpose of
 
02:29:01.349 --> 02:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
this a Statewide program is to get
 
02:29:04.030 --> 02:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
people quickly
 
02:29:07.469 --> 02:29:07.479 align:start position:0%
connected with Treatment
 
02:29:11.389 --> 02:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
Services can people afford it how long
 
02:29:15.110 --> 02:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
is the wait how many calls go to the
 
02:29:18.590 --> 02:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
nighttime and weekend call center rather
 
02:29:22.870 --> 02:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
than the Monday through Friday daytime
 
02:29:26.870 --> 02:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
operation so I think that's still worth
 
02:29:29.710 --> 02:29:29.720 align:start position:0%
looking at as well and that program's
 
02:29:32.750 --> 02:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
been operating for at least five years
 
02:29:37.389 --> 02:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:40.429 --> 02:29:40.439 align:start position:0%
it hold again I want first we got to
 
02:29:43.030 --> 02:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
find out how much work they need so we
 
02:29:44.670 --> 02:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
have an idea of what we're going to vote
 
02:29:46.349 --> 02:29:46.359 align:start position:0%
on and what might be because for me I
 
02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
have a different priority and that's the
 
02:29:50.349 --> 02:29:50.359 align:start position:0%
DHHS and children's Behavioral Health
 
02:29:52.590 --> 02:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
right so but first let's find out what
 
02:29:54.389 --> 02:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
they have room
 
02:29:57.710 --> 02:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
for okay thank you so there's a long
 
02:30:00.309 --> 02:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
list of audit topics here that are
 
02:30:02.630 --> 02:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
suspended and we're hoping to tidy up
 
02:30:04.510 --> 02:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
this list a little bit and sort of
 
02:30:06.670 --> 02:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
prioritize so we'd like to hear from the
 
02:30:08.750 --> 02:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
committee on each one of these if
 
02:30:11.469 --> 02:30:11.479 align:start position:0%
possible uh the first one was Bureau of
 
02:30:14.750 --> 02:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
elderly and Adult Services this topic
 
02:30:18.030 --> 02:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
was suspended more than two years ago um
 
02:30:21.349 --> 02:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
in November of 2021 due to a legal
 
02:30:23.469 --> 02:30:23.479 align:start position:0%
proceeding uh we haven't received an
 
02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
update on this so just wondering if
 
02:30:27.389 --> 02:30:27.399 align:start position:0%
there's further discussion on this do we
 
02:30:29.309 --> 02:30:29.319 align:start position:0%
want to keep this topic on the list or
 
02:30:33.990 --> 02:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
remove it um has that litigation
 
02:30:38.630 --> 02:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
resolved no I don't think so
 
02:30:44.870 --> 02:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:48.990 --> 02:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
okay forward at the moment okay next is
 
02:30:51.670 --> 02:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
the um public access to bodies of water
 
02:30:54.150 --> 02:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
that was tabled as it was noted there
 
02:30:57.190 --> 02:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
might be another committee responsible
 
02:30:58.590 --> 02:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
uh for this
 
02:31:01.750 --> 02:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
topic do we have any further discussion
 
02:31:03.230 --> 02:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
do we want to keep it on the list or
 
02:31:03.240 --> 02:31:07.429 align:start position:0%
do we want to keep it on the list or
remove

02:31:07.429 --> 02:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:10.910 --> 02:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
it my guess is we should probably we
 
02:31:12.389 --> 02:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
should probably knowing that we want to
 
02:31:13.630 --> 02:31:13.640 align:start position:0%
either remove things or not we probably
 
02:31:15.230 --> 02:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
got to do a little research so I'm not
 
02:31:16.630 --> 02:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
sure going to get any votes to remove
 
02:31:19.110 --> 02:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
anything from the list today okay um but
 
02:31:20.389 --> 02:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
knowing that you do want to remove
 
02:31:21.630 --> 02:31:21.640 align:start position:0%
things we can start looking at them and
 
02:31:23.590 --> 02:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
see which items and where they stand and
 
02:31:25.309 --> 02:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
and look to the next meeting as to
 
02:31:27.750 --> 02:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
making a a recommendation for what items
 
02:31:29.150 --> 02:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
we want to ultimately remove off the
 
02:31:30.990 --> 02:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
list to at least that would be my
 
02:31:32.309 --> 02:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the
 
02:31:36.309 --> 02:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
chair may I comment yes sen well some of
 
02:31:38.510 --> 02:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
us are somewhat new to this committee
 
02:31:40.670 --> 02:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
having only been on a little over a year
 
02:31:42.269 --> 02:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
I I really don't know the history on
 
02:31:44.190 --> 02:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
many of these things and it's difficult
 
02:31:46.590 --> 02:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
for me to say yeah remove it or yes keep
 
02:31:49.309 --> 02:31:49.319 align:start position:0%
it on is there possibility that you
 
02:31:51.230 --> 02:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
could at least give us uh some typee of
 
02:31:53.750 --> 02:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
a briefing as to what each one you know
 
02:31:55.790 --> 02:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
like a simple paragraph that would say
 
02:31:59.070 --> 02:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
like the office of the oplc one it was
 
02:32:01.349 --> 02:32:01.359 align:start position:0%
tabled but what what in general was it
 
02:32:03.110 --> 02:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
trying to look at because it's real hard
 
02:32:04.550 --> 02:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
to know whether I want to remove it or
 
02:32:07.710 --> 02:32:07.720 align:start position:0%
not sure I'm also new to the committee
 
02:32:09.670 --> 02:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
but yes we can certainly provide a
 
02:32:12.070 --> 02:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
little update on that and give you a
 
02:32:14.070 --> 02:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
summary of what the topics were I think
 
02:32:15.950 --> 02:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
they'd be very beneficial to many of us
 
02:32:17.230 --> 02:32:17.240 align:start position:0%
trying to decide whether we want to keep
 
02:32:20.469 --> 02:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
these or removed okay absolutely y I
 
02:32:22.309 --> 02:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
don't expect we're going to make any
 
02:32:25.150 --> 02:32:25.160 align:start position:0%
decisions okay right but if you could
 
02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
tell us how much space you have so next
 
02:32:28.030 --> 02:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
meeting if you want to move something
 
02:32:29.870 --> 02:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
forward we have an idea of how much work
 
02:32:35.110 --> 02:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
you want sure so we have one um
 
02:32:37.389 --> 02:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
performance audit manager that will be
 
02:32:42.870 --> 02:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
freeing up probably in April so we are
 
02:32:45.110 --> 02:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
looking for one topic uh now that the
 
02:32:47.950 --> 02:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
archives audit is off the list we will
 
02:32:52.190 --> 02:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
definitely need at least one topic very
 
02:32:55.910 --> 02:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
soon Madam chair for my purposes again
 
02:32:58.349 --> 02:32:58.359 align:start position:0%
having that recent case with the child
 
02:33:00.510 --> 02:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
with having been stuck in the Ed room
 
02:33:04.590 --> 02:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
for ages he he's all set now but but
 
02:33:08.309 --> 02:33:08.319 align:start position:0%
when the wind stop yeah so the so my my
 
02:33:09.910 --> 02:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
my uh and thank you for your help on
 
02:33:11.830 --> 02:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
that case to get that child taken care
 
02:33:14.429 --> 02:33:14.439 align:start position:0%
of but I'm interested in interplay
 
02:33:16.429 --> 02:33:16.439 align:start position:0%
between DHHS and the and the behavioral
 
02:33:17.910 --> 02:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
health and mental health services
 
02:33:19.510 --> 02:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
component moving that forward as a big
 
02:33:22.510 --> 02:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
topic for me to uh it's not an area I've
 
02:33:24.389 --> 02:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
usually focused on but now that I've had
 
02:33:26.429 --> 02:33:26.439 align:start position:0%
my eyes open to it I'm I'm really
 
02:33:28.190 --> 02:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
interested in how the state's managing
 
02:33:30.469 --> 02:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
this process and how we're getting our
 
02:33:32.349 --> 02:33:32.359 align:start position:0%
children especially the mental health
 
02:33:34.110 --> 02:33:34.120 align:start position:0%
services children the services they need
 
02:33:37.110 --> 02:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
as fast as possible um and so for me
 
02:33:38.630 --> 02:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
that would be a topic that I'd be really
 
02:33:40.389 --> 02:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
interested moving forward next next
 
02:33:43.830 --> 02:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
meeting if if everybody agrees but this
 
02:33:47.030 --> 02:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
is about the interplay between well I
 
02:33:48.269 --> 02:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
think that was part of the problem we
 
02:33:52.110 --> 02:33:52.120 align:start position:0%
had a little bit yeah to want to revise
 
02:33:53.950 --> 02:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
that topic well again that's where I
 
02:33:57.750 --> 02:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
think having a little one
 
02:34:01.230 --> 02:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph right because that was not
 
02:34:06.910 --> 02:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
ad right so anyway yeah um
 
02:34:11.309 --> 02:34:11.319 align:start position:0%
great okay so sounds like we need a new
 
02:34:13.990 --> 02:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
another meeting quite quickly yeah yeah
 
02:34:15.870 --> 02:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
uh we need a
 
02:34:26.190 --> 02:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:29.110 --> 02:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
what April Fool's Day wouldn't that
 
02:34:29.120 --> 02:34:31.790 align:start position:0%
what April Fool's Day wouldn't that
be

02:34:31.790 --> 02:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:34:34.469 --> 02:34:34.479 align:start position:0%
I I could do
 
02:34:39.389 --> 02:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:42.190 --> 02:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
available 15th is going to be tougher
 
02:34:45.790 --> 02:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
for me I'm available is Commission on
 
02:34:48.510 --> 02:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
Aging I I made an exception for today
 
02:34:50.469 --> 02:34:50.479 align:start position:0%
but I'd like not to miss it twice when
 
02:34:54.030 --> 02:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
is that uh that's the 15th
 
02:34:57.429 --> 02:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
okay I could do I could do the eth the
 
02:34:59.750 --> 02:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
eth is the eclipse folks I don't want to
 
02:35:04.110 --> 02:35:04.120 align:start position:0%
mess up that for the morning of the eth
 
02:35:05.429 --> 02:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
but not the
 
02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon anybody needing to get up to
 
02:35:09.469 --> 02:35:09.479 align:start position:0%
the North Country may be upset about
 
02:35:12.710 --> 02:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
that what was the problem with the first
 
02:35:16.309 --> 02:35:16.319 align:start position:0%
96% coverage right here in concerete
 
02:35:18.469 --> 02:35:18.479 align:start position:0%
does the eth work in the morning are you
 
02:35:20.309 --> 02:35:20.319 align:start position:0%
talking about April 8th it certainly
 
02:35:22.469 --> 02:35:22.479 align:start position:0%
works for me I don't have S you're
 
02:35:25.590 --> 02:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
talking about April 8 yeah morning yeah

before 10 well I know we have meetings
 
02:35:33.110 --> 02:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
but Howard I'm fine with it but I I
 
02:35:34.950 --> 02:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
think representative Weber may be making
 
02:35:36.389 --> 02:35:36.399 align:start position:0%
a point that maybe some folks to take
 
02:35:38.469 --> 02:35:38.479 align:start position:0%
the day off to go to see the eclipse and
 
02:35:40.710 --> 02:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that affects who we have
 
02:35:45.389 --> 02:35:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:48.349 --> 02:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
second that was all I was thinking I'm
 
02:35:51.309 --> 02:35:51.319 align:start position:0%
personally not going before
 
02:35:53.590 --> 02:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
one I could
 
02:35:56.510 --> 02:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
do education yeah yeah I can't I can't
 
02:35:59.110 --> 02:35:59.120 align:start position:0%

02:36:01.429 --> 02:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
the best day Monday's the best what was
 
02:36:04.190 --> 02:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
what was wrong with a April
 
02:36:08.030 --> 02:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
1 you're fooling right nothing no why
 
02:36:09.790 --> 02:36:09.800 align:start position:0%

02:36:24.030 --> 02:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
I'm really
 
02:36:27.550 --> 02:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
sorry was but I think you know we have a
 
02:36:30.550 --> 02:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
birthday and an unavailability so maybe
 
02:36:32.429 --> 02:36:32.439 align:start position:0%
happy birthday to Senator General on
 
02:36:36.550 --> 02:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
first but what was the problem with the
 
02:36:41.429 --> 02:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
22nd of 2 next week no the 22nd of April
 
02:36:42.830 --> 02:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
looking for early April so we can get
 
02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
them because we took right we need to
 
02:36:48.150 --> 02:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
give them Madam chair yes I just wanted
 
02:36:50.230 --> 02:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
to let you know that we we could
 
02:36:54.230 --> 02:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
possibly put off receiving a topic for
 
02:36:56.710 --> 02:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
like a for a month 30 days so it's not
 
02:36:58.910 --> 02:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
we don't need it in two weeks so I just
 
02:37:01.150 --> 02:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
want to let you know that in case you so
 
02:37:04.110 --> 02:37:04.120 align:start position:0%
if we met on the 22nd would that be okay
 
02:37:06.990 --> 02:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
of April or the 15th the 15th was
 
02:37:08.950 --> 02:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
commissioned on Aging for me and
 
02:37:11.269 --> 02:37:11.279 align:start position:0%

no if I could also mention the other
 
02:37:43.469 --> 02:37:43.479 align:start position:0%
consideration is we were thinking at the
 
02:37:45.389 --> 02:37:45.399 align:start position:0%
next meeting we could possibly have the
 
02:37:47.710 --> 02:37:47.720 align:start position:0%
scope statement for the education
 
02:37:49.790 --> 02:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
Freedom account program now that we
 
02:37:52.469 --> 02:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
received clarification today about about
 
02:37:54.550 --> 02:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
the uh scope of the audit but if we do
 
02:37:56.590 --> 02:37:56.600 align:start position:0%
schedule the meeting for April 1st we
 
02:37:58.269 --> 02:37:58.279 align:start position:0%
might be a little short on time for
 
02:37:59.590 --> 02:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
having the scope statement at that
 
02:38:02.230 --> 02:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
meeting so I'll just give you that
 
02:38:03.870 --> 02:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
