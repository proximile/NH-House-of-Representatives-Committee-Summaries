were having a conversation um I rise
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
today to speak against the floor
 
00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:08.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh what the floor Amendment
 
00:54:10.589 --> 00:54:10.599 align:start position:0%
does is it changes this horrible Bill
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
and tries to make it a little better um
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
but Mr Speaker um making going from
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
mandatory to optional is just a Gateway
 
00:54:20.589 --> 00:54:20.599 align:start position:0%
back to mandatory so it's a bad bill
 
00:54:21.789 --> 00:54:21.799 align:start position:0%
there's no point trying to make it
 
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
better I urge the body to oppose the
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:35.920 align:start position:0%

representative

00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:41.240 align:start position:0%
Wayne thank you Mr Speaker um this
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
amendment addresses the two major issues
 
00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
that were raised by the clerks in the
 
00:54:50.549 --> 00:54:50.559 align:start position:0%
public hearing on the bill as it stands
 
00:54:53.549 --> 00:54:53.559 align:start position:0%
now the bill requires at least two days
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
of partial processing for absente
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
ballots and does not provide them any
 
00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
guidance on how to cure those absentee
 
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
ballots that have correctable defects
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
the amendment makes the pre-processing
 
00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
optional so it's an enabling act for a
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
period of up to two days and requires
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
the clerks to follow the guidance that
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state will issue in the
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
election manual this amendment has been
 
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:27.880 align:start position:0%
approved by Matt Norman the Manchester
 
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:31.000 align:start position:0%

00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
Association the amendment provides the
 
00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
clerks with a tool in the event they
 
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
receive a large number of absentee
 
00:55:50.309 --> 00:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
ballots right now they would have to
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
rely on another emergency executive
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
order issued by the governor as was done
 
00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:57.670 align:start position:0%
order issued by the governor as was done
in

00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%

2020 they prefer to know that this
 
00:56:03.309 --> 00:56:03.319 align:start position:0%
optional processing is a tool that's in
 
00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:06.440 align:start position:0%
their toolbox if they decide it's needed
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
in their town the amendment requires the
 
00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%

correctable defects on the outer
 
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
envelope contrary to what um you may he
 
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:23.240 align:start position:0%
curing an absentee ballot does not
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
create two classes of Voters inperson
 
00:56:29.549 --> 00:56:29.559 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr
 
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
Speaker good morning colleagues the
 
01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
underlying bill here uh is to issue a
 
01:19:36.910 --> 01:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
report um from a study conducted by the
 
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
wellness and primary prevention Council
 
01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
um it's they're named in the original
 
01:19:44.430 --> 01:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
Bill to do this study but they have some
 
01:19:47.229 --> 01:19:47.239 align:start position:0%
voting members member organizations that
 
01:19:49.629 --> 01:19:49.639 align:start position:0%
currently do and or may contract with
 
01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
the state to provide home visiting
 
01:19:53.669 --> 01:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
Services um therefore it's more
 
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate for this body to form a
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
legislative study committee to just
 
01:20:00.669 --> 01:20:00.679 align:start position:0%
ensure that degree of separation and
 
01:20:03.149 --> 01:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
impartiality um and to approach the
 
01:20:05.790 --> 01:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
issue from a a stance of looking at what
 
01:20:08.189 --> 01:20:08.199 align:start position:0%
resources are available now for home
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
visits and then asking the question of
 
01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
is a robust centralized system for
 
01:20:17.470 --> 01:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
voluntary home visits
 
01:20:20.350 --> 01:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
needed um rather than starting from a
 
01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:23.560 align:start position:0%
presumption that one is so I would uh if
 
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
you would please support the floor
 
01:20:27.709 --> 01:20:27.719 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank

visiting before and after the birth of a
 
01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
child is something that's been done for
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
decades and decades and decades and we
 
01:20:56.709 --> 01:20:56.719 align:start position:0%
have lots and lots and lots lots of data
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
on how helpful it is for families to
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
strengthen families to promote the
 
01:21:08.629 --> 01:21:08.639 align:start position:0%
health of the new infant to reassure new
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%

the
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
amendment requires that we start from
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
scratch and
 
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
study the programs that
 
01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
exist uh whether they who who's
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
delivering them how they're delivered
 
01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
whether they're causing harm to families
 
01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.669 align:start position:0%
whether they're causing harm to families
or

01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
not and it requires us to start again
 
01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:54.280 align:start position:0%
with a study committee of legislators
 
01:21:57.910 --> 01:21:57.920 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker chair recognize

01:23:27.790 --> 01:23:27.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker my colleague is
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
right in the past number of decades the
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
government has been very involved in um
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
promoting more of these home visits but
 
01:23:37.149 --> 01:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
for Millennia families and the
 
01:23:38.590 --> 01:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
communities around them have been
 
01:23:41.070 --> 01:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
involved in visiting with families when
 
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
a child is born a form family is formed
 
01:23:46.590 --> 01:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
the blood family but larger the
 
01:23:50.629 --> 01:23:50.639 align:start position:0%
community family is formed yes in recent
 
01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
times we've moved away from supporting
 
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
our neighbors often times because
 
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
because we're so busy and we're doing so
 
01:23:58.350 --> 01:23:58.360 align:start position:0%
many things and we expect that somebody
 
01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
will step in and do our job for us
 
01:24:05.229 --> 01:24:05.239 align:start position:0%
meanwhile we have grandmothers home
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
isolated from their children from their
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
grandchildren who are across the country
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
while another young family is bringing a
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
child into the world and their parent is
 
01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
also far away rather than looking at
 
01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
just our birth families we have our
 
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to grow our community
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
families and bring this engagement
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
one of the determinants of health is
 
01:24:29.709 --> 01:24:29.719 align:start position:0%
community involvement we have three
 
01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
major life events that happen to us that
 
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
bring Community together birth marriage
 
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
and death birth is a source of creation
 
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
not just in the family and we should
 
01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
ensure that as we look to where home
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
visiting is needed through the
 
01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
government lens we're also looking at
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
what's happening the the committee would
 
01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
look at duelist we would look at other
 
01:24:52.350 --> 01:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
things where people are coming in as
 
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
part of the community and we would
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that there is more than just
 
01:24:58.750 --> 01:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
the government who helps a family so
 
01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
rather than going with an assumption
 
01:25:02.229 --> 01:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
that we're going to continue down this
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
path of the government stepping in and
 
01:25:05.950 --> 01:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
helping you with a family let's look
 
01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
back to the Millennia about how we form
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
as humans how and importantly how we
 
01:25:12.109 --> 01:25:12.119 align:start position:0%
form as a community to support each
 
01:25:13.709 --> 01:25:13.719 align:start position:0%
other and make sure that we're not
 
01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
shutting the door on that empty nester

Speaker s SP 185 establishes a committee
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
to study the various barriers to

discharge for patients to be safely
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
discharged from acute care facilities
 
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
the Genesis of this bill is that
 
01:32:34.669 --> 01:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
initially the bill was entitled relative
 
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
to protective services for vulnerable
 
01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
adults in the definition of Abandonment
 
01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
and it appears there were proposals for
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
the bill to include Draconian penalties
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
for caregivers or family members who
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
quote abandoned their Wards or family
 
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
members which was just not practical nor
 
01:32:59.030 --> 01:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
legal during the baate on SP 185 and the
 
01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
other bod's committee hearings the
 
01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
committee learned that there has been a
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
sharp increase in the number of
 
01:33:08.189 --> 01:33:08.199 align:start position:0%
discharged patients who have no place to
 
01:33:10.750 --> 01:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
go after
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
discharge at the same time there are a
 
01:33:16.510 --> 01:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
number of adult patients waiting for
 
01:33:19.629 --> 01:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
medical beds who cannot get beds for
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
these reasons the other body's Judiciary
 
01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
Committee voted to retain
 
01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:27.520 align:start position:0%

01:33:54.270 --> 01:33:54.280 align:start position:0%
that need to be resolved
 
01:33:58.149 --> 01:33:58.159 align:start position:0%

for our health care
 
01:34:53.310 --> 01:34:53.320 align:start position:0%

minority of this committee feels this
 
01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:19.280 align:start position:0%

to save the legislature time and money
 
01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:51.719 align:start position:0%

vote before I read that and everybody
 
01:40:45.390 --> 01:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
starts running out of the room I'm
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
asking I'm requesting that all of you
 
01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
stay in your
 
01:40:52.430 --> 01:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
seats we're going to have a presentation
 
01:40:55.149 --> 01:40:55.159 align:start position:0%
that could depend on your safety and
 
01:40:57.790 --> 01:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
your colleague safety from the director
 
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
of uh Safety Services and that's going
 
01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
to probably take maybe 10 12 minutes so
 
01:41:07.790 --> 01:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
once I read the lunch uh announcements
 
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to go into recess and we're
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
going to have that presentation and
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to explain to you if we
 
01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
have an emergency how to get out of here
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
and what to do so this could very well
 
01:41:23.550 --> 01:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
hopefully it would never happen happens
 
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
and we never need it but this could
 
01:41:27.149 --> 01:41:27.159 align:start position:0%
depend on your safety and your colleague
 
01:41:29.109 --> 01:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
safety so I'm asking you to listen to
 
01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:31.840 align:start position:0%

speaker Mr Speaker I rise today in
 
03:11:53.870 --> 03:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
opposition to Amendment
 
03:11:57.030 --> 03:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
1678 this amendment is unre unrelated to
 
03:11:59.110 --> 03:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill regarding civil
 
03:12:01.830 --> 03:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
actions for pasas contamination which I
 
03:12:05.389 --> 03:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
do support instead this amendment
 
03:12:08.150 --> 03:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
inserts language on this underlying Bill
 
03:12:10.910 --> 03:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
to reverse a longstanding protection for
 
03:12:13.150 --> 03:12:13.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire renters and allows
 
03:12:15.670 --> 03:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
landlords to evict tenants at the end of
 
03:12:18.429 --> 03:12:18.439 align:start position:0%
their lease without giving any reason
 
03:12:20.190 --> 03:12:20.200 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether they are up to-
 
03:12:22.550 --> 03:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
date on their rent and they've followed
 
03:12:25.030 --> 03:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
all the rules and conditions of their
 
03:12:27.710 --> 03:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
lease this is not the first time we've
 
03:12:30.309 --> 03:12:30.319 align:start position:0%
seen this previously most of the
 
03:12:33.150 --> 03:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
testimony in favor of making this change
 
03:12:34.910 --> 03:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
has revolved around a court case from
 
03:12:38.070 --> 03:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
several decades ago today I would like
 
03:12:40.750 --> 03:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
to reframe the debate and speak about it
 
03:12:43.469 --> 03:12:43.479 align:start position:0%
in the context of our current 2020
 
03:12:45.830 --> 03:12:45.840 align:start position:0%

03:12:48.550 --> 03:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
ramifications for the

03:12:56.070 --> 03:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
state we're all aware that New Hampshire
 
03:12:58.950 --> 03:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
has a critical shortage of housing units
 
03:13:01.950 --> 03:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
both for purchase and rent we have
 
03:13:04.030 --> 03:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
worked diligently this session to
 
03:13:06.349 --> 03:13:06.359 align:start position:0%
identify potential solutions for this
 
03:13:06.359 --> 03:13:07.550 align:start position:0%

vexing
 
03:13:09.870 --> 03:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
problem this shortage has led to
 
03:13:12.750 --> 03:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
escalating sale prices and rents the

average purchase price for a home in New

Hampshire is 520
 
03:13:20.349 --> 03:13:20.359 align:start position:0%
$5,000 the average rent for a

two-bedroom apartment is
 
03:13:27.269 --> 03:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
$1,900 the third highest in the country
 
03:13:29.990 --> 03:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
the vacancy rate is
 
03:13:33.150 --> 03:13:33.160 align:start position:0%

incomes if you make 80 to 100% of area

Market is not like it was 20 years ago
 
03:14:50.870 --> 03:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
today you need to provide proof that you
 
03:14:53.150 --> 03:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
make three times the amount of rent per
 
03:14:56.469 --> 03:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
month a cost burden renters apartment
 
03:14:58.190 --> 03:14:58.200 align:start position:0%
may have been affordable when they moved
 
03:15:00.910 --> 03:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
in but now after years of escalating
 
03:15:03.830 --> 03:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
rents they are no longer qualified to
 
03:15:06.830 --> 03:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
live in their homes I spoke to one woman
 
03:15:09.790 --> 03:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
in my district who saw her rent go up
 
03:15:13.190 --> 03:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
$650 a month these people live in
 
03:15:15.550 --> 03:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
constant fear of losing their homes
 
03:15:17.269 --> 03:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
because if they do it will will be
 
03:15:20.229 --> 03:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
nearly impossible to find another place
 
03:15:21.510 --> 03:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
they are the ones who have turned to
 
03:15:23.630 --> 03:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
food banks they are the ones who have
 
03:15:25.830 --> 03:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
taken on second and third jobs in order
 
03:15:26.990 --> 03:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
to pay the
 
03:15:30.110 --> 03:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
rent that's enough data when I was on
 
03:15:31.950 --> 03:15:31.960 align:start position:0%
the school board my superintendent used
 
03:15:34.269 --> 03:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
to say data is great for giving you the
 
03:15:36.870 --> 03:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
40,000 foot view but what you really
 
03:15:38.590 --> 03:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
need to make a decision is to look at
 
03:15:39.710 --> 03:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
the ground
 
03:15:41.790 --> 03:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
truth so I'm going to give you some
 
03:15:43.750 --> 03:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
ground truth about what really happens
 
03:15:46.269 --> 03:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
to people who are in this situation let
 
03:15:47.469 --> 03:15:47.479 align:start position:0%
me tell you about
 
03:15:50.349 --> 03:15:50.359 align:start position:0%
Rachel who was here today with us in the
 
03:15:52.870 --> 03:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
gallery she testified before the other
 
03:15:54.510 --> 03:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
body on this
 
03:15:59.070 --> 03:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
issue Rachel for years lived with her
 
03:16:00.950 --> 03:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
family her husband and her granddaughter
 
03:16:03.309 --> 03:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
in an apartment in Manchester they were
 
03:16:05.910 --> 03:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
good tenants they paid their rent and
 
03:16:07.950 --> 03:16:07.960 align:start position:0%
they made an effort to keep their place
 
03:16:11.910 --> 03:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
nice unfortunately Rachel has a lot of
 
03:16:13.830 --> 03:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
serious health problems and is on
 
03:16:17.429 --> 03:16:17.439 align:start position:0%
disability as is her husband but
 
03:16:21.189 --> 03:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
but they made it work somehow one day
 
03:16:22.590 --> 03:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
their landlord told them that they
 
03:16:24.189 --> 03:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
needed to move because he wanted to
 
03:16:26.750 --> 03:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
renovate their apartment they were being
 
03:16:28.790 --> 03:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
evicted though they had done nothing
 
03:16:32.229 --> 03:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
wrong they had 30 days to find another
 
03:16:35.110 --> 03:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
place Rachel got to work searching for
 
03:16:37.870 --> 03:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
an apartment for them she'd see an
 
03:16:41.110 --> 03:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
apartment for $1,500 a month it was
 
03:16:43.389 --> 03:16:43.399 align:start position:0%
steep but she could make it work she'd
 
03:16:45.229 --> 03:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
call the landlord or management company
 
03:16:47.950 --> 03:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
and they'd ask her can you provide proof
 
03:16:50.790 --> 03:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
that you make three times the rent
 
03:16:54.950 --> 03:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
$4,500 a month sorry I can't then we
 
03:16:56.469 --> 03:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
can't rent you this
 
03:16:59.189 --> 03:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
apartment eventually they were evicted
 
03:17:01.750 --> 03:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
and became homeless the stress caused
 
03:17:03.830 --> 03:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
Rachel's husband to have a severe Health
 
03:17:06.469 --> 03:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
setback they had to go to court they
 
03:17:09.349 --> 03:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
moved into a hotel and in spite of her
 
03:17:12.429 --> 03:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
best efforts it took two years for
 
03:17:14.990 --> 03:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
Rachel to finally find an
 
03:17:17.110 --> 03:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
apartment if we passed the this
 
03:17:19.229 --> 03:17:19.239 align:start position:0%
amendment Rachel and her family could
 
03:17:21.110 --> 03:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
find themselves in the exact same
 
03:17:24.229 --> 03:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
situation when their lease ends and now
 
03:17:26.710 --> 03:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
in addition to her financial constraints
 
03:17:29.630 --> 03:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
she has an eviction on her record and
 
03:17:31.510 --> 03:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
after three years it's not going to say
 
03:17:32.950 --> 03:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
why she was
 
03:17:35.710 --> 03:17:35.720 align:start position:0%
evicted so people will naturally assume
 
03:17:37.469 --> 03:17:37.479 align:start position:0%
it was for non-payment of
 
03:17:40.630 --> 03:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
rent Rachel's case is Not
 
03:17:43.630 --> 03:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
Unusual every month 400 people in New
 
03:17:46.189 --> 03:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are getting evicted mostly
 
03:17:47.790 --> 03:17:47.800 align:start position:0%
because they have lost the battle
 
03:17:50.630 --> 03:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
against Rising rents we need that number
 
03:17:54.469 --> 03:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
to go down not up I ask only that we
 
03:17:56.229 --> 03:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
don't choose to undermine the work that
 
03:17:58.389 --> 03:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
we have been so focused on these last
 
03:18:01.750 --> 03:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
two years and urge my colleagues to vote
 
03:18:03.790 --> 03:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
no on this amendment thank you and I
 
03:18:05.910 --> 03:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
request a roll call
 
03:18:14.950 --> 03:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:17.429 --> 03:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
Smith okay chair recognized
 
03:18:17.439 --> 03:18:22.469 align:start position:0%
Smith okay chair recognized
representative

03:18:22.469 --> 03:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:24.910 --> 03:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
ly thank you Mr
 
03:18:27.309 --> 03:18:27.319 align:start position:0%
Speaker the bill from the other body
 
03:18:30.189 --> 03:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
creates uh Express private right creates
 
03:18:32.510 --> 03:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
an Express private right of action for
 
03:18:36.429 --> 03:18:36.439 align:start position:0%
past contamination and also grants ex uh
 
03:18:39.030 --> 03:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
expanded remedies it's basically a good
 
03:18:40.590 --> 03:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
bill I think they could argue about is
 
03:18:43.349 --> 03:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
it absolutely necessary I think there
 
03:18:44.710 --> 03:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
there there could be an argument but I
 
03:18:48.150 --> 03:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
think basically it's a good bill
 
03:18:50.030 --> 03:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment adds to the bill the
 
03:18:53.309 --> 03:18:53.319 align:start position:0%
substance of HB 1115 which this house
 
03:18:56.030 --> 03:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
passed earlier this session after a
 
03:18:58.510 --> 03:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
debate in which we basically considered
 
03:19:00.630 --> 03:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
the same issues that were just uh that
 
03:19:04.110 --> 03:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
were just addressed uh by the previous
 
03:19:07.830 --> 03:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
speaker that's the hb1 1115 is the bill
 
03:19:09.510 --> 03:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
that allows landlords to terminate a
 
03:19:12.150 --> 03:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
lease at the end of the lease term it
 
03:19:15.510 --> 03:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with changing the law
 
03:19:19.229 --> 03:19:19.239 align:start position:0%
about uh uh a renovation of property
 
03:19:21.269 --> 03:19:21.279 align:start position:0%
being a grounds for eviction it is a
 
03:19:23.389 --> 03:19:23.399 align:start position:0%
grounds for eviction it'll be a grounds
 
03:19:26.110 --> 03:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
for eviction whether we pass this bill
 
03:19:27.950 --> 03:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
or not this bill has really nothing to
 
03:19:30.229 --> 03:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
do with that much of the argument you
 
03:19:33.110 --> 03:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
heard really had talked about the you
 
03:19:35.710 --> 03:19:35.720 align:start position:0%
know significant problems we have in the
 
03:19:37.269 --> 03:19:37.279 align:start position:0%
housing market right now and there's no
 
03:19:38.990 --> 03:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
dispute about that that's absolutely
 
03:19:41.110 --> 03:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
true but what you didn't really hear is
 
03:19:43.389 --> 03:19:43.399 align:start position:0%
how that AR how that relates to this
 
03:19:47.150 --> 03:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
bill and why it makes sense
 
03:19:50.710 --> 03:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
to say to have the law be that a
 
03:19:53.910 --> 03:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
contract saying you have a contract for
 
03:19:57.670 --> 03:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
a specific term means is enforcable by
 
03:20:00.550 --> 03:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
the tenant but is not enforceable by the
 
03:20:02.710 --> 03:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
landlord so that the tenant basically
 
03:20:04.870 --> 03:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
can stay there as long as the tenant
 
03:20:07.550 --> 03:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
wants it doesn't make any sense if any
 
03:20:09.950 --> 03:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
sense frankly it's an embarrassment to
 
03:20:13.110 --> 03:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
basic principles of contract law I would
 
03:20:18.030 --> 03:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
note here that we passed hb1 11:15
 
03:20:21.189 --> 03:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
earlier this year on a Division vote of
 
03:20:25.590 --> 03:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
194 to 180 so it's very clear that the
 
03:20:29.030 --> 03:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
bill had bipartisan
 
03:20:31.710 --> 03:20:31.720 align:start position:0%
support the other body didn't agree with
 
03:20:34.510 --> 03:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
the House's position and sent HB 1115 to
 
03:20:38.189 --> 03:20:38.199 align:start position:0%
interim study sending this bill back to
 
03:20:41.030 --> 03:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
the other body with with the amendment
 
03:20:44.309 --> 03:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh including 1115 attached will make it
 
03:20:46.830 --> 03:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
clear to the other body how important we
 
03:20:50.429 --> 03:20:50.439 align:start position:0%
think it is for basic common sense and
 
03:20:52.910 --> 03:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
basic contract principles to be restored
 
03:20:56.870 --> 03:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
to law to landlord tenant law when faced
 
03:20:59.429 --> 03:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
with the choice of losing the P bill
 
03:21:02.710 --> 03:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
which the other body wants very badly or
 
03:21:04.630 --> 03:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
accepting the principle that a lease
 
03:21:07.510 --> 03:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
contract should mean what it says I
 
03:21:09.269 --> 03:21:09.279 align:start position:0%
think we can be confident that the other
 
03:21:12.189 --> 03:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
body will see the light and accept our
 
03:21:14.229 --> 03:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment or at least ask for a
 
03:21:16.189 --> 03:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
committee of conference for these
 
03:21:18.150 --> 03:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
reasons I urge you to support the
 
03:21:20.269 --> 03:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
amendment and Mr Speaker I would ask for
 
03:21:21.790 --> 03:21:21.800 align:start position:0%
a division vote thank
 
03:21:24.670 --> 03:21:24.680 align:start position:0%
you repr stab has asked for a roll call
 
03:21:27.150 --> 03:21:27.160 align:start position:0%
is that sufficiently
 
03:21:29.510 --> 03:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
seconded it is sufficiently seconded
 
03:21:31.269 --> 03:21:31.279 align:start position:0%

03:37:05.830 --> 03:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
stab there STS waves
 
03:37:17.150 --> 03:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:21.349 --> 03:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Amendment 1698 H is
 
03:37:24.429 --> 03:37:24.439 align:start position:0%
effectively the same as
 
03:37:29.469 --> 03:37:29.479 align:start position:0%
s422 with uh Amendment 1697 that our
 
03:37:33.670 --> 03:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
body um just approved by a wide margin
 
03:37:35.830 --> 03:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh but with the text of two unrelated
 
03:37:39.950 --> 03:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
bills um in it which do not enjoy such
 
03:37:43.189 --> 03:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
wide support uh one uh essentially is
 
03:37:47.070 --> 03:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
moot at this point uh HB 11:15 because
 
03:37:50.110 --> 03:37:50.120 align:start position:0%
it was incorporated into the previous
 
03:37:53.910 --> 03:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
bill that we just um voted up with that
 
03:37:56.750 --> 03:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment um the
 
03:38:02.750 --> 03:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
other Bill uh is HB 1412 relative to
 
03:38:06.030 --> 03:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
licensing of court reporters um that was
 
03:38:09.309 --> 03:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
also added uh also an unrelated bill
 
03:38:10.790 --> 03:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
that came to the floor with no
 
03:38:13.070 --> 03:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation from our Judiciary
 
03:38:15.469 --> 03:38:15.479 align:start position:0%
Committee and was unanimously recom
 
03:38:18.349 --> 03:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
amended for itl by the body behind the
 
03:38:21.710 --> 03:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
wall behind me
 
03:38:26.189 --> 03:38:26.199 align:start position:0%
um there was no stated um opposition to
 
03:38:28.189 --> 03:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
the continued licensing of court
 
03:38:30.269 --> 03:38:30.279 align:start position:0%
reporters uh during our committee
 
03:38:32.349 --> 03:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
hearings everyone who's covered by the
 
03:38:35.550 --> 03:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
licensing uh even though they had to pay
 
03:38:38.429 --> 03:38:38.439 align:start position:0%
and go through requirements continued to
 
03:38:41.309 --> 03:38:41.319 align:start position:0%
um push to maintain that licensing
 
03:38:43.750 --> 03:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
provision so hope that we would keep
 
03:38:46.990 --> 03:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
that um so I will say the body uh also
 
03:38:49.269 --> 03:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
behind the wall behind me um has a habit
 
03:38:51.269 --> 03:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
of sending us back bills that we support
 
03:38:53.590 --> 03:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
loaded with unrelated Provisions with
 
03:38:56.510 --> 03:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
less support in this uh chamber uh
 
03:38:59.189 --> 03:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
that's not an approach that um I feel we
 
03:39:01.229 --> 03:39:01.239 align:start position:0%
should embrace here in the house I'd
 
03:39:04.349 --> 03:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
like uh to allow us to pass this bill
 
03:39:06.110 --> 03:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
cleanly with the content that we
 
03:39:09.030 --> 03:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
basically all agree on I believe uh urge
 
03:39:10.950 --> 03:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
the members of this body to vote no on
 
03:39:10.960 --> 03:39:12.750 align:start position:0%
the members of this body to vote no on
this

03:39:12.750 --> 03:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:39:14.830 --> 03:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
amendment I ask for recogniz
 
03:39:14.840 --> 03:39:18.189 align:start position:0%
amendment I ask for recogniz
representative

03:39:18.189 --> 03:39:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:20.750 --> 03:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
alander thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
03:39:24.469 --> 03:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
I rise in favor of amendment 20246 98h
 
03:39:26.710 --> 03:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
this simple amendment is a carbon copy
 
03:39:28.349 --> 03:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
of the amendment the house just passed
 
03:39:30.630 --> 03:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
and adds two simple bills to reassert
 
03:39:32.790 --> 03:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
our house position the first bill would
 
03:39:34.429 --> 03:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
help alleviate the housing crisis by
 
03:39:35.990 --> 03:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
adding more flexibility in the housing
 
03:39:39.870 --> 03:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
market the House pass HB 11115 would
 
03:39:41.309 --> 03:39:41.319 align:start position:0%
enable landlord and tenants to have
 
03:39:42.950 --> 03:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
creative conversations about lease
 
03:39:44.870 --> 03:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
agreements this amendment would reward
 
03:39:46.630 --> 03:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
good behavior from tenants and penalize
 
03:39:49.110 --> 03:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
bad behavior additionally this amendment
 
03:39:52.309 --> 03:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
would add hb1 1412 which repeals court
 
03:39:54.950 --> 03:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
reporter certifications this outdated
 
03:39:58.150 --> 03:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
and unneeded certification cost $300 and
 
03:40:00.389 --> 03:40:00.399 align:start position:0%
reputable court reporters already have
 
03:40:02.269 --> 03:40:02.279 align:start position:0%
to be involved in National organizations
 
03:40:04.229 --> 03:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
such as the national court reporters
 
03:40:07.229 --> 03:40:07.239 align:start position:0%
Association in order to receive jobs

03:40:10.469 --> 03:40:10.479 align:start position:0%
underlying bill or not I encourage you
 
03:40:12.550 --> 03:40:12.560 align:start position:0%

03:40:14.189 --> 03:40:14.199 align:start position:0%
send a message to the body on the other
 
03:40:15.870 --> 03:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
side of the wall that the house would
 
03:40:17.349 --> 03:40:17.359 align:start position:0%

Declaration of parentage of a child born
 
03:41:46.269 --> 03:41:46.279 align:start position:0%
to an unmarried couple is one of the
 
03:41:48.110 --> 03:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
most meaningful acts that one can
 
03:41:50.309 --> 03:41:50.319 align:start position:0%

responsibilities for raising that child
 
03:41:56.429 --> 03:41:56.439 align:start position:0%

non-birth parent is not a male and if I
 
03:42:15.950 --> 03:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
know that this bill doesn't change who
 
03:42:18.189 --> 03:42:18.199 align:start position:0%
can be a parent in New Hampshire but
 
03:42:20.710 --> 03:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
rather who can legally declare their
 
03:42:22.830 --> 03:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
parentage without going through a formal
 
03:42:26.110 --> 03:42:26.120 align:start position:0%
adoption procedure in court then would I

know that adding this this amendment
 
03:43:15.389 --> 03:43:15.399 align:start position:0%

is simply not ready for prime time and

the most efficient way to deal with it
 
03:50:59.429 --> 03:50:59.439 align:start position:0%

brief I was reading the blurb the other
 
03:53:43.630 --> 03:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
day and it talks about whether this is
 
03:53:46.309 --> 03:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
going to have an impact on insurance
 
03:53:48.269 --> 03:53:48.279 align:start position:0%
premiums or
 
03:53:50.510 --> 03:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
not as someone who served on the
 
03:53:52.870 --> 03:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
insurance committee for over 30 years
 
03:53:54.269 --> 03:53:54.279 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of things I can
 
03:53:56.389 --> 03:53:56.399 align:start position:0%
guarantee you and a couple of things
 
03:53:59.389 --> 03:53:59.399 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you have a high probability of
 
03:54:01.510 --> 03:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
happening number
 
03:54:04.309 --> 03:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
one I guarantee
 
03:54:04.319 --> 03:54:06.229 align:start position:0%
one I guarantee
you

03:54:06.229 --> 03:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:54:10.110 --> 03:54:10.120 align:start position:0%
everyone's insurance will be
 
03:54:13.790 --> 03:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
impacted the simple reason being that
 
03:54:15.429 --> 03:54:15.439 align:start position:0%
the person the
 
03:54:17.950 --> 03:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
underwriter who issues your policy who
 
03:54:21.309 --> 03:54:21.319 align:start position:0%
is doing setting up your policy cannot
 
03:54:23.149 --> 03:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
ignore these
 
03:54:27.309 --> 03:54:27.319 align:start position:0%
numbers these numbers are off the
 
03:54:29.469 --> 03:54:29.479 align:start position:0%
chart and I would say that if it had
 
03:54:31.229 --> 03:54:31.239 align:start position:0%
gone to a different committee they would
 
03:54:34.469 --> 03:54:34.479 align:start position:0%
have come back with much more reasonable
 
03:54:37.790 --> 03:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
numbers but it didn't I'm not I'm very
 
03:54:39.389 --> 03:54:39.399 align:start position:0%
respectful for other committees and what
 
03:54:42.389 --> 03:54:42.399 align:start position:0%
their work but in this case these
 
03:54:47.229 --> 03:54:47.239 align:start position:0%
numbers are way way way too
 
03:54:51.790 --> 03:54:51.800 align:start position:0%
high I guarantee you everyone who has an
 
03:54:55.429 --> 03:54:55.439 align:start position:0%
insurance policy will see an
 
03:55:01.070 --> 03:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:06.429 --> 03:55:06.439 align:start position:0%
business that has a vehicle or heavy
 
03:55:09.790 --> 03:55:09.800 align:start position:0%
equipment is going to see a Whopper of
 
03:55:09.800 --> 03:55:12.149 align:start position:0%
equipment is going to see a Whopper of
an

03:55:12.149 --> 03:55:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:14.309 --> 03:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
increase the only other thing I will
 
03:55:16.510 --> 03:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
will not try to guarantee this but I can
 
03:55:18.429 --> 03:55:18.439 align:start position:0%
promise you
 
03:55:20.990 --> 03:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
this there will be some insurance
 
03:55:24.349 --> 03:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
companies that will pull out of this
 
03:55:27.110 --> 03:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
state if we pass these
 
03:55:30.309 --> 03:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
numbers stay far and pulled out of
 
03:55:32.990 --> 03:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
California insurance we have a very
 
03:55:36.429 --> 03:55:36.439 align:start position:0%
Lively Insurance market and the last
 
03:55:39.149 --> 03:55:39.159 align:start position:0%
thing we need to do is up that upset
 
03:55:43.389 --> 03:55:43.399 align:start position:0%
that cart with these outrageous numbers
 
03:55:46.550 --> 03:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
please do not pass this bill put it in
 
03:55:49.710 --> 03:55:49.720 align:start position:0%

03:55:51.630 --> 03:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
sure that the department does an
 
03:55:54.269 --> 03:55:54.279 align:start position:0%
Actuarial study and give us numbers that
 
03:55:59.110 --> 03:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
really make sense please vote

03:58:17.790 --> 03:58:17.800 align:start position:0%

country Vermont and Maine have no caps
 
03:58:28.110 --> 03:58:28.120 align:start position:0%
Main's was just injested for inflation
 
03:58:33.349 --> 03:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
in 2003 to $1 million cap Rhode Island
 
03:58:37.630 --> 03:58:37.640 align:start position:0%
raised its cap to 3,5
 
03:58:42.429 --> 03:58:42.439 align:start position:0%
350,000 in 2003 as well our cap has not
 
03:58:46.269 --> 03:58:46.279 align:start position:0%
been adjusted in 20 5 years inflation
 
03:58:49.110 --> 03:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
alone would bring it up to
 
03:58:51.750 --> 03:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
300,000 but let's bring it up so that we
 
03:58:54.429 --> 03:58:54.439 align:start position:0%
don't have to bring this up again yet
 
03:58:56.750 --> 03:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire insurance companies are
 
03:59:00.710 --> 03:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
making record profits the top 10
 
03:59:03.550 --> 03:59:03.560 align:start position:0%
casualty companies in the state had an
 
03:59:06.469 --> 03:59:06.479 align:start position:0%
average loss ratio of
 
03:59:12.269 --> 03:59:12.279 align:start position:0%
56% meaning payout of only 56 cents on
 
03:59:15.710 --> 03:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
every premium dollar that they take in
 
03:59:17.990 --> 03:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
insurance companies have doubled their
 
03:59:21.870 --> 03:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
profits since 2022 to
 
03:59:26.469 --> 03:59:26.479 align:start position:0%
2023 yet a mother who is not working who

does not have a degree who is killed
 
03:59:33.149 --> 03:59:33.159 align:start position:0%

chair oh Mr
 
04:01:07.269 --> 04:01:07.279 align:start position:0%
speaker thank you Mr
 
04:01:10.189 --> 04:01:10.199 align:start position:0%
Speaker this is an interesting Bill we
 
04:01:12.990 --> 04:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
spent two and a half hours listening to
 
04:01:13.000 --> 04:01:14.469 align:start position:0%
spent two and a half hours listening to
uh

04:01:14.469 --> 04:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:01:17.429 --> 04:01:17.439 align:start position:0%
uh everyone say well we don't know if
 
04:01:21.189 --> 04:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
this is too much to raise the the the uh
 
04:01:25.149 --> 04:01:25.159 align:start position:0%
cap or if if the uh raising the cap
 
04:01:27.910 --> 04:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
would raise the insurance rates this
 
04:01:31.229 --> 04:01:31.239 align:start position:0%
bill originally was determined to be uh
 
04:01:34.710 --> 04:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
sent to interim study I think that if we
 
04:01:36.349 --> 04:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
couldn't figure out what was going on in
 
04:01:39.830 --> 04:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
two and a half hours then uh sending to
 
04:01:42.070 --> 04:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
interim study would give us a chance to
 
04:01:45.030 --> 04:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
figure out which
 
04:01:47.110 --> 04:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
the proper amount should be for the cap
 
04:01:50.950 --> 04:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
on wrongful death for loss of Consortium
 
04:01:54.309 --> 04:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
and possibly get an actuarium study so
 
04:01:56.269 --> 04:01:56.279 align:start position:0%
that we could find out what would
 
04:01:59.229 --> 04:01:59.239 align:start position:0%
actually happen to the uh
 
04:02:02.469 --> 04:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
uh uh insurance rates
 
04:02:07.189 --> 04:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
so I ask you to vote red to fail the OTP
 
04:02:07.199 --> 04:02:08.269 align:start position:0%
so I ask you to vote red to fail the OTP
thank

04:02:08.269 --> 04:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:02:19.030 --> 04:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:22.070 --> 04:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker the
 
04:02:23.750 --> 04:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire places a cap on
 
04:02:26.269 --> 04:02:26.279 align:start position:0%
insurance claims for loss of Consortium
 
04:02:27.990 --> 04:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
due to the wrongful death of a spouse
 
04:02:30.670 --> 04:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
parent or child these claims arise
 
04:02:32.830 --> 04:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
through a deceased person's estate where
 
04:02:35.389 --> 04:02:35.399 align:start position:0%
its administrator can bring claims that
 
04:02:37.790 --> 04:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
due to the negligence of another this
 
04:02:40.110 --> 04:02:40.120 align:start position:0%
close family relationship was severed
 
04:02:42.389 --> 04:02:42.399 align:start position:0%
and the spouse child or parent should be
 
04:02:43.590 --> 04:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
compensated for the loss of that
 
04:02:43.600 --> 04:02:44.670 align:start position:0%
compensated for the loss of that
relation

04:02:44.670 --> 04:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
relation
 
04:02:47.389 --> 04:02:47.399 align:start position:0%
relationship as a state we value the
 
04:02:50.309 --> 04:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
loss of a spouse at
 
04:02:52.269 --> 04:02:52.279 align:start position:0%
$150,000 and only
 
04:02:55.110 --> 04:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
$50,000 for a parent or
 
04:02:58.389 --> 04:02:58.399 align:start position:0%
child if those values sound low it may
 
04:02:59.590 --> 04:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
be due to the fact that they haven't
 
04:03:01.269 --> 04:03:01.279 align:start position:0%
been adjusted since they were instated
 
04:03:03.910 --> 04:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
in the late '90s the change that s SP
 
04:03:06.830 --> 04:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
462 proposes is a more than reasonable
 
04:03:09.429 --> 04:03:09.439 align:start position:0%
limit of $500,000 for the loss of a
 
04:03:12.550 --> 04:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
spouse and a three $300,000 limit for
 
04:03:15.950 --> 04:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
the loss of a parent or
 
04:03:18.469 --> 04:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
child and those numbers represent a
 
04:03:20.189 --> 04:03:20.199 align:start position:0%
compromise within the other legislative
 
04:03:22.229 --> 04:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
body with the original version of the
 
04:03:25.110 --> 04:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
bill propose proposing an elimination of
 
04:03:25.120 --> 04:03:26.990 align:start position:0%
bill propose proposing an elimination of
those

04:03:26.990 --> 04:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:03:29.309 --> 04:03:29.319 align:start position:0%
caps removing the limit on loss of
 
04:03:31.429 --> 04:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
Consortium damages alt together may
 
04:03:33.910 --> 04:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
sound like a big step but we don't have
 
04:03:35.349 --> 04:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
to look outside of New England for
 
04:03:37.830 --> 04:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
examples of what happens when these
 
04:03:39.910 --> 04:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
completely arbitrary caps are
 
04:03:43.870 --> 04:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
removed the answer is nothing insurance
 
04:03:46.349 --> 04:03:46.359 align:start position:0%
is no less affordable in the absence of
 
04:03:48.950 --> 04:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
these limits the only other state in New
 
04:03:50.750 --> 04:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
England that even has these limits is
 
04:03:52.710 --> 04:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
Maine and their cap on loss of
 
04:03:54.910 --> 04:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
Consortium damages is a million
 
04:03:57.309 --> 04:03:57.319 align:start position:0%
dollars the people in those States
 
04:03:59.229 --> 04:03:59.239 align:start position:0%
continue to have insurance and the
 
04:04:01.429 --> 04:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
insurance companies haven't
 
04:04:03.670 --> 04:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
left and why is
 
04:04:06.870 --> 04:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
that these types of claims aren't common
 
04:04:08.429 --> 04:04:08.439 align:start position:0%
and they're not common because they're
 
04:04:10.870 --> 04:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
expensive to litigate when they do
 
04:04:13.429 --> 04:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
happen New Hampshire jurries don't give
 
04:04:16.149 --> 04:04:16.159 align:start position:0%
EX excessive verdicts which we know
 
04:04:18.309 --> 04:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
because UNCA damages exist for other
 
04:04:20.510 --> 04:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
claims in New Hampshire and there are no
 
04:04:22.630 --> 04:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
numbers to show that excessive verdicts
 
04:04:25.670 --> 04:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
occur in those circumstances with any
 
04:04:28.389 --> 04:04:28.399 align:start position:0%
frequency not only that judges have the
 
04:04:30.030 --> 04:04:30.040 align:start position:0%
power to reduce excessive monetary
 
04:04:32.349 --> 04:04:32.359 align:start position:0%
verdicts if one were to
 
04:04:34.590 --> 04:04:34.600 align:start position:0%
occur and although we aren't voting on
 
04:04:37.189 --> 04:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
an unlimited cap on Damages for loss of
 
04:04:38.790 --> 04:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
Consortium due to the negligent
 
04:04:41.630 --> 04:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
causation of death we should consider
 
04:04:43.910 --> 04:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
that in New Hampshire damages are
 
04:04:47.750 --> 04:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
uncapped for certain types of negligent
 
04:04:50.710 --> 04:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
injury we are quite literally saying
 
04:04:52.229 --> 04:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
there are some things in life that are
 
04:04:54.990 --> 04:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
worse than death but it's not the loss
 
04:04:57.429 --> 04:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
of a spouse parent or
 
04:04:59.750 --> 04:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
child this is a weighty issue and the
 
04:05:01.469 --> 04:05:01.479 align:start position:0%
types of families that would rely on
 
04:05:04.550 --> 04:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
this RSA and the change that s SP 462
 
04:05:06.950 --> 04:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
would make to it need
 
04:05:09.269 --> 04:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
this they've lost their spouse their
 
04:05:11.870 --> 04:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
parent or their child and our laws have
 
04:05:14.710 --> 04:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
defined a completely inadequate value of
 
04:05:17.030 --> 04:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
a relationship that will never exist
 
04:05:19.309 --> 04:05:19.319 align:start position:0%

04:05:21.990 --> 04:05:22.000 align:start position:0%

Senate Bill
 
04:06:38.550 --> 04:06:38.560 align:start position:0%

04:06:45.950 --> 04:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:48.510 --> 04:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
04:06:50.510 --> 04:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
know that the increase in loss of
 
04:06:53.790 --> 04:06:53.800 align:start position:0%
Consortium caps in this bill are far
 
04:06:56.070 --> 04:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
above what the Caps would be if a mere
 
04:06:59.229 --> 04:06:59.239 align:start position:0%
inflation or Consumer Price Index were
 
04:07:01.469 --> 04:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
applied to the original caps as enacted
 
04:07:04.269 --> 04:07:04.279 align:start position:0%
in the late 1990s and if I know that
 
04:07:06.750 --> 04:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is opposed by the insurance
 
04:07:09.149 --> 04:07:09.159 align:start position:0%
industry the New Hampshire Hospital
 
04:07:10.950 --> 04:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
Association the New Hampshire
 
04:07:14.349 --> 04:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
Association of counties and perhaps most
 
04:07:16.349 --> 04:07:16.359 align:start position:0%
significantly the New Hampshire
 
04:07:18.750 --> 04:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
insurance department and if I know that
 
04:07:21.469 --> 04:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
the basis of these groups opposition is
 
04:07:23.790 --> 04:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
the concern that the damage caps will
 
04:07:26.070 --> 04:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
have the increase in damage caps will
 
04:07:28.070 --> 04:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
have on insurance rates which are
 
04:07:30.590 --> 04:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
already under great stress and more
 
04:07:32.550 --> 04:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
importantly on the availability of
 
04:07:34.950 --> 04:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
insurance for certain critical uh
 
04:07:36.990 --> 04:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
professions such as doctors and other
 
04:07:40.229 --> 04:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
medical professionals and finally if I
 
04:07:42.469 --> 04:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
know that much of these concerns could
 
04:07:44.469 --> 04:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
be eliminated if the insurance
 
04:07:46.510 --> 04:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
department is given time to conduct an
 
04:07:50.950 --> 04:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
Actuarial study of this proposal and and
 
04:07:54.229 --> 04:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
that that we have no indication that 11
 
04:07:56.990 --> 04:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
weeks would be an would be a sufficient
 
04:07:59.790 --> 04:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
time to conduct such a study or that
 
04:08:01.790 --> 04:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
back in February the insurance
 
04:08:03.950 --> 04:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
department was simply able to drop
 
04:08:06.710 --> 04:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
everything to start one right away then
 
04:08:10.830 --> 04:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
would I oppose the OTP motion so that a
 
04:08:13.269 --> 04:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
motion for interim study can be made and
 
04:08:15.950 --> 04:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
the proposal can be brought back next
 
04:08:20.990 --> 04:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:23.189 --> 04:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
Speaker jerich and ie representative
 
04:08:27.389 --> 04:08:27.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:29.870 --> 04:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
04:08:33.389 --> 04:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that I agree
 
04:08:36.790 --> 04:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
completely with the chair of the
 
04:08:40.189 --> 04:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee when he talks about
 
04:08:44.790 --> 04:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
the fact that for some reason reason the
 
04:08:48.510 --> 04:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
department of insurance has been unable
 
04:08:52.950 --> 04:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
or unwilling to give us the data that
 
04:08:55.910 --> 04:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
could help inform us on what would
 
04:08:59.750 --> 04:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
happen in New Hampshire but if I also
 
04:09:04.149 --> 04:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
know that without New Hampshire figures
 
04:09:06.950 --> 04:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
we would best look at what happens in
 
04:09:12.229 --> 04:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
all the other states that have uh raised
 
04:09:16.950 --> 04:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
their limits and found that in no other
 
04:09:22.189 --> 04:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
state has there been an increase in
 
04:09:28.550 --> 04:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
rates if I know that the rates in um all
 
04:09:32.950 --> 04:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
other states in New England uh H have no
 
04:09:36.830 --> 04:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
cap except for Maine where the value has
 
04:09:40.910 --> 04:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
gone up and where there has been no
 
04:09:46.109 --> 04:09:46.119 align:start position:0%
increase in rates and if I also know
 
04:09:51.550 --> 04:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
that because I value a successful um
 
04:09:54.149 --> 04:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
capitalist system I'm pleased to be able
 
04:09:57.630 --> 04:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
to report that insurers in New Hampshire
 
04:09:59.590 --> 04:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
are doing very
 
04:10:04.229 --> 04:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
well um could I now bring myself to
 
04:10:07.990 --> 04:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
recognize that in order to be respectful
 
04:10:09.349 --> 04:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:10:12.229 --> 04:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
families in New Hampshire who find
 
04:10:13.990 --> 04:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
themselves in this
 
04:10:17.429 --> 04:10:17.439 align:start position:0%
situation that I would vote in fact to
 
04:10:20.750 --> 04:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
increase the Caps put us in line with
 
04:10:23.109 --> 04:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
all of the other states that have done
 
04:10:27.309 --> 04:10:27.319 align:start position:0%
this without facing any situation with
 
04:10:30.630 --> 04:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
the sky falling and therefore vote ought
 
04:10:32.750 --> 04:10:32.760 align:start position:0%

cases consider the same report the same
 
04:12:23.149 --> 04:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
with the recommendation that the bill be
 
04:12:24.590 --> 04:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
referred for interim
 
04:12:26.990 --> 04:12:27.000 align:start position:0%

with a recommendation that the bill

thank you Mr Speaker I Rise to speak
 
04:12:59.550 --> 04:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
against the motion of vendim study on
 
04:13:03.189 --> 04:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
this bill currently a criminal defendant
 
04:13:05.590 --> 04:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
may not challenge a conviction after
 
04:13:09.389 --> 04:13:09.399 align:start position:0%
three years for any reason this bill
 
04:13:11.590 --> 04:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
provides a narrow exception from the
 
04:13:14.990 --> 04:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
three-year cap on filing a motion for a
 
04:13:19.670 --> 04:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
new trial the conditions are if but only
 
04:13:23.229 --> 04:13:23.239 align:start position:0%
if there's newly discovered evidence new
 
04:13:26.550 --> 04:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
or additional forensic testing or new
 
04:13:28.670 --> 04:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
scientific understanding that would have
 
04:13:31.469 --> 04:13:31.479 align:start position:0%
been material for the
 
04:13:34.030 --> 04:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
FactFinder if all the evidence was
 
04:13:36.590 --> 04:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
available at the time of trial and there
 
04:13:39.830 --> 04:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
is no new forensic testing available or
 
04:13:43.109 --> 04:13:43.119 align:start position:0%
no new scientific understanding then the
 
04:13:46.229 --> 04:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
three year cap still
 
04:13:48.830 --> 04:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
applies you will hear questions about
 
04:13:51.670 --> 04:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
whether habius Corpus is applicable in
 
04:13:55.189 --> 04:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
these cases habus Corpus which is known
 
04:13:58.349 --> 04:13:58.359 align:start position:0%
as the great RIT dates back to the Magna
 
04:14:02.429 --> 04:14:02.439 align:start position:0%
Carta it literally means let us have the
 
04:14:05.309 --> 04:14:05.319 align:start position:0%
body it is a Judicial command to the
 
04:14:08.389 --> 04:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
Jailer to bring the prisoner before the
 
04:14:12.030 --> 04:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
Court habus Corpus is not available
 
04:14:14.830 --> 04:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
unless the defendant is imprisoned or
 
04:14:17.790 --> 04:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
subject to limitations on his Liberty
 
04:14:20.429 --> 04:14:20.439 align:start position:0%
such as parole or
 
04:14:23.990 --> 04:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
probation this bill is broader than hius
 
04:14:26.870 --> 04:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
Corpus it applies to defendants both
 
04:14:29.429 --> 04:14:29.439 align:start position:0%
imprisoned and those whose Liberty have
 
04:14:29.439 --> 04:14:31.950 align:start position:0%
imprisoned and those whose Liberty have
been

04:14:31.950 --> 04:14:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:35.389 --> 04:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
restricted habius Corpus is not sub is
 
04:14:37.790 --> 04:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
not a subject of this bill and it would
 
04:14:40.550 --> 04:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
not be proper to include it in interim
 
04:14:43.670 --> 04:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
study habius Corpus should be left to
 
04:14:43.680 --> 04:14:45.630 align:start position:0%
study habius Corpus should be left to
Future

04:14:45.630 --> 04:14:45.640 align:start position:0%
Future
 
04:14:48.229 --> 04:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
legislation you will also hear concerns
 
04:14:51.630 --> 04:14:51.640 align:start position:0%
about the application of the DNA statute
 
04:14:53.990 --> 04:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
once again that statute is only
 
04:14:55.790 --> 04:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
available to defendants who are
 
04:14:57.870 --> 04:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
imprisoned or who have other
 
04:15:00.750 --> 04:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
restrictions on their Liberty and it is
 
04:15:03.030 --> 04:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
only applicable in cases in which
 
04:15:06.030 --> 04:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
biological material that can be tested
 
04:15:08.750 --> 04:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
for DNA is
 
04:15:11.550 --> 04:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
available there are cases in which there
 
04:15:13.830 --> 04:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
is no DNA
 
04:15:17.389 --> 04:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
DNA material no biological material that
 
04:15:21.070 --> 04:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
can be tested if the DNA statute is
 
04:15:24.030 --> 04:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
applicable then the courts will apply
 
04:15:27.030 --> 04:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
it finally you will hear concerns about
 
04:15:29.790 --> 04:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
criminal defendants potentially filing
 
04:15:33.469 --> 04:15:33.479 align:start position:0%
repeated motions for a new trial however
 
04:15:36.189 --> 04:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
our Superior Court judges are very
 
04:15:39.349 --> 04:15:39.359 align:start position:0%
capable of reviewing these petitions
 
04:15:41.469 --> 04:15:41.479 align:start position:0%
they will sort out those that have Merit
 
04:15:43.910 --> 04:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
and deserve a hearing from those that
 
04:15:46.590 --> 04:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
have done and should be outright
 
04:15:50.389 --> 04:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
denied remember the law holds that it is
 
04:15:53.189 --> 04:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
better that 10 guilty persons Escape
 
04:15:55.510 --> 04:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
than that one innocent
 
04:15:59.469 --> 04:15:59.479 align:start position:0%
suffer Innocents cannot wait people have
 
04:16:02.349 --> 04:16:02.359 align:start position:0%
been convicted of crimes they did not
 
04:16:05.149 --> 04:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
commit in the narrow circumstances of
 
04:16:07.550 --> 04:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
this bill criminal defendants should
 
04:16:09.830 --> 04:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
have a path forward to prove their
 
04:16:12.590 --> 04:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
innocence please vote no on interim
 
04:16:15.750 --> 04:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
study so that another motion can be made
 
04:16:18.710 --> 04:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I request a division vote
 
04:16:18.720 --> 04:16:20.910 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I request a division vote

04:16:32.750 --> 04:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker this bill
 
04:16:34.349 --> 04:16:34.359 align:start position:0%
would extend the time to petition the
 
04:16:36.510 --> 04:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
court for a new trial from three years
 
04:16:38.510 --> 04:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
to indefinitely for any criminal
 
04:16:40.790 --> 04:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
conviction for a felony offense or Class
 
04:16:44.910 --> 04:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
A misdemeanor if new evidence is
 
04:16:46.950 --> 04:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
discovered of course we don't want an
 
04:16:48.590 --> 04:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
innocent person to be
 
04:16:50.870 --> 04:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
incarcerated however there are already

existing Protections in place such as
 
04:16:55.550 --> 04:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
habius Corpus so there really is no need
 
04:16:57.830 --> 04:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
to rush this law and potentially
 
04:16:59.670 --> 04:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
traumatize victims with frivolous
 
04:17:03.109 --> 04:17:03.119 align:start position:0%
petitions due to the inadequate language
 
04:17:05.229 --> 04:17:05.239 align:start position:0%
this is a very important issue and it is
 
04:17:06.870 --> 04:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
critical that we study it to get the
 
04:17:10.269 --> 04:17:10.279 align:start position:0%
language right the first time as written
 
04:17:12.550 --> 04:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
no parameters exist such as language to
 
04:17:15.149 --> 04:17:15.159 align:start position:0%
address successive petitions on the same
 
04:17:18.189 --> 04:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
grounds nor any outer limit on how soon
 
04:17:19.870 --> 04:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
after new evidence is discovered that
 
04:17:21.870 --> 04:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
one must petition the court
 
04:17:23.389 --> 04:17:23.399 align:start position:0%

correct thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
04:19:53.830 --> 04:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
if I know that this bill would not be
 
04:19:55.950 --> 04:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
granting a new trial based on newly
 
04:19:58.030 --> 04:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
discovered evidence or new scientific
 
04:19:59.750 --> 04:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
understanding and if I know that it
 
04:20:01.910 --> 04:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
would only allow a person to ask for a
 
04:20:03.790 --> 04:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
new trial then wouldn't I oppose the
 
04:20:05.670 --> 04:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
current motion for interim study by
 
04:20:07.349 --> 04:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
pushing the red button so a better
 
04:20:09.670 --> 04:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
motion can be made thank you Mr
 
04:20:11.910 --> 04:20:11.920 align:start position:0%

04:20:19.030 --> 04:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
inir thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if
 
04:20:20.870 --> 04:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
I know that this bill is not ready for
 
04:20:22.710 --> 04:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
prime time because it leaves many
 
04:20:24.950 --> 04:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
important issues unaddressed and if I
 
04:20:26.710 --> 04:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
know that among these issues are the
 
04:20:28.870 --> 04:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
absence of limits on successive motions
 
04:20:31.710 --> 04:20:31.720 align:start position:0%
for new trial raising the same issues
 
04:20:33.710 --> 04:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
the lack of any threshold requirement to
 
04:20:35.710 --> 04:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
make some level of showing that the
 
04:20:38.429 --> 04:20:38.439 align:start position:0%
motion for new trial has has a merit and
 
04:20:41.189 --> 04:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
is likely to succeed and finally if I
 
04:20:43.189 --> 04:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
know that there is no urgency to act
 
04:20:45.070 --> 04:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
immediately to expand the three-year
 
04:20:47.630 --> 04:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
time limit on motions for new trial
 
04:20:50.349 --> 04:20:50.359 align:start position:0%
because in almost not all not all but
 
04:20:53.189 --> 04:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
almost all cases an alternative remedy
 
04:20:54.870 --> 04:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
is available through a petition for rid
 
04:20:57.389 --> 04:20:57.399 align:start position:0%
of avius Corpus then would I support the
 
04:20:59.469 --> 04:20:59.479 align:start position:0%
interim study motion by pressing the
 
04:21:01.790 --> 04:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
green button so that the deficiencies I
 
04:21:03.710 --> 04:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
have noted can be addressed and the bill
 
04:21:06.469 --> 04:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
brought back next year thank you Mr

Amendment 1857 H which can be found in
 
04:22:24.550 --> 04:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
your seat pockets and recognized speak
 
04:22:34.550 --> 04:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:36.710 --> 04:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr
 
04:22:39.510 --> 04:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
Speaker this floor Amendment addresses a
 
04:22:41.590 --> 04:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
few of the issues that were mentioned
 
04:22:45.189 --> 04:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:48.510 --> 04:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
one being that it provides
 
04:22:51.030 --> 04:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
that it can't just be any evidence you
 
04:22:52.710 --> 04:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
have to establish that there would be a
 
04:22:54.229 --> 04:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
reasonable likelihood of a more
 
04:22:58.349 --> 04:22:58.359 align:start position:0%
favorable outcome two it also defines
 
04:23:12.670 --> 04:23:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:14.109 --> 04:23:14.119 align:start position:0%
I think it's
 
04:23:16.870 --> 04:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
important that we're following the right
 
04:23:20.030 --> 04:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
standards for that it also further
 
04:23:23.030 --> 04:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
defines the fact that a court need not
 
04:23:26.590 --> 04:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
entertain a repetitive petition that has
 
04:23:28.590 --> 04:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
already been ruled against the first
 
04:23:31.389 --> 04:23:31.399 align:start position:0%
time otherwise if we don't put this in
 
04:23:33.469 --> 04:23:33.479 align:start position:0%
somebody could literally just keep
 
04:23:35.950 --> 04:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
petitioning the same time over and over
 
04:23:38.149 --> 04:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
again on the same grounds that have
 
04:23:39.950 --> 04:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
already been
 
04:23:42.510 --> 04:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
found against so I think this is a
 
04:23:44.710 --> 04:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
really important amendment that we
 
04:23:46.550 --> 04:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
passed and I ask you all to please vote
 
04:23:48.429 --> 04:23:48.439 align:start position:0%
in favor of it thank
 
04:23:50.670 --> 04:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
you representative margerie Smith
 
04:23:59.670 --> 04:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:04.309 --> 04:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
amendment Mr Speaker I Rise Against um
 
04:24:07.830 --> 04:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
the floor Amendment the floor amendment
 
04:24:10.830 --> 04:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
was never presented to the Judiciary
 
04:24:14.550 --> 04:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
Committee even though we have had this
 
04:24:21.070 --> 04:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:23.550 --> 04:24:23.560 align:start position:0%
me you recognize to speak against the
 
04:24:25.990 --> 04:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment that's what I'm doing is
 
04:24:30.469 --> 04:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
that all good okay thank you I just want
 
04:24:32.710 --> 04:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure I'm doing the right thing I
 
04:24:36.830 --> 04:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
always try to do the right thing um and
 
04:24:36.840 --> 04:24:38.229 align:start position:0%
always try to do the right thing um and
mostly

04:24:38.229 --> 04:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
mostly
 
04:24:41.870 --> 04:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
succeed um the amendment the floor
 
04:24:44.550 --> 04:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment was never presented to the
 
04:24:47.229 --> 04:24:47.239 align:start position:0%
members of the Judiciary Committee even
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
though we have had this bill for quite a
 
04:24:52.710 --> 04:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
while it was never reviewed by us it was
 
04:24:55.429 --> 04:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
never evaluated by the committee and we
 
04:24:58.349 --> 04:24:58.359 align:start position:0%
in this legislature like to rely on
 
04:25:00.429 --> 04:25:00.439 align:start position:0%
committees to do the heavy
 
04:25:03.870 --> 04:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
lifting uh the changes that the floor
 
04:25:05.710 --> 04:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
amendment has
 
04:25:11.710 --> 04:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
included um seem to confuse rather than
 
04:25:11.720 --> 04:25:12.950 align:start position:0%
included um seem to confuse rather than
clarify

04:25:12.950 --> 04:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
04:25:17.510 --> 04:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
issues for example it refers to DNA and
 
04:25:20.630 --> 04:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
yet while DNA is important it is by no
 
04:25:24.189 --> 04:25:24.199 align:start position:0%
means the only set of circumstances that
 
04:25:27.670 --> 04:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
could change um over time and where it
 
04:25:30.309 --> 04:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
might be appropriate in order to make
 
04:25:33.510 --> 04:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
sure that the right decisions are made
 
04:25:39.070 --> 04:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
to consider other factors all of this um
 
04:25:41.950 --> 04:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
uh is I think important but what strikes
 
04:25:45.870 --> 04:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
me most is the language in the amendment
 
04:25:48.670 --> 04:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
which seems to think that the judicial
 
04:25:52.229 --> 04:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
branch is not on its own capable of
 
04:25:56.030 --> 04:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
determining how to process petitions
 
04:25:58.950 --> 04:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
that come to the court and that the
 
04:26:02.309 --> 04:26:02.319 align:start position:0%
legislature should interfere with how
 
04:26:04.950 --> 04:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch processes those
 
04:26:08.590 --> 04:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
cases I'm sure that the amendment was
 
04:26:11.590 --> 04:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
well-meaning but I don't think it helps
 
04:26:15.109 --> 04:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
us achieve the goals that this committee
 
04:26:17.710 --> 04:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
this legislature has just indicated that
 
04:26:21.070 --> 04:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
it has some support for so I ask you to
 
04:26:24.750 --> 04:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
vote down the floor Amendment so that we
 
04:26:28.790 --> 04:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
can then Vote or to pass on the bill
 
04:26:32.710 --> 04:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:35.429 --> 04:26:35.439 align:start position:0%
Speaker the questions on the adoption of
 
04:26:39.030 --> 04:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment 1857 H ready for the
 
04:26:40.990 --> 04:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
question thought so this will be a
 
04:27:41.109 --> 04:27:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:29.030 --> 04:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:30.469 --> 04:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
the questions on the adoption of floor
 
04:28:33.790 --> 04:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1857 H representative Ming is
 
04:28:39.229 --> 04:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:41.870 --> 04:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
04:28:43.590 --> 04:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
if if I know that the floor Amendment
 
04:28:45.550 --> 04:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
will create a more burdensome standard
 
04:28:47.870 --> 04:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
for simply asking for a new trial based
 
04:28:49.550 --> 04:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
on newly discovered evidence or a new
 
04:28:51.590 --> 04:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
scientific understanding then wouldn't I
 
04:28:53.189 --> 04:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
oppose the floor amendment by pushing
 
04:28:56.309 --> 04:28:56.319 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
04:29:07.149 --> 04:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
if if I know that the amendment here
 
04:29:09.469 --> 04:29:09.479 align:start position:0%
corrects a number of the deficiencies in
 
04:29:12.309 --> 04:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
the bill that we that were previously uh
 
04:29:14.670 --> 04:29:14.680 align:start position:0%
referenced would I then support this

Speaker it is often said that we can be
 
04:33:27.990 --> 04:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
assured of two things death and
 
04:33:30.510 --> 04:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
taxes it is the former topic on which I
 
04:33:34.830 --> 04:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
speak today sp sp 567 has to do with the
 
04:33:37.230 --> 04:33:37.240 align:start position:0%
somber subject of someone who has passed
 
04:33:39.551 --> 04:33:39.561 align:start position:0%
away in other words someone who is no
 
04:33:42.470 --> 04:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
more has ceased to be and is Rift of
 
04:33:45.230 --> 04:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
Life current legislation requires that
 
04:33:47.390 --> 04:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
when the city or town receives an
 
04:33:49.310 --> 04:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
official notice of death that the
 
04:33:51.390 --> 04:33:51.400 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist be notified
 
04:33:54.230 --> 04:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
to remove that individual from the voter
 
04:33:57.269 --> 04:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
roles this bill then has the executive
 
04:34:00.230 --> 04:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
or a personal representative notify the
 
04:34:01.670 --> 04:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
local Clerk of the death of an
 
04:34:04.470 --> 04:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
individual 18 years of age and above
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
within a 30-day
 
04:34:08.830 --> 04:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
period if you'll pardon the expression
 
04:34:09.990 --> 04:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
it creates a
 
04:34:12.670 --> 04:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
deadline you may ask ask what about a
 
04:34:15.109 --> 04:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
grieving widow or a relative what if
 
04:34:17.949 --> 04:34:17.959 align:start position:0%
they forget well no penalty is
 
04:34:20.869 --> 04:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
associated with this bill so such an
 
04:34:22.869 --> 04:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
understandable admission would not be
 
04:34:25.510 --> 04:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
punished this bill simply expedites the
 
04:34:27.750 --> 04:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
notification process particularly for
 
04:34:30.189 --> 04:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
lawyers and estate fiduciaries handling
 
04:34:32.910 --> 04:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
such matters this bill helps to keep the
 
04:34:35.029 --> 04:34:35.039 align:start position:0%
voter rules clean it helps with the
 
04:34:37.269 --> 04:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
Integrity of our New Hampshire elections
 
04:34:40.230 --> 04:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
and with voter conf confidence honorable
 
04:34:42.029 --> 04:34:42.039 align:start position:0%
colleagues I'd be grateful for your
 
04:34:47.070 --> 04:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:49.670 --> 04:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
you representative Mark Pages recognizes
 
04:34:53.551 --> 04:34:53.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:56.551 --> 04:34:56.561 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker today I Rise
 
04:34:58.429 --> 04:34:58.439 align:start position:0%
to support the majority recommendation
 
04:35:00.590 --> 04:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
to itl SP
 
04:35:03.551 --> 04:35:03.561 align:start position:0%
576 this bill a bill that would require
 
04:35:05.830 --> 04:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
an executive of an estate to report to
 
04:35:08.109 --> 04:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
the clerk the death of a person within
 
04:35:10.949 --> 04:35:10.959 align:start position:0%
30 days of being appointed as executive
 
04:35:12.949 --> 04:35:12.959 align:start position:0%
is the classic case of a solution
 
04:35:14.269 --> 04:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
searching for a
 
04:35:17.070 --> 04:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
problem don't take it from me though the
 
04:35:18.670 --> 04:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office gave
 
04:35:21.029 --> 04:35:21.039 align:start position:0%
extensive testimony and in fact was the
 
04:35:23.429 --> 04:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
only one to speak to the substance of
 
04:35:25.949 --> 04:35:25.959 align:start position:0%
the bill at the house hearing expressing
 
04:35:28.869 --> 04:35:28.879 align:start position:0%
concerns concluding ultimately the bill
 
04:35:31.189 --> 04:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
was unnecessary for any number of
 
04:35:33.429 --> 04:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
reasons the Department of Health and
 
04:35:36.510 --> 04:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
Human Services town and City Clerks
 
04:35:38.670 --> 04:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
among others share that
 
04:35:41.230 --> 04:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
position first as the Secretary of State
 
04:35:44.310 --> 04:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
reported there's already a robust and
 
04:35:46.551 --> 04:35:46.561 align:start position:0%
thorough coordinated system in place to
 
04:35:49.150 --> 04:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
ensure that a deceased person is timely
 
04:35:52.070 --> 04:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
removed from the voting roles and it's
 
04:35:54.189 --> 04:35:54.199 align:start position:0%
working Secretary of State could not
 
04:35:56.949 --> 04:35:56.959 align:start position:0%
recall a single instance of any problem
 
04:36:00.029 --> 04:36:00.039 align:start position:0%
that the bill would have resolved second
 
04:36:02.349 --> 04:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
as the Secretary of State office also
 
04:36:05.230 --> 04:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
noted existing criminal penalties
 
04:36:07.269 --> 04:36:07.279 align:start position:0%
effectively deter anyone who might
 
04:36:09.150 --> 04:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
consider committing voting fraud voter
 
04:36:11.750 --> 04:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
fraud by requesting an absentee ballot
 
04:36:14.349 --> 04:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
of a deceased person penalties for
 
04:36:16.990 --> 04:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
election interference are quite severe
 
04:36:19.750 --> 04:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
as they should be and they're working
 
04:36:23.070 --> 04:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
and third and finally implementation of
 
04:36:25.830 --> 04:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is unclear the bill does not
 
04:36:28.310 --> 04:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
contain any information about how or who
 
04:36:31.269 --> 04:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
is to notify the executive of this Duty
 
04:36:33.150 --> 04:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
and there's no enforcement
 
04:36:35.750 --> 04:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism not only is the bill a
 
04:36:38.390 --> 04:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
solution in search of a problem but it's
 
04:36:42.551 --> 04:36:42.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:45.750 --> 04:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
those of us Mr Speaker when I die I want
 
04:36:49.830 --> 04:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
to be buried in Chicago so I can keep
 
04:36:53.070 --> 04:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
voting now various Geographic locations
 
04:36:55.390 --> 04:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
have been used and substituted for
 
04:36:59.029 --> 04:36:59.039 align:start position:0%
Chicago like Louisiana and Texas but
 
04:37:00.429 --> 04:37:00.439 align:start position:0%
I've never heard New Hampshire mention
 
04:37:03.429 --> 04:37:03.439 align:start position:0%
in that joke and I know why the current
 
04:37:07.150 --> 04:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
system works and passing s SP 576 would
 
04:37:10.470 --> 04:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
only create a problem not resolve one I
 
04:37:11.990 --> 04:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote in favor favor of the
 
04:37:16.670 --> 04:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:19.750 --> 04:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
Speaker the motion is in expedience to
 
04:37:26.230 --> 04:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:30.189 --> 04:37:30.199 align:start position:0%
576 as the previous speaker will you
 
04:37:32.670 --> 04:37:32.680 align:start position:0%
take a question nope okay he doesn't
 
04:37:36.029 --> 04:37:36.039 align:start position:0%
yield so anyway the Motions in expedient
 
04:37:38.029 --> 04:37:38.039 align:start position:0%
to legislate representative Sweeney
 
04:37:39.390 --> 04:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
requests a roll call is that
 
04:37:42.070 --> 04:37:42.080 align:start position:0%

a

04:39:11.590 --> 04:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:13.230 --> 04:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
questions on the majority committee
 
04:39:14.869 --> 04:39:14.879 align:start position:0%
report have been expedient to legislate
 
04:39:16.910 --> 04:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
and this is a roll call
 
04:39:18.910 --> 04:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
vote representative Wallace is
 
04:39:27.070 --> 04:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:30.510 --> 04:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
04:39:32.510 --> 04:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
if I know that a ricent New Hampshire
 
04:39:35.109 --> 04:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
voter that dies out of state there is no
 
04:39:37.550 --> 04:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
procedure for that person to be removed
 
04:39:40.190 --> 04:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
from the voter checklist and Mr Speaker
 
04:39:41.350 --> 04:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
if I know that there is a proced
 
04:39:43.230 --> 04:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
procedure to remove the decedent from
 
04:39:44.990 --> 04:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
the checklist only if they die in New
 
04:39:47.750 --> 04:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and lastly Mr Speaker if I
 
04:39:49.510 --> 04:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
know that there is no legitimate reason
 
04:39:51.230 --> 04:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
to keep a decedent's name on the voter
 
04:39:53.110 --> 04:39:53.120 align:start position:0%

always happy to have the clerk advise me
 
04:47:35.590 --> 04:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
um I am going to speak against the
 
04:47:38.590 --> 04:47:38.600 align:start position:0%
motion of ought to pass for all the
 
04:47:42.708 --> 04:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
reasons that I have already given you um
 
04:47:45.750 --> 04:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
based on substance but I am going to add
 
04:47:49.788 --> 04:47:49.798 align:start position:0%
one additional comment a statement was
 
04:47:54.510 --> 04:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
made by uh one of our colleagues about a
 
04:47:57.110 --> 04:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
comment that was made
 
04:48:01.590 --> 04:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
casually in the Judiciary Committee in
 
04:48:05.670 --> 04:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
fact the comment said something about of
 
04:48:09.270 --> 04:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
a person having voted and then died
 
04:48:11.510 --> 04:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
before the election
 
04:48:15.788 --> 04:48:15.798 align:start position:0%
in fact that is true a person
 
04:48:22.750 --> 04:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
voted filed the ballot and died and as
 
04:48:26.150 --> 04:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
always happens and is appropriate to
 
04:48:31.150 --> 04:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
happen the clerk of the jurisdiction
 
04:48:35.708 --> 04:48:35.718 align:start position:0%
where that person had resided did not
 
04:48:39.750 --> 04:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
count the ballot because it had been
 
04:48:42.868 --> 04:48:42.878 align:start position:0%
recorded that that person had died the
 
04:48:46.390 --> 04:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
system works to pretend that it doesn't
 
04:48:50.150 --> 04:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
work and to make a fuss about something
 
04:48:53.390 --> 04:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
that isn't accurate isn't helpful and I
 
04:48:56.390 --> 04:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
hope that you will vote against or to
 
04:49:00.948 --> 04:49:00.958 align:start position:0%

clearly not a popular budgetary

need to be provided for some of these
 
04:58:52.990 --> 04:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
can be deferred but eventually they have
 
04:58:56.310 --> 04:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
to be done and the longer the wait the
 
04:58:58.990 --> 04:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
more expensive the job is to
 
04:59:01.830 --> 04:59:01.840 align:start position:0%

mathematical equation to calculate a tax

the change year over year of the

04:59:20.990 --> 04:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
enrollment and I'm sorry and a
 
04:59:22.788 --> 04:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
multiplier for
 
04:59:25.350 --> 04:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
inflation School enrollment enrollment
 
04:59:27.230 --> 04:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
is computed using the department of

school district as of October 1st of of
 
04:59:41.350 --> 04:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
the prior
 
04:59:45.310 --> 04:59:45.320 align:start position:0%
year the CPI is that of January 1st of
 
04:59:49.590 --> 04:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
some undefined year and the same educ
 
04:59:52.830 --> 04:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
equation is used for both the municipal
 
04:59:54.190 --> 04:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
and school
 
04:59:58.270 --> 04:59:58.280 align:start position:0%
budgets or uh sorry with the town
 
05:00:00.868 --> 05:00:00.878 align:start position:0%
population or the student
 
05:00:05.350 --> 05:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
admi are but there's no mechanism for
 
05:00:08.310 --> 05:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
choosing which value value to
 
05:00:11.430 --> 05:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
use the department of Education advises
 
05:00:14.910 --> 05:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
this bill needs to define the admr to be
 
05:00:17.788 --> 05:00:17.798 align:start position:0%
specific as to what grades are covered
 
05:00:19.750 --> 05:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
our education Freedom account
 
05:00:22.628 --> 05:00:22.638 align:start position:0%
participates participants included our
 
05:00:25.990 --> 05:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
students residing residing in one town
 
05:00:28.548 --> 05:00:28.558 align:start position:0%
but tuition to a school in another town
 
05:00:31.390 --> 05:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
included are Charter Schools
 
05:00:33.910 --> 05:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
included are preschools
 
05:00:36.350 --> 05:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
included the Department of Education
 
05:00:38.230 --> 05:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
apparently has different admr
 
05:00:40.750 --> 05:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
calculations for different purposes
 
05:00:43.030 --> 05:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
and is concerned of unintended
 
05:00:45.628 --> 05:00:45.638 align:start position:0%
consequences if other rsas can be
 
05:00:48.310 --> 05:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
avoided by clarifying the choice of the
 
05:00:50.948 --> 05:00:50.958 align:start position:0%
admr definition used
 
05:00:54.030 --> 05:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
here for school budgets unavoidable
 
05:00:55.788 --> 05:00:55.798 align:start position:0%
costs include those mentioned for the
 
05:00:58.590 --> 05:00:58.600 align:start position:0%
municipal budget but add on the cost of
 
05:01:02.390 --> 05:01:02.400 align:start position:0%

by the state federal law and the
 
05:01:15.310 --> 05:01:15.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Education rules so what
 
05:01:17.230 --> 05:01:17.240 align:start position:0%
can be changed if a proposed school
 
05:01:20.708 --> 05:01:20.718 align:start position:0%

tax tying a tax cap to the Consumer
 
05:01:50.910 --> 05:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
Price Index and populations may seem
 
05:01:53.230 --> 05:01:53.240 align:start position:0%
like a logical way to control spending
 
05:01:56.030 --> 05:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
while counting for inflation in good
 
05:01:58.548 --> 05:01:58.558 align:start position:0%
years if populations increase and
 
05:02:01.070 --> 05:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
inflation increases or the calculation
 
05:02:04.350 --> 05:02:04.360 align:start position:0%
reaches a break even Point by adopting
 
05:02:06.190 --> 05:02:06.200 align:start position:0%
the C
 
05:02:08.948 --> 05:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
calculation in this bill it commits
 
05:02:10.390 --> 05:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
towns and schools
 
05:02:12.430 --> 05:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
to contend with the opposite results
 
05:02:15.190 --> 05:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
when a deflation occurs a negative
 
05:02:16.830 --> 05:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
inflation rate is
 
05:02:19.350 --> 05:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
applied during such recessions
 
05:02:22.510 --> 05:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
businesses close people leave lose jobs
 
05:02:24.990 --> 05:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
and leave town to find work but we'll
 
05:02:27.230 --> 05:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
still need to
 
05:02:30.350 --> 05:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
provide the basic Services adequate
 
05:02:32.670 --> 05:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
education and the buildings that house
 
05:02:35.788 --> 05:02:35.798 align:start position:0%
the services we need to maintain at some
 
05:02:38.948 --> 05:02:38.958 align:start position:0%
level another point is that the CPI
 
05:02:41.750 --> 05:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't account for for the cost of fuel
 
05:02:44.190 --> 05:02:44.200 align:start position:0%
or other energy components as these are
 
05:02:44.200 --> 05:02:46.150 align:start position:0%
or other energy components as these are
highly

05:02:46.150 --> 05:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
highly
 
05:02:48.750 --> 05:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
volatile and remember not too long ago
 
05:02:50.310 --> 05:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
when the fuel prices
 
05:02:52.628 --> 05:02:52.638 align:start position:0%
skyrocketed towns struggled to keep
 
05:02:55.788 --> 05:02:55.798 align:start position:0%
Cloud trucks running and schools warm
 
05:02:58.590 --> 05:02:58.600 align:start position:0%
within the budgets that had been passed
 
05:03:00.990 --> 05:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
under this bill's optional calculations
 
05:03:03.548 --> 05:03:03.558 align:start position:0%
and these circumstances local budgets
 
05:03:06.310 --> 05:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
could not sustain the
 
05:03:10.868 --> 05:03:10.878 align:start position:0%
services s SP 383 optional multip is
 
05:03:13.390 --> 05:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
creative but poses a higher risk to
 
05:03:16.230 --> 05:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
towns and schools hedging their bets on
 
05:03:19.230 --> 05:03:19.240 align:start position:0%
populations and cpis that we can't
 
05:03:22.510 --> 05:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
control so Mr Speaker I ask you to join
 
05:03:25.590 --> 05:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
me and the 97% of the state's political
 
05:03:30.990 --> 05:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
sub subdivisions that reject in any form
 
05:03:34.548 --> 05:03:34.558 align:start position:0%
a tax cap and please vote against the
 
05:03:36.830 --> 05:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
motion of ought to pass as amended thank
 
05:03:38.190 --> 05:03:38.200 align:start position:0%

05:03:46.948 --> 05:03:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:50.150 --> 05:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr Speaker I rise in
 
05:03:52.430 --> 05:03:52.440 align:start position:0%

Senate Bill 383 is important enabling
 
05:04:17.190 --> 05:04:17.200 align:start position:0%

school districts with two optional
 
05:04:23.230 --> 05:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
budgetary tools which can be adopted
 
05:04:26.788 --> 05:04:26.798 align:start position:0%
locally and used to better manage local
 
05:04:29.788 --> 05:04:29.798 align:start position:0%
spending in a fiscally responsible
 
05:04:32.830 --> 05:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
manner first this bill adds an
 
05:04:35.750 --> 05:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
adjustment method to the existing local
 
05:04:39.350 --> 05:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
tax cap enabling statute currently the
 
05:04:42.868 --> 05:04:42.878 align:start position:0%
prop proposed tax effort can be capped
 
05:04:45.788 --> 05:04:45.798 align:start position:0%
by either a fixed percentage or a fixed
 
05:04:48.948 --> 05:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
dollar amount this bill adds a third
 
05:04:51.750 --> 05:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
option by which the proposed tax effort
 
05:04:54.708 --> 05:04:54.718 align:start position:0%
can be capped based on both a given
 
05:04:58.150 --> 05:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
annual inflation index and the change in
 
05:05:01.030 --> 05:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
population of the town or the school
 
05:05:03.788 --> 05:05:03.798 align:start position:0%
district where the annual inflation
 
05:05:07.190 --> 05:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
index is one published by the US Bureau
 
05:05:10.948 --> 05:05:10.958 align:start position:0%

reported to the Department of Education
 
05:05:39.190 --> 05:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
notably a three-fifth super majority
 
05:05:42.190 --> 05:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
vote required to either adopt or resend
 
05:05:45.670 --> 05:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
a local tax cap and the ability to
 
05:05:48.990 --> 05:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
override the tax cap each year by a
 
05:05:52.030 --> 05:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
simple majority vote of the legislative
 
05:05:56.510 --> 05:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
body is unchanged by this bill and
 
05:06:00.350 --> 05:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
second this bill also provides for a new
 
05:06:03.868 --> 05:06:03.878 align:start position:0%
optional School District budget cap this
 
05:06:06.590 --> 05:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
new provision is also enabling
 
05:06:09.270 --> 05:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
legislation that establishes an annual
 
05:06:12.788 --> 05:06:12.798 align:start position:0%
cap on proposed spending the School
 
05:06:15.110 --> 05:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
District budget cap is based on a
 
05:06:18.230 --> 05:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
current per per pupil cost times the
 
05:06:20.110 --> 05:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
number of pupils that is the average
 
05:06:22.548 --> 05:06:22.558 align:start position:0%
daily membership in residents where the
 
05:06:26.470 --> 05:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
current pupil cost is adjusted annually
 
05:06:29.510 --> 05:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
based on a selected inflation index
 
05:06:32.270 --> 05:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
again reported by the US Bureau of Labor
 
05:06:35.708 --> 05:06:35.718 align:start position:0%
Statistics or the municipal cost index
 
05:06:38.868 --> 05:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
finally similar to the local tax cap the
 
05:06:42.190 --> 05:06:42.200 align:start position:0%
new School District budget cap is
 
05:06:45.070 --> 05:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
adopted or rescinded by a 3- fifth super
 
05:06:47.830 --> 05:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
majority vote and in each year the
 
05:06:50.070 --> 05:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
School District budget cap can be
 
05:06:53.270 --> 05:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
overridden by a 3- fifths super majority
 
05:06:56.788 --> 05:06:56.798 align:start position:0%
vote of the legislative body to conclude
 
05:07:00.470 --> 05:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 383 is important enabling
 
05:07:03.590 --> 05:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
legislation that provides taxpayers with
 
05:07:06.750 --> 05:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
an additional practical tax effort
 
05:07:09.548 --> 05:07:09.558 align:start position:0%
adjustment method under the existing
 
05:07:13.230 --> 05:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
local tax cap RSA and it establishes a
 
05:07:16.990 --> 05:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
new School District budget cap statute
 
05:07:20.270 --> 05:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
both of which automatically adjust with
 
05:07:23.470 --> 05:07:23.480 align:start position:0%
inflation as well as population changes
 
05:07:26.270 --> 05:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
within the town or the school district
 
05:07:29.230 --> 05:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
encouraging fiscally responsible
 
05:07:32.670 --> 05:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
budgeting and also gives Granite State P
 
05:07:35.470 --> 05:07:35.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers the means by which they can
 
05:07:39.230 --> 05:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
more effectively manage local spending
 
05:07:41.590 --> 05:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
in in an effort to keep local property
 
05:07:45.310 --> 05:07:45.320 align:start position:0%
taxes under control for these reasons I
 
05:07:48.110 --> 05:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
urge my fellow colleagues to support the
 
05:07:50.590 --> 05:07:50.600 align:start position:0%

Bill 383 this is a roll call vote chair
 
05:09:36.350 --> 05:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
recognized representative mangi for a
 
05:09:40.708 --> 05:09:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:43.030 --> 05:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
05:09:47.150 --> 05:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
know this B this bill imposes two State
 
05:09:49.310 --> 05:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
imposed mandates which erode local
 
05:09:53.430 --> 05:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
control to set your local tax caps and
 
05:09:55.910 --> 05:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that the existing
 
05:09:58.910 --> 05:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
Provisions for ex establishing tax caps
 
05:10:00.910 --> 05:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
have not been challenged and therefore
 
05:10:03.470 --> 05:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
adding a confusing option is
 
05:10:05.868 --> 05:10:05.878 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and Mr Speaker if I also
 
05:10:08.708 --> 05:10:08.718 align:start position:0%
know the state imposed formula in this
 
05:10:10.670 --> 05:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
bill for calculating the tax cap
 
05:10:12.788 --> 05:10:12.798 align:start position:0%
requires using the average daily
 
05:10:15.390 --> 05:10:15.400 align:start position:0%
membership in residents but according to
 
05:10:17.548 --> 05:10:17.558 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education there are
 
05:10:20.070 --> 05:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
several definitions of admr and without
 
05:10:22.590 --> 05:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
a clear definition of which to use the
 
05:10:24.990 --> 05:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
formula will not be accurate and there
 
05:10:26.708 --> 05:10:26.718 align:start position:0%
be made there may be unintended
 
05:10:28.990 --> 05:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
consequences for several other sections
 
05:10:31.430 --> 05:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
of law then Mr Speaker would I vote
 
05:10:33.910 --> 05:10:33.920 align:start position:0%

pressing the red button so that another
 
05:10:38.390 --> 05:10:38.400 align:start position:0%

05:10:41.470 --> 05:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
local control for local taxes and local
 
05:10:44.150 --> 05:10:44.160 align:start position:0%

inflation and population changes and if
 
05:11:04.030 --> 05:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
I know that when local spending is
 
05:11:06.750 --> 05:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible that property taxes
 
05:11:09.270 --> 05:11:09.280 align:start position:0%

05:15:37.350 --> 05:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
Coker thank you Mr Speaker so uh this
 
05:15:39.628 --> 05:15:39.638 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment uh 18
 
05:15:44.708 --> 05:15:44.718 align:start position:0%
47 basically adds two bills um that went
 
05:15:45.910 --> 05:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
through this house on a pretty good
 
05:15:48.350 --> 05:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
margin uh to this bill for uh Senate
 
05:15:51.150 --> 05:15:51.160 align:start position:0%
Bill 532 so the first bill is House Bill
 
05:15:53.708 --> 05:15:53.718 align:start position:0%
1391 which allows new vehicles to be
 
05:15:55.510 --> 05:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
inspected in the second year after
 
05:15:57.868 --> 05:15:57.878 align:start position:0%
purchase um I've already gone through
 
05:16:00.510 --> 05:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
the arguments twice uh on this bill in
 
05:16:01.548 --> 05:16:01.558 align:start position:0%
the house I'm just going to hit the
 
05:16:03.390 --> 05:16:03.400 align:start position:0%
bullet points and both times I went
 
05:16:05.270 --> 05:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
through on a pretty good margin uh we
 
05:16:06.868 --> 05:16:06.878 align:start position:0%
can make this change to our inspection
 
05:16:09.670 --> 05:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
laws safely and it's going to save our
 
05:16:11.948 --> 05:16:11.958 align:start position:0%
constituents millions of dollars and
 
05:16:14.788 --> 05:16:14.798 align:start position:0%
it's going to save them 83,000 hours of
 
05:16:17.430 --> 05:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
their time every year on unnecessary um
 
05:16:20.150 --> 05:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
inspections so the second bill is HB
 
05:16:22.270 --> 05:16:22.280 align:start position:0%
1032 which pass the house on a Voice
 
05:16:24.948 --> 05:16:24.958 align:start position:0%
vote and basically what it does is um it
 
05:16:26.750 --> 05:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
grants an exemption for cars that are
 
05:16:28.990 --> 05:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
over um or for titles for cars that are
 
05:16:33.030 --> 05:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
over 20 years old so right now the you
 
05:16:35.510 --> 05:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
get an exemption for a title if the car
 
05:16:35.520 --> 05:16:36.910 align:start position:0%
get an exemption for a title if the car
is

05:16:36.910 --> 05:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:16:41.150 --> 05:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
1999 or um earlier so 1999 was a long
 
05:16:43.190 --> 05:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
time ago and this kind of makes it so
 
05:16:45.470 --> 05:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
it's not like a set thing it it this
 
05:16:48.230 --> 05:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
would basically put a 20-year Mark and
 
05:16:49.708 --> 05:16:49.718 align:start position:0%
if the car is older than 20 years you
 
05:16:51.350 --> 05:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
don't need a title so why does that
 
05:16:53.190 --> 05:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
really matter one of the biggest issues
 
05:16:55.230 --> 05:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
with this um everybody has a house in
 
05:16:56.948 --> 05:16:56.958 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood that has like five old
 
05:16:59.470 --> 05:16:59.480 align:start position:0%
cars the yard that are all beat up and
 
05:17:02.030 --> 05:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
broken down and kind of just an eyesore
 
05:17:03.910 --> 05:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
those are actually really hard to send
 
05:17:07.190 --> 05:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
to the junkyard unless you have a title
 
05:17:08.628 --> 05:17:08.638 align:start position:0%
um you can't even do it you'd have to go
 
05:17:10.350 --> 05:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
get a duplicate title which gets really
 
05:17:12.270 --> 05:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
complicated so this bill would make it
 
05:17:13.830 --> 05:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
so a lot of those junk cars would be
 
05:17:15.510 --> 05:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
able to get taken to the junkyard
 
05:17:18.708 --> 05:17:18.718 align:start position:0%
recycled and get taken care of with uh
 
05:17:21.670 --> 05:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
whatever way they need to go so um the
 
05:17:23.390 --> 05:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
title is really not important on these
 
05:17:24.910 --> 05:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
cars because the market value is pretty
 
05:17:28.708 --> 05:17:28.718 align:start position:0%
low so again these two bills um let's
 
05:17:30.190 --> 05:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
send it back to the other side of the
 
05:17:32.750 --> 05:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
wall let them reconsider their position
 
05:17:34.628 --> 05:17:34.638 align:start position:0%
and let's make life a little bit easier

long thank you Mr
 
05:38:49.750 --> 05:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
05:38:51.270 --> 05:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
other side of the aisle already
 
05:38:53.750 --> 05:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
determined on this uh
 
05:38:57.548 --> 05:38:57.558 align:start position:0%
language um and that the underlying bill
 
05:38:59.628 --> 05:38:59.638 align:start position:0%
is an important issue that we must take
 
05:39:03.150 --> 05:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
up with respect to giv notice uh of a
 
05:39:06.430 --> 05:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
grandparent or a family friend to uh
 
05:39:09.350 --> 05:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
when a parent not not around to give per
 
05:39:11.030 --> 05:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
give permission to take care of the
 
05:39:13.510 --> 05:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
child uh we heard in committee that that
 
05:39:15.510 --> 05:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't the case that there were some
 
05:39:18.510 --> 05:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
doctors that refused those uh uh those
 
05:39:21.548 --> 05:39:21.558 align:start position:0%
notices uh authorizing the other person
 
05:39:25.468 --> 05:39:25.478 align:start position:0%
to take care of the child uh and if I
 
05:39:28.070 --> 05:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
know that The Advocates and the service
 
05:39:31.868 --> 05:39:31.878 align:start position:0%
providers um were strongly against this
 
05:39:34.110 --> 05:39:34.120 align:start position:0%
approximately equal parenting time it
 
05:39:35.830 --> 05:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
would create trouble because the court
 
05:39:38.468 --> 05:39:38.478 align:start position:0%
needs to deem it clear detrimental to
 
05:39:41.430 --> 05:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
the child and the current language of
 
05:39:44.070 --> 05:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
frequent continuing contact gives the
 
05:39:45.990 --> 05:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
judge the opportunity to determine
 
05:39:47.990 --> 05:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's clearly detrimental to the
 
05:39:53.468 --> 05:39:53.478 align:start position:0%
child or not uh and also that the um uh
 
05:39:58.468 --> 05:39:58.478 align:start position:0%
that one parent both in a perfect world
 
05:40:00.030 --> 05:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh both parents would have the best
 
05:40:01.628 --> 05:40:01.638 align:start position:0%
interest of the child we all know that
 
05:40:03.310 --> 05:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
this is not a perfect world there are
 
05:40:05.310 --> 05:40:05.320 align:start position:0%
there are parents that don't have the
 
05:40:07.070 --> 05:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
best interests of the child and that's
 
05:40:10.190 --> 05:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
the concern that uh that's the concern
 
05:40:11.990 --> 05:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
that I would have that this language
 
05:40:16.670 --> 05:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:19.430 --> 05:40:19.440 align:start position:0%

05:41:42.310 --> 05:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
shared parenting Arrangements has better

suggests that shared parenting can
 
05:42:18.670 --> 05:42:18.680 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
05:42:38.390 --> 05:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
that this floor amendment is entirely
 
05:42:41.030 --> 05:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
unrelated to the underlying bill and if
 
05:42:42.708 --> 05:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
I know that prior bills with similar
 
05:42:44.350 --> 05:42:44.360 align:start position:0%
language to the amendment were opposed
 
05:42:46.708 --> 05:42:46.718 align:start position:0%
by child welfare and domestic violence
 
05:42:48.468 --> 05:42:48.478 align:start position:0%
experts because it does not put
 
05:42:51.110 --> 05:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
children's best interests first and if I
 
05:42:52.548 --> 05:42:52.558 align:start position:0%
know that the child and family law
 
05:42:54.628 --> 05:42:54.638 align:start position:0%

vet and send bills forward with
 
05:42:59.190 --> 05:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
unanimous support which this language
 
05:43:01.670 --> 05:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
does not have and I believe we should
 
05:43:03.150 --> 05:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
respect the work of the child and family
 
05:43:05.270 --> 05:43:05.280 align:start position:0%

operating a new pier in the Gaza Strip
 
05:51:37.548 --> 05:51:37.558 align:start position:0%
and if I further know he testified that
 
05:51:39.670 --> 05:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
there is a high likely scenario that the
 
05:51:41.590 --> 05:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
servicemen will come under Fire while
 
05:51:44.628 --> 05:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
operating this pier and finally if I

motion on SB
 
05:55:59.868 --> 05:55:59.878 align:start position:0%
426 which would impose duplicative and
 
05:56:01.830 --> 05:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
excessive penalties on cannabis
 
05:56:04.270 --> 05:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
transported in a motor vehicle while I
 
05:56:06.350 --> 05:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
voted for this bill in committee I've
 
05:56:09.430 --> 05:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
since realized my error in doing so for
 
05:56:13.750 --> 05:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
those over 21 SB 426 would impose a $150
 
05:56:15.708 --> 05:56:15.718 align:start position:0%
fine and a possible driver's license
 
05:56:17.390 --> 05:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
suspension for possession of cannabis
 
05:56:20.230 --> 05:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
and a motor vehicle unless it's either
 
05:56:21.788 --> 05:56:21.798 align:start position:0%
in its original container with the
 
05:56:24.430 --> 05:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
sealing broken or in a trunk for
 
05:56:26.190 --> 05:56:26.200 align:start position:0%
vehicles without a trunk the glove box
 
05:56:28.350 --> 05:56:28.360 align:start position:0%
or compartment location least accessible
 
05:56:32.150 --> 05:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
to the driver for those under 21 s426
 
05:56:34.868 --> 05:56:34.878 align:start position:0%
would impose $150 fine and a possible
 
05:56:37.070 --> 05:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
driver's license suspension regardless
 
05:56:39.788 --> 05:56:39.798 align:start position:0%
of where in the vehicle that cannabis is
 
05:56:41.948 --> 05:56:41.958 align:start position:0%
more than 70% of New Hampshire voters
 
05:56:43.788 --> 05:56:43.798 align:start position:0%
want to see cannabis legalized for
 
05:56:46.910 --> 05:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
adults s SP 426 moves in the opposite
 
05:56:49.590 --> 05:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
direction under current law any
 
05:56:51.230 --> 05:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
possession of cannabis is already
 
05:56:53.910 --> 05:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
subjected to a $100 civil fine for a
 
05:56:56.430 --> 05:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
first or second offense with escalating
 
05:56:59.270 --> 05:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
penalties for each subsequent offense s
 
05:57:02.150 --> 05:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
SP 426 creates a duplicative penalty
 
05:57:04.628 --> 05:57:04.638 align:start position:0%
totaling at least
 
05:57:07.430 --> 05:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
$250 that amount is unaffordable to a
 
05:57:09.310 --> 05:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
large number of Americans and is enough
 
05:57:12.030 --> 05:57:12.040 align:start position:0%
to cause many to miss rent the driver's
 
05:57:14.190 --> 05:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
license suspension poses a serious
 
05:57:16.150 --> 05:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
economic hardship as well by making it
 
05:57:18.430 --> 05:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
impossible or cost prohibitive to go to
 
05:57:20.830 --> 05:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
work the reasons for having an open
 
05:57:22.788 --> 05:57:22.798 align:start position:0%
container law for alcohol don't make
 
05:57:25.070 --> 05:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
sense in the context of cannabis
 
05:57:27.070 --> 05:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
containers of cannabis typically include
 
05:57:29.868 --> 05:57:29.878 align:start position:0%
many days of servings whereas alcohol is
 
05:57:32.750 --> 05:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
often sold in single serving beer cans
 
05:57:34.948 --> 05:57:34.958 align:start position:0%
cannabis Edibles are usually sold with

restaurants sporting events Etc whereas
 
05:57:54.910 --> 05:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis consumers always need to bring
 
05:57:56.548 --> 05:57:56.558 align:start position:0%
cannabis with them if they're going to
 
05:57:58.788 --> 05:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
use it at their destination and their
 
05:58:00.830 --> 05:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
container of cannabis will always be
 
05:58:03.670 --> 05:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
open once they've used any in short any
 
05:58:05.628 --> 05:58:05.638 align:start position:0%
open container of cannabis is not

05:58:08.548 --> 05:58:08.558 align:start position:0%
of whether they were consuming cannabis
 
05:58:11.430 --> 05:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
while driving impaired driving is
 
05:58:13.590 --> 05:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
already illegal there is no need for
 
05:58:15.230 --> 05:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
this new penalty which would not
 
05:58:17.910 --> 05:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
increase safety it would merely ensnare
 
05:58:20.230 --> 05:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
people unaware of the law including
 
05:58:22.150 --> 05:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
drivers and passengers traveling from
 
05:58:24.390 --> 05:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
Maine and Massachusetts which have legal
 
05:58:27.548 --> 05:58:27.558 align:start position:0%
cannabis and no open container law keep
 
05:58:29.350 --> 05:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
in mind that legislation the house
 
05:58:33.030 --> 05:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
already passed hb1 1633 would address
 
05:58:35.070 --> 05:58:35.080 align:start position:0%
and impose additional fines for driving
 
05:58:37.510 --> 05:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
under the influence if we pass this bill
 
05:58:40.430 --> 05:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
today we risk increasing penalties and
 
05:58:42.110 --> 05:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
restrictions on cannabis without
 
05:58:44.708 --> 05:58:44.718 align:start position:0%
legalizing recreational use which goes
 
05:58:46.390 --> 05:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
against what granted Staters clearly
 
05:58:49.430 --> 05:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
want please reject s426 which would
 
05:58:50.948 --> 05:58:50.958 align:start position:0%
impose excessive and duplicative
 
05:58:53.510 --> 05:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
penalties and overturn the OTP motion so
 
05:58:55.468 --> 05:58:55.478 align:start position:0%
a better motion can be made thank you Mr
 
05:58:57.510 --> 05:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
Speaker do a member yield or
 
05:59:01.468 --> 05:59:01.478 align:start position:0%
questions sure member yields uh thank
 
05:59:03.750 --> 05:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question in some of my
 
05:59:05.750 --> 05:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
research for the legalization bill I saw
 
05:59:07.708 --> 05:59:07.718 align:start position:0%
that there are some sort of single
 
05:59:09.788 --> 05:59:09.798 align:start position:0%
serving that are sealed they're sort of
 
05:59:12.548 --> 05:59:12.558 align:start position:0%
jumbo joints that are huge but they are
 
05:59:14.430 --> 05:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
sealed individually do you think this
 
05:59:16.708 --> 05:59:16.718 align:start position:0%
would encourage more people to to buy
 
05:59:18.990 --> 05:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
and use those oversized joints instead
 
05:59:21.190 --> 05:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
of more reasonable cannabis I think
 
05:59:22.708 --> 05:59:22.718 align:start position:0%
potentially if they're trying to avoid
 
05:59:24.230 --> 05:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
being caught with a quote unquote open
 
05:59:27.310 --> 05:59:27.320 align:start position:0%
container thank
 
05:59:34.350 --> 05:59:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:38.110 --> 05:59:38.120 align:start position:0%
roads thank you Mr speaker Mr Speaker
 
05:59:39.468 --> 05:59:39.478 align:start position:0%
this bill was brought to us by the
 
05:59:41.510 --> 05:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
department of safety and we really
 
05:59:43.270 --> 05:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
didn't hear a whole lot of opposition to
 
05:59:44.788 --> 05:59:44.798 align:start position:0%
it as a matter of fact that came out of
 
05:59:46.708 --> 05:59:46.718 align:start position:0%
our committee 19
 
05:59:49.430 --> 05:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
to1 with that being said regardless of
 
05:59:51.230 --> 05:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
how many people want marijuana to be
 
05:59:52.868 --> 05:59:52.878 align:start position:0%
legal in the state of New Hampshire it's
 
05:59:55.030 --> 05:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
not going to be legal to operate a
 
05:59:57.628 --> 05:59:57.638 align:start position:0%
vehicle if you're high and the way this
 
05:59:59.830 --> 05:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
bill is written is that is what it aims
 
06:00:03.510 --> 06:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
to go against it is going to basically
 
06:00:05.990 --> 06:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
put marijuana in the same class of
 
06:00:08.430 --> 06:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
driving with an open container if you
 
06:00:10.590 --> 06:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
have a medical marijuana card and that
 
06:00:12.190 --> 06:00:12.200 align:start position:0%
is what you're transporting is your
 
06:00:14.468 --> 06:00:14.478 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana that is excluded in
 
06:00:16.750 --> 06:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
this bill so at the end of the day if
 
06:00:18.468 --> 06:00:18.478 align:start position:0%
you're driving down the road and you do
 
06:00:19.990 --> 06:00:20.000 align:start position:0%

nasto thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
06:04:57.590 --> 06:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
the committee amendment to Senate Bill
 
06:05:00.590 --> 06:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
508 adds a definition of anti-semitism
 
06:05:02.948 --> 06:05:02.958 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire's anti-discrimination
 
06:05:05.070 --> 06:05:05.080 align:start position:0%
laws this addition is firstly
 
06:05:05.080 --> 06:05:06.430 align:start position:0%
laws this addition is firstly
unnecessary

06:05:06.430 --> 06:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
06:05:08.190 --> 06:05:08.200 align:start position:0%
our current law already sufficiently
 
06:05:09.788 --> 06:05:09.798 align:start position:0%
protects Jewish people from
 
06:05:11.910 --> 06:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination it broadly prohibits
 
06:05:15.270 --> 06:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on race Creed color
 
06:05:18.510 --> 06:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
marital status familial status physical
 
06:05:20.990 --> 06:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
or mental disability religion or
 
06:05:23.350 --> 06:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
national origin which includes
 
06:05:26.548 --> 06:05:26.558 align:start position:0%
discrimination against uh which is Brad
 
06:05:27.910 --> 06:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
enough to includes discrimination
 
06:05:29.270 --> 06:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
against Jewish
 
06:05:32.548 --> 06:05:32.558 align:start position:0%
individuals uh sorry I got mix up here
 
06:05:34.670 --> 06:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
okay this is Broad enough to cover
 
06:05:36.868 --> 06:05:36.878 align:start position:0%
Jewish identity
 
06:05:39.468 --> 06:05:39.478 align:start position:0%
uh but this is also destructive for many
 
06:05:42.110 --> 06:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
reasons firstly by explicitly defining
 
06:05:44.510 --> 06:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism in the law there might be
 
06:05:46.390 --> 06:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
an implication that the existing
 
06:05:48.190 --> 06:05:48.200 align:start position:0%
protections are insufficient which could
 
06:05:49.708 --> 06:05:49.718 align:start position:0%
undermine the comprehensiveness and
 
06:05:51.270 --> 06:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
balance of the current
 
06:05:51.280 --> 06:05:52.750 align:start position:0%
balance of the current
anti-discrimination

06:05:52.750 --> 06:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination
 
06:05:55.230 --> 06:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
statutes this is to say inserting a
 
06:05:57.708 --> 06:05:57.718 align:start position:0%
special definition for anti-Semitism
 
06:05:59.430 --> 06:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
suggests that other groups could be
 
06:06:00.910 --> 06:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
discriminate against since they do not
 
06:06:04.230 --> 06:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
have explicit laws protecting them we'd
 
06:06:06.270 --> 06:06:06.280 align:start position:0%
have to insert similar explicit
 
06:06:09.190 --> 06:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
protections for Palestinians black
 
06:06:11.750 --> 06:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
people gay people and every other signal
 
06:06:14.510 --> 06:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
group this is why we have the concept of
 
06:06:16.548 --> 06:06:16.558 align:start position:0%
categories so we don't have to list
 
06:06:18.310 --> 06:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
every single possible instance of a
 
06:06:19.548 --> 06:06:19.558 align:start position:0%
group of people that could be
 
06:06:19.558 --> 06:06:21.310 align:start position:0%
group of people that could be
discriminated

06:06:21.310 --> 06:06:21.320 align:start position:0%
discriminated
 
06:06:23.830 --> 06:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
against moreover the definition of
 
06:06:25.548 --> 06:06:25.558 align:start position:0%
anti-semitism that this amendment wants
 
06:06:28.110 --> 06:06:28.120 align:start position:0%
to include is the definition adopted on
 
06:06:29.788 --> 06:06:29.798 align:start position:0%

anti-Semitism is a certain perception of
 
06:06:41.868 --> 06:06:41.878 align:start position:0%
Jews which may be as expressed as a
 
06:06:44.350 --> 06:06:44.360 align:start position:0%
hatred towards Jews rhetorical and
 
06:06:47.190 --> 06:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
physical manifestations of anti-Semitism
 
06:06:48.750 --> 06:06:48.760 align:start position:0%

facilities when such a definition is way
too

06:06:59.548 --> 06:06:59.558 align:start position:0%

have quasi legal effects that may impact
 
06:07:08.788 --> 06:07:08.798 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech there is concern about
 
06:07:10.990 --> 06:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
whether criticism of the state of Israel
 
06:07:14.070 --> 06:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
for example or the ADL might sometimes
 
06:07:16.750 --> 06:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
be labeled as anti-semitic under such
 
06:07:18.868 --> 06:07:18.878 align:start position:0%
definitions impacting legitimate

political expression this definition
 
06:07:24.270 --> 06:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
vagueness could politically be exploited
 
06:07:26.910 --> 06:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
to suppress legitimate discourse or
 
06:07:29.110 --> 06:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
political criticism not directly related
 
06:07:31.628 --> 06:07:31.638 align:start position:0%
to anti-emetic
 
06:07:33.948 --> 06:07:33.958 align:start position:0%
intent besides being overly broad the
 
06:07:35.750 --> 06:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
definition proposed is also in
 
06:07:37.910 --> 06:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate it is entirely possible to
 
06:07:40.150 --> 06:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
hold negative opinions and even Harbor
 
06:07:42.708 --> 06:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
negative sentiments towards Jewish
 
06:07:45.350 --> 06:07:45.360 align:start position:0%

06:07:49.750 --> 06:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
discriminating against
 
06:07:51.910 --> 06:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
individuals this proposed amendment in
 
06:07:54.150 --> 06:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
part suggests regulating our thoughts
 
06:07:56.110 --> 06:07:56.120 align:start position:0%
about institutions by applying such
 
06:07:58.910 --> 06:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
opinions on institutions are inherently
 
06:08:01.468 --> 06:08:01.478 align:start position:0%
discriminatory towards individual Jewish
 
06:08:03.868 --> 06:08:03.878 align:start position:0%
people this is a troubling overreach
 
06:08:06.030 --> 06:08:06.040 align:start position:0%
that conflicts individual
 
06:08:07.948 --> 06:08:07.958 align:start position:0%
with institutional
 
06:08:10.310 --> 06:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
criticism uh potentially stifling
 
06:08:10.320 --> 06:08:11.990 align:start position:0%
criticism uh potentially stifling
legitimate

06:08:11.990 --> 06:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
06:08:15.030 --> 06:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
discourse Mr Speaker I urge the body to
 
06:08:17.310 --> 06:08:17.320 align:start position:0%
reject this reactionary measure thank
 
06:08:20.548 --> 06:08:20.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:30.990 --> 06:08:31.000 align:start position:0%

06:08:38.590 --> 06:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr Mr Speaker
 
06:08:42.190 --> 06:08:42.200 align:start position:0%
glasses I oppose I Rise to oppose the
 
06:08:44.468 --> 06:08:44.478 align:start position:0%
amendment this is not the time or the
 
06:08:47.230 --> 06:08:47.240 align:start position:0%
place to be doing this just to be cool
 
06:08:49.868 --> 06:08:49.878 align:start position:0%
these are tough times we know what's
 
06:08:52.548 --> 06:08:52.558 align:start position:0%
going on in Israel we know Palestine and
 
06:08:55.270 --> 06:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
maybe we want to do something for them
 
06:08:57.750 --> 06:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
but carving out a special circumstance
 
06:09:01.070 --> 06:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
for one group in the Discrimination laws
 
06:09:01.080 --> 06:09:02.070 align:start position:0%
for one group in the Discrimination laws
is

06:09:02.070 --> 06:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:09:04.110 --> 06:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive and creates a type of
 
06:09:07.030 --> 06:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
reverse discrimination against all
 
06:09:10.270 --> 06:09:10.280 align:start position:0%
others not getting similar
 
06:09:13.468 --> 06:09:13.478 align:start position:0%
considerations George elal the author
 
06:09:16.468 --> 06:09:16.478 align:start position:0%
back in 1945 wrote the book The Animal
 
06:09:18.830 --> 06:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
Farm and in the area he talked about the
 
06:09:21.830 --> 06:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
thought police but he also said after
 
06:09:24.510 --> 06:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
the revolution of the
 
06:09:26.948 --> 06:09:26.958 align:start position:0%
animals they said they were all equal
 
06:09:29.468 --> 06:09:29.478 align:start position:0%
all animals are equal but some animals
 
06:09:31.670 --> 06:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
are more equal than others and this is
 
06:09:33.868 --> 06:09:33.878 align:start position:0%
where this sort of thing takes us and we
 
06:09:35.390 --> 06:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to go that way go the
 
06:09:37.468 --> 06:09:37.478 align:start position:0%
opposite direction by doing
 
06:09:39.948 --> 06:09:39.958 align:start position:0%
this all groups deserve the same
 
06:09:43.350 --> 06:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
attention not some more than others now
 
06:09:45.628 --> 06:09:45.638 align:start position:0%
yesterday there was an article put out
 
06:09:48.708 --> 06:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
by former executive counselor
 
06:09:50.910 --> 06:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
binsky those of you the Democrats have
 
06:09:53.510 --> 06:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
been around for I know him he was the
 
06:09:58.510 --> 06:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
one that uh that won the clamon decision
 
06:10:01.510 --> 06:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
he's Jewish he makes no bones about it
 
06:10:03.070 --> 06:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
he doesn't want this sort of thing he
 
06:10:04.750 --> 06:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
didn't approve of what happened at the
 
06:10:07.030 --> 06:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
national level
 
06:10:08.468 --> 06:10:08.478 align:start position:0%
but that and we should we should all
 
06:10:11.070 --> 06:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
feel that way not just Democrats or
 
06:10:13.150 --> 06:10:13.160 align:start position:0%
Republicans we should care about all of
 
06:10:15.948 --> 06:10:15.958 align:start position:0%
us and not treat one with greater
 
06:10:18.030 --> 06:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
sympathy than the
 
06:10:20.510 --> 06:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
other so I hope that you'll press red on
 
06:10:24.868 --> 06:10:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:32.030 --> 06:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:35.390 --> 06:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
roads thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:10:38.110 --> 06:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker this bill will not make it
 
06:10:39.990 --> 06:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry this amendment my apologies
 
06:10:42.990 --> 06:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment will not make it illegal
 
06:10:45.070 --> 06:10:45.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to go out and
 
06:10:47.548 --> 06:10:47.558 align:start position:0%
protest we were all at lunch today we
 
06:10:49.070 --> 06:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
all heard the individual that was
 
06:10:50.670 --> 06:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
outside screaming from the top of her
 
06:10:52.948 --> 06:10:52.958 align:start position:0%
lungs she's allowed to do that as long
 
06:10:55.788 --> 06:10:55.798 align:start position:0%
as she wants it's not illegal to do that
 
06:10:58.948 --> 06:10:58.958 align:start position:0%
but what will be illegal is to commit a
 
06:11:01.910 --> 06:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
crime while you're doing that this
 
06:11:04.350 --> 06:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
amendment will make it where if a crime
 
06:11:06.430 --> 06:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
is committed the authorities will
 
06:11:08.390 --> 06:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
actually be able to investigate the
 
06:11:10.868 --> 06:11:10.878 align:start position:0%
entire scope of the
 
06:11:13.830 --> 06:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
action we heard that this is already
 
06:11:16.150 --> 06:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
illegal yes committing crime is already
 
06:11:19.510 --> 06:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
illegal however when people come to our
 
06:11:22.150 --> 06:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
committee which they do a lot and they
 
06:11:24.390 --> 06:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
want to be able to track certain kind of
 
06:11:26.910 --> 06:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
crimes or they want certain things to be
 
06:11:29.628 --> 06:11:29.638 align:start position:0%
illegal we actually do not have a
 
06:11:32.150 --> 06:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
definition of what a hate crime is we
 
06:11:34.430 --> 06:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
don't every single person in our
 
06:11:36.190 --> 06:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
committee has our law book out and we're
 
06:11:39.110 --> 06:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
always looking it's not there this will
 
06:11:40.708 --> 06:11:40.718 align:start position:0%
make it be
 
06:11:43.750 --> 06:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
there this does not penalize anybody's
 
06:11:46.708 --> 06:11:46.718 align:start position:0%
right to free expression it explicitly
 
06:11:49.270 --> 06:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
States nothing contained in this bill is
 
06:11:51.350 --> 06:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
to be construed to diminish or infringe
 
06:11:53.350 --> 06:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
upon any right protected under the first
 
06:11:56.548 --> 06:11:56.558 align:start position:0%
amendment in the United States
 
06:11:59.868 --> 06:11:59.878 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh Additionally the reason
 
06:12:01.948 --> 06:12:01.958 align:start position:0%
that this language is what was adopted
 
06:12:03.230 --> 06:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
is because this has already been
 
06:12:06.070 --> 06:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
codified or adopted by 33 other states
 
06:12:07.948 --> 06:12:07.958 align:start position:0%
and this is the exact language that the
 
06:12:13.868 --> 06:12:13.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:17.030 --> 06:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
consent I I I think there's you know a
 
06:12:18.468 --> 06:12:18.478 align:start position:0%
lot more here but I think at the end of
 
06:12:20.590 --> 06:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
the day we we all actually get to the
 
06:12:22.990 --> 06:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
point of this and I would ask you to
 
06:12:25.030 --> 06:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
please vote for the committee Amendment
 
06:12:27.990 --> 06:12:28.000 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
06:18:30.230 --> 06:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
if I know that I read the amendment that
 
06:18:32.990 --> 06:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
just passed very carefully including the
 
06:18:35.230 --> 06:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
documents that the amendment referen
 
06:18:38.430 --> 06:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
but does not spell out and that those
 
06:18:40.788 --> 06:18:40.798 align:start position:0%
documents first the international
 
06:18:42.390 --> 06:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
Holocaust remembrance
 
06:18:44.230 --> 06:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
Association the definition of
 
06:18:46.670 --> 06:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
anti-semitism being only two sentences
 
06:18:49.310 --> 06:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
but also the 11 examples that they did
 
06:18:53.270 --> 06:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
not adopt but that this amendment adopts
 
06:18:55.150 --> 06:18:55.160 align:start position:0%
and that those and if Mr Speaker if I
 
06:18:57.430 --> 06:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
further know that seven of those 11
 
06:19:00.190 --> 06:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
examples of anti-Semitism have to do
 
06:19:02.708 --> 06:19:02.718 align:start position:0%
with criticizing the government of
 
06:19:05.350 --> 06:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
Israel and further Mr Speaker if I know
 
06:19:08.510 --> 06:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
that also the amendment codifies a 2019
 
06:19:11.788 --> 06:19:11.798 align:start position:0%
presidential executive order and I know
 
06:19:13.868 --> 06:19:13.878 align:start position:0%
that approximately half of this body
 
06:19:17.030 --> 06:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
probably would not like to cify a 2019
 
06:19:18.948 --> 06:19:18.958 align:start position:0%
presidential executive
 
06:19:21.830 --> 06:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
order and finally if I know that I want
 
06:19:24.910 --> 06:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to criticize any government
 
06:19:26.948 --> 06:19:26.958 align:start position:0%
without being called hateful of a
 
06:19:29.190 --> 06:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
religion or a Creed I would like to
 
06:19:31.430 --> 06:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
criticize the Italian government without
 
06:19:33.868 --> 06:19:33.878 align:start position:0%
being called anti-catholic or the Indian
 
06:19:35.510 --> 06:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
government without being called
 
06:19:38.390 --> 06:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
anti-hindu then Mr Speaker would I now
 
06:19:40.468 --> 06:19:40.478 align:start position:0%
press the green button and table this
 
06:19:42.750 --> 06:19:42.760 align:start position:0%

06:19:44.628 --> 06:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
