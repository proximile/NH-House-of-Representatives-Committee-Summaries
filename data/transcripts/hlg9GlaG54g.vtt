um this is this is probably all old hat
 
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
for those those of us who've been here
 
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
at least one term
 
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
but buff so most of what we're going to
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
be doing is
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh to bring the uh uh
 
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
try to get the new folks uh up to speed
 
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.389 align:start position:0%
try to get the new folks uh up to speed
but

00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
but one of the the first thing we're
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
going to do is we're going to introduce
 
00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.790 align:start position:0%
going to do is we're going to introduce
ourselves

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm again i'm going to go by the by
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
the list and uh
 
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
who we are what we do what's where do we
 
00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.070 align:start position:0%
who we are what we do what's where do we
uh

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh what how long we've served uh
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%

the with the others uh and this is a lot
 
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
easier done
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
believe me it's much easier done when
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%

i live in durham and there's very
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
few outdoor activities that i haven't
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
done which is why i'm going through my
 
00:22:01.919 --> 00:22:03.190 align:start position:0%
done which is why i'm going through my
second

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%

water issues um but
 
00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:21.039 align:start position:0%
um maybe surface water issues
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
not necessarily the pfas and all of
 
00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.430 align:start position:0%
not necessarily the pfas and all of
those

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
um but i'm interested in other things
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
relating to
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%

and also living in
 
00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:37.039 align:start position:0%

with land conservation
 
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
and um i'm concerned about our lack of
 
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:50.870 align:start position:0%
and um i'm concerned about our lack of
stewardship

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%

sorry you know again it's uh you should
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
ignore but part of what uh you we have
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
to learn and i have to still have to
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
learn it
 
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
that you should especially what you're
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
in session you use the term
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
you know you use the the representative
 
00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.309 align:start position:0%
you know you use the the representative
uh

00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
you know representative gould not linda
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
and i apologize
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
but uh you know that's that's part of
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
our system of
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh if you're if you're very if you're
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
for nice and formal then you're not you
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
you the
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
things go better things go well uh
 
00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
so it's you know it's
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
part of the tradition uh
 
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
okay beyond that anything else well i
 
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
can go into the next part of the
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
my what i'm supposed to do uh start time
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
and notice of absence all right
 
00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh normally we if this were the the
 
00:44:59.359 --> 00:45:00.309 align:start position:0%
uh normally we if this were the the
regular

00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
regular
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
we would be we would be starting at 10
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
o'clock uh
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
now what's going to what is going to be
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
happening is we will be
 
00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
going to this now special
 
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know will be special
 
00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:23.839 align:start position:0%
uh rather special rules
 
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
for because there'll be hybrid
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
situations that we have
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
the way we will be laid out as a
 
00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.470 align:start position:0%
the way we will be laid out as a
committee

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
and how we will conduct the meetings uh
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
we'll have
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
we will have to we'll be required
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
to use make maximum use
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
of the the uh
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
the these time and the space allotted
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
so the starting time will be nine
 
00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.710 align:start position:0%
so the starting time will be nine
o'clock

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
and it will end probably
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
closer to five o'clock than it normally
 
00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:00.069 align:start position:0%
closer to five o'clock than it normally
would

00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
be somewhere around 3 30 4 o'clock but
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
no we got
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
we're good the requirements is to pack
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
as much in
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
as possible uh the
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
the way we will be meeting uh
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
and we can probably talk more about this
 
00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
later is that we will be
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
we will be meeting uh
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
in a hybrid situation the hybrid
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
situation will be
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh people will be either on
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
zoom or uh or will be in
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
in the in the the come in
 
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh concord in a in a double committee
 
00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.190 align:start position:0%
uh concord in a in a double committee
room

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
room
 
00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
it will be laid out such that
 
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
the the double committee room will have
 
00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:47.510 align:start position:0%
the the double committee room will have
enough

00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
space so that we can socially distance
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
and wear masks
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
and but there was also the allowance for
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
those who wish to
 
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
meet in uh meet on a meet
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
by zoom to also participate
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
so uh the
 
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
these uh all the the big issue and big
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
issue for me
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm sad to say i
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
do not have any information on exactly
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
what day we are meeting they
 
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh they will be i
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully they they're talking about
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
that right now at the meeting that is
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
of the chairs and vice chairs that that
 
00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:35.990 align:start position:0%

was
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
scheduled to go there's a schedule right
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
on top of this meeting
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
so the vice chair is attending that
 
00:47:42.319 --> 00:47:43.670 align:start position:0%

meeting
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh and it is all

to find out what changes or what
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
variations have occurred
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
because as to how we
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
we meet the biggest thing is we're
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%

our our time will be one of the five
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
days they're going to make
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
maximum usage of time because they're
 
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200 align:start position:0%

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
only allow uh two meeting
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
so that means and that we only have the
 
00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:29.839 align:start position:0%
the third floor
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
and the second floor so those
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
those uh thing those meetings will occur
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%

assigned
 
00:48:48.069 --> 00:48:48.079 align:start position:0%
a a time slot
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh and it will be a the there will be it
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:54.069 align:start position:0%
will be a specific day that we will be
meeting

00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.079 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
on uh if i if
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
and we it will but they i have no choice
 
00:49:00.559 --> 00:49:00.870 align:start position:0%
and we it will but they i have no choice
of

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
what the meeting day is that'll be that
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:08.559 align:start position:0%
that is the uh what the speaker will be
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
making that choice uh and i think a lot
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
of it has to do with
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
the amount of uh
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
of bills we have and uh
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
i will have to negotiate the time that i
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
think i need
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
to be able to meet the
 
00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:31.839 align:start position:0%
the time they meet the time out for
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
for these bills um
 
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
so that's hopefully and i'm hoping that
 
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:39.510 align:start position:0%
so that's hopefully and i'm hoping that
uh

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:42.309 --> 00:49:42.319 align:start position:0%

uh brad can you help me with that
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
sure so um to the best of my knowledge
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
we will not be
 
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
um enabling the chat function um
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
for future means as well we um again for
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
due to right to know all concerns uh we
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
have that disabled
 
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
yeah uh i yeah this is as a public
 
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:44.710 align:start position:0%
yeah uh i yeah this is as a public
meeting

00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh the chat the chat
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
isn't viewable by by the public
 
00:50:55.349 --> 00:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
so that uh is so that that
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
that would be by we would be violating
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
the right to know law
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
so you could have you can do the chat
 
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
thing around
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
caucuses but uh because those are not
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
public meetings and the
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
public has doesn't have a right to see
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
what goes on in the caucus but
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh this this uh this meeting is not
 
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
because it is
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
bipartisan and can i
 
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
um can i also ask if um that we have the
 
00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:26.309 align:start position:0%
um can i also ask if um that we have the
ability

00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
ability
 
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
to record from our own computers
 
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
is that the same of people who are on as
 
00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.829 align:start position:0%
is that the same of people who are on as
attendees

00:51:34.829 --> 00:51:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh brad
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
as far as i would because if you ask me
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh uh personally i think that anybody
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
the meeting is recordable
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
as far as i'm concerned because it is a
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
public meeting and public meetings
 
00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh recording in a public meeting is
 
00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:55.430 align:start position:0%
uh recording in a public meeting is
allowed

00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
especially the governmental meeting
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not sure um the function of
 
00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
the attendees if they're able to record
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
but we are also putting it onto youtube
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
um so it would be available for the
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
public for
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%

talking about
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh committee hearings where people
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
can't talk in i mean
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
how are people going to testify no no
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
i'm only talking about

the chat function see there's a chat
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
function here that would allow
 
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
that is disabled because the chat
 
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.190 align:start position:0%
that is disabled because the chat

00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh allows would allow reps to talk
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
outside of the in committee while in
 
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:00.790 align:start position:0%
outside of the in committee while in
committee

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
would allow reps to communicate
 
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh without uh outside of the view of the
 
00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:07.910 align:start position:0%
uh without uh outside of the view of the
public

00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
oh okay okay i mean if we uh
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i realized that in
 
00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
the uh normal
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
under under normal circumstances i mean
 
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
one rep can lean over and say something
 
00:53:26.309 --> 00:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
of course which they'll rule them out of
 
00:53:26.319 --> 00:53:27.030 align:start position:0%
of course which they'll rule them out of
order

00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
uh but but the
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
chat is you know chat function allows a
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
conversation that can't be viewed and
 
00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:35.990 align:start position:0%
conversation that can't be viewed and
that

00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:37.349 --> 00:53:37.359 align:start position:0%
that would that would get us into
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
trouble so
 
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%

01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
any any questions or comments on that
 
01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you all right food co uh
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
food coffee and lunch breaks all right
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
we do have lunch breaks but sometimes we
 
01:01:07.109 --> 01:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
will work through them
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
the general rule is that we
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
have a we will have a lunch break
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
built into the into the schedule
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
the the general rule is no
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
food during public hearings uh
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
there's uh there should be
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh uh there's you allow
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
water you know you keep water if
 
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
if you want soda or coffee just
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
i just keep it under the table just
 
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
don't just don't
 
01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
just don't kick the cup over uh you know
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's kind of that type of thing i mean
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
fairly loose about that but uh you
 
01:01:54.079 --> 01:01:54.789 align:start position:0%
fairly loose about that but uh you
realize

01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
realize
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
uh you know having a a coke
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
sitting right in front of you uh does
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't look good
 
01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
especially if it's being uh you know
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
broadcast so just uh uh
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
but a bottle of water is fine and if you
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
know if you
 
01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
if you feel like me you'll need a candy
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
every now and then
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
sneak one but that's so that's not a not
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
but it's just sometimes
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
people will push push the issue one of
 
01:02:26.799 --> 01:02:27.510 align:start position:0%
people will push push the issue one of
the

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
also is there will be times when we will
 
01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:30.789 align:start position:0%
also is there will be times when we will
not

01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
take a lunch break but we will have we
 
01:02:33.839 --> 01:02:34.470 align:start position:0%
take a lunch break but we will have we
will

01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
will allow the hearings to continue
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
where i have would have peop people go
 
01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:41.109 align:start position:0%
where i have would have peop people go
out

01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
and bring back their lunch and eat it at
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
the at the desk
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
that's fine if i allow it you know and
 
01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:48.630 align:start position:0%
that's fine if i allow it you know and
that's

01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh that's an um a uh um that's in a
 
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
situation that's a unique situation but
 
01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
you will see that
 
01:02:59.430 --> 01:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
you might see that and in this issue
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
the way it is now you may see it more uh
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
use of electronic devices
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
dull your phone you know you put it on
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
vibrate or better yet shut it off
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh it's you know i think if it goes off
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
once you you'll be very embarrassed and
 
01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
usually it doesn't happen again until
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
the next time so
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
just uh just be aware that you have a
 
01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:31.670 align:start position:0%
just uh just be aware that you have a
phone

01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
phone
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
if you're new you're expecting a call
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
put it on but
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh put it on uh vibrate so you don't uh
 
01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
interrupt the uh
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
what's up interrupt the proceedings any
 
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
then okay next thing in my list is the
 
01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:50.789 align:start position:0%
then okay next thing in my list is the
drawer

01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
drawer
 
01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
you will be assigned
 
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
a drawer for yours for your stuff it's a
 
01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:58.870 align:start position:0%
a drawer for yours for your stuff it's a
large

01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
large
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh drawer that is for anyone who's uh
 
01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:02.549 align:start position:0%
uh drawer that is for anyone who's uh
had

01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know been in a drafting area
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
where they put that their large drawers
 
01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:10.829 align:start position:0%
where they put that their large drawers
that

01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh wide wide but now uh
 
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
but uh not very deep it's where that
 
01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:16.950 align:start position:0%
but uh not very deep it's where that
that

01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
they put in uh
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
large drawings or schematics things like
 
01:04:23.839 --> 01:04:24.309 align:start position:0%
large drawings or schematics things like
that

01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
it's that kind of drawer there's a whole
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
there are several
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
stacks of them everybody will be
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
assigned one it will have a key
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
so you can leave stuff in it uh you can
 
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
it has a reasonable amount of
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
storage space there you do not have a
 
01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.990 align:start position:0%
storage space there you do not have a
desk

01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
desk
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
the only one that has a desk
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
is the chair i
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
in the previous tour as a as the chair
 
01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh i used the desk this to basically sit
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
in it has a computer
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
and i i didn't but i did not store much
 
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
in it
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
other chairs dual use a lot use it a lot
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
my i work out of a briefcase
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
but uh again you will have a drawer you
 
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
have a lock and key
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
i do not believe they are under this
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
in the under this pen with the pandemic
 
01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:24.799 align:start position:0%
going on and in the uni
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
in the uh special meeting uh special
 
01:05:31.589 --> 01:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
uh our special system meeting
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
we will those will not be available
 
01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
you'll have to
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
anything you get any any uh
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
paperwork you take with you but that's
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
so you will not have the drawers
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
available but they are
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
once we get back to regular order uh the
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh nc to sign for security notification
 
01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
again this is this has to do with the
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
uh um
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
with our normal order when uh there will
 
01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
be a seat closest to the
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
to the door that goes to the office
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh that seat uh uh will put uh
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
put a uh a rep is that
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
to in that person's that rep
 
01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:24.799 align:start position:0%
will be uh will be
 
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
their reps responsibility will be to go
 
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
in and call security if we are having a
 
01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.470 align:start position:0%
in and call security if we are having a
problem

01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh you know we are in the public we are
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing
 
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
and sometimes people and the public get
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
a little
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
agitated uh
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
that that uh you know the uh
 
01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
this is rare but it has happened it has
 
01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
not happened to me
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
but it's happened to other chairs where
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
uh somebody gets rambunctious
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
and looks like they they they need to
 
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
they we need the presence of of a
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh security person and they or there
 
01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.029 align:start position:0%
uh security person and they or there
will

01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
be there is a a signal that i will give
 
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
to that person who's in that chair to
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
make a phone call
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:23.839 align:start position:0%
but there are also maybe times that that
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
person will have to
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
run out run and get uh running call for
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh you know someone has a heart
 
01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
problem or some medical issue again
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
those issues those that's
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's what that chair is about any
 
01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
questions on that
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
okay don't see any uh okay
 
01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:45.440 align:start position:0%

alarm exit because we can can you
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
you have to uh well i
 
01:07:55.829 --> 01:07:55.839 align:start position:0%
i think that's kind of self-explanatory
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh the committee itself
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
those are the ground rules then the
 
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
committee itself
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh the committee has as a charge i mean
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
the committee charges resources right
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
resources recreation and developments
 
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
nine it's
 
01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh item section 30 of our rules
 
01:08:17.349 --> 01:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
committee on resources recreation and
 
01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:18.390 align:start position:0%
committee on resources recreation and
development

01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
to consider all matters relating to
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
natural resources
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
water pollution and control parks and
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
recreation areas
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
recreational industries matters
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
concerning state control on property
 
01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:31.110 align:start position:0%
concerning state control on property
development

01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
and such other matters as may be
 
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
referred to it
 
01:08:37.829 --> 01:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
that's what we do that's uh that's our
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
charge but that
 
01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
you notice they said all other matters
 
01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
that may be referred to it
 
01:08:46.149 --> 01:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
so don't don't be surprised if there
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
isn't things that we get that
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't fall into that i try to get rid
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
of those bills but sometimes
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
i can't uh now the uh
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
partisan balance on on the uh
 
01:09:02.309 --> 01:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
this on the uh
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
on the the partisan balance on uh the
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
committee uh it's just these
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
constitution requires it the rules
 
01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:13.269 align:start position:0%
constitution requires it the rules
require

01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
a partisan balance generally uh
 
01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
the uh we have uh we have a
 
01:09:23.829 --> 01:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
bar that we have a balance of
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh 11 republicans in the in the majority
 
01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.070 align:start position:0%
uh 11 republicans in the in the majority
and

01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
10 democrats that's as that is as close
 
01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:31.910 align:start position:0%
10 democrats that's as that is as close
a

01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
of a partisan balance as you can as you
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
can get
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh the uh there's
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
i i have never been on a uh on any
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
committee that has an equal number
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh usually it's the majority and my
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
minority but
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh committee seating at the discretion
 
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
of the chair
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
what i will be would normally have done
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh there's a a committee uh
 
01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
there's a a form that i fill out it's
 
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
just stuff it just uh has it it has
 
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
a you see here yeah i'm trying to talk
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
with my hands it's my italian inning
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
but i try to you you have
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
a you have a basically the
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
the cut out of the uh a drawing of the
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh the layout of of the of the room
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
it has in it where
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
people will sit i
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
as chair make
 
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
the determination where people sit
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
i will definitely be uh consulting
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh uh and to get to get her
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
input and help in setting and setting
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
this up
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh the normally what a
 
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
the the way that the front the
 
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's the chair the desk or the
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
tables are set up in a u-shaped form of
 
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
inverted u the is this this the center
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
for the uh of the base of the u
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
is uh then the center of that
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
table is the chair to
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
send and so to my right will be
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
the uh the uh
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
vice chair and to
 
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh the vice to his uh right will be the
 
01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.030 align:start position:0%
uh the vice to his uh right will be the
ranking

01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
ranking
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh member okay to my left will be the
 
01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:43.990 align:start position:0%
uh member okay to my left will be the
clerk

01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
and usually you keep an empty spot there
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
on the end beside the clerk simply
 
01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.030 align:start position:0%
on the end beside the clerk simply
because

01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's good the clerk will have a lot of
 
01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:54.229 align:start position:0%
it's good the clerk will have a lot of
the

01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
the paperwork that would normally come
 
01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
in said
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
and she keeps the files and things of
 
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
that nature
 
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
so there's a necessity for additional uh
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
space oh in by the clerk
 
01:12:09.189 --> 01:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
then along these two sides there will be
 
01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:09.910 align:start position:0%
then along these two sides there will be
mixture

01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
mixture
 
01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
of folks there will be
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
the more senior people will
 
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
will be toward the front uh
 
01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
they would hopefully so
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
we can try to try to put senior people
 
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
senior people next to uh more
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
the next to more next to the new people
 
01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh and mix up uh
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
democrat and republican to get uh
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
so you can get to know basically know
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
have help and know and get to know your
 
01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
people around you
 
01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
and you believe me
 
01:12:58.630 --> 01:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
it's good to it's good to do this this
 
01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
way because
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
you you get to know somebody that you
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
know the
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
in in the in the the world outside you
 
01:13:07.679 --> 01:13:08.870 align:start position:0%
in in the in the the world outside you
know

01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
there seems to be a lot of they miss
 
01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:12.070 align:start position:0%
there seems to be a lot of they miss
they

01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
they miss the uh uh the
 
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
fact that just because somebody has a an
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
r or a d
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
next to their name doesn't it doesn't
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
make them bad
 
01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
it's just you know they you're just
 
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
different to the they'll have a
 
01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.310 align:start position:0%
different to the they'll have a
different

01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh different you know they have a
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
different idea on something
 
01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's it you'll know people and
 
01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't be afraid to ask you have a
 
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
question especially
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
the new folks if you have a question on
 
01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:39.590 align:start position:0%
the new folks if you have a question on
a

01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
procedure ask me i don't care if you're
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh i don't care what you're a d or an r
 
01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:47.270 align:start position:0%
uh i don't care what you're a d or an r
it's

01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
ask representative smith i'm certain she
 
01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:51.189 align:start position:0%
ask representative smith i'm certain she
doesn't

01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:13:53.189 --> 01:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
she she doesn't care whether you're a d
 
01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
or an r we're here to
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
we are here to guide you along and i
 
01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
think i can say
 
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
speak say that for any of those
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
those of us who have been here uh
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
more than one term or or been here at
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
least a term
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
in other words they'll help you as best
 
01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
they can
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
yeah and we try to do that on the
 
01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:15.669 align:start position:0%
yeah and we try to do that on the
committee

01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh because you'll find that most of the
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
decisions we make are unanimous
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
oddly enough and which is which kind of
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
is surprising because uh
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%

that i will
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh it's it is the yeah it's just the way
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
things are happen because that's mostly
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
what do what
 
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
what we end up doing uh
 
01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
b any questions on that
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
all right uh typical build topics
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
i think just what i just said on the
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%

hit me that uh when i was looking these
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
up i said oh my god
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
abolishing fluoridation in water so
 
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
that's coming back so
 
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
that that's that's uh that is the kind
 
01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:40.310 align:start position:0%
that that's that's uh that is the kind
of

01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
bills that we can typical topics
 
01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh any questions on that
 
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh second committee work
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh judith do you have a question yeah
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
you're not you're not
 
01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
well there's a certain value to that
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
yeah i wasn't quite sure when to ask
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
this question
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
so in terms of i think particularly for
 
01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
those of us who have bills coming up
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
um or who are trying to arrange for a
 
01:17:20.709 --> 01:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
testimony on a bill
 
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
is there any limit on the amount of
 
01:17:28.709 --> 01:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
time that somebody will be allowed to
 
01:17:28.719 --> 01:17:29.750 align:start position:0%
time that somebody will be allowed to
testify

01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
i know i i assume that we're going to
 
01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
continue with the tradition
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
of never telling anyone that they can't
 
01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.149 align:start position:0%
of never telling anyone that they can't
testify

01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:17:41.669 --> 01:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
but if we're trying to plan for um
 
01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
for the introduction of a bill
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh has there been any talk about the how
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
chairs are going to determine how how
 
01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
much time people will be given will it
 
01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:53.990 align:start position:0%
much time people will be given will it
be

01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
one person talking for three minutes or
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
will it be the whole
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
charter school being allowed to come and
 
01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:02.950 align:start position:0%
charter school being allowed to come and
talk

01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
talk
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh what i think as i know
 
01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
for now it's all it's it is all at the
 
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
discretion of the chair
 
01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh if uh if it's something is
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
coming in that is you know fresh
 
01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
or or new you know or somebody's the
 
01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:23.510 align:start position:0%
or or new you know or somebody's the
first

01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
first person testifying uh and
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's your keynote person
 
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
then i may allow a little bit i may
 
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
allow more
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
than if it's uh if it's the 20th person
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
wanting to repeat
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
everything that that's been said
 
01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:40.630 align:start position:0%
everything that that's been said
previous

01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
previous
 
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
so what are the things that i will do
 
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
i have i i will use the old trick of
 
01:18:48.149 --> 01:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
reading the people's
 
01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
i'll be doing a people sell a fill out
 
01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
well there's gonna be a virtual pink
 
01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:55.430 align:start position:0%
well there's gonna be a virtual pink
card

01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
card
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
and on that virtual pink card it's going
 
01:18:58.709 --> 01:18:58.719 align:start position:0%
to be a
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
length of time they were put down for a
 
01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
testimony when they tempted
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
when they speak if it's if it's
 
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
due to spaying for three minutes and
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's what's written on there that's
 
01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
what i will read back to you
 
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
i will say judith spang you're speaking
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
for three minutes correct
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
and that's well i will do that if i
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
have a large number of pink cards okay
 
01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
so there'll be no limit on the
 
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
number of people who will be able to
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
speak say there's an
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
a local issue and the entire
 
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
conservation commission wants to come in
 
01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
and testify yes 10 of them
 
01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh if it looks like it's dilatory and i
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
have a lot of people
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
i may i may have to say uh
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
i will i will say are you is there
 
01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:48.950 align:start position:0%
i will i will say are you is there
something

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
is there something you're going to be
 
01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
telling us that is
 
01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
different from the previous testimony
 
01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
if they're if they say yes and they
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
don't do that
 
01:20:03.189 --> 01:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
i will say is there something that you
 
01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
do that is different from the previous
 
01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:06.790 align:start position:0%
do that is different from the previous
testimony

01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
and then if they if they don't do that
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
if they ignore me again i will i will
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
say that this
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
is dilatory and i will rule them out of
 
01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:17.750 align:start position:0%
is dilatory and i will rule them out of
order

01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
order
 
01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
i mean i uh i've only got um
 
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
i have limited amount of time uh i will
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
i will be as flexible you know i'm as
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
flexible as possible on this
 
01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh but if if it looks like
 
01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
i've got a if you know especially if one
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
of these things goes into a
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh a long uh
 
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
you know a long testimony it could be
 
01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
it's interfering with other people's
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
rights now we if there's something that
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
i know
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
is going to be a large long testimony we
 
01:20:52.629 --> 01:20:52.639 align:start position:0%
will try to
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
put it in we will try to schedule a
 
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
large amount of time
 
01:20:58.510 --> 01:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
i mean yes there's times you get burned
 
01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.550 align:start position:0%
i mean yes there's times you get burned
but

01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:21:02.629 --> 01:21:02.639 align:start position:0%
you know like for instance i assume
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a large amount of
 
01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:04.950 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a large amount of
time

01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
on testimony for uh
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
for the for the fluoridation
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
and i will make it a long they won't be
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
it won't be a half an hour
 
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if i've answered your
 
01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
question but
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
yeah that's great that's kind of what i
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
was expecting and i'm hoping that the
 
01:21:25.679 --> 01:21:26.709 align:start position:0%
was expecting and i'm hoping that the
other

01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
to get a good idea from the other chairs
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
on about how they're going to handle it
 
01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
i had a
 
01:21:35.189 --> 01:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
a bill last year where um 15
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
kids from a charter school came and they
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
each delivered one sentence
 
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure how that will fly this
 
01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:43.750 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure how that will fly this
year

01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
the other thing and it's kind of related
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
we have new people who are not familiar
 
01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:50.149 align:start position:0%
we have new people who are not familiar
with

01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:21:54.149 --> 01:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
some of our issues and i'm wondering if
 
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
we could have brown bag
 
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
presentations or maybe a presentation
 
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
when on one of the days that we are not
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
in session ourselves and able
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
to bring people up to speed i know we
 
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
have in the past on that
 
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
um i know that rick vanderpoll came in
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
and gave a lecture on uh wetlands
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
and why they need to be protected and
 
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
how to do it
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
and i think that that's very useful i
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
don't know whether
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
um with some of the atv issues whether a
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
little background
 
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
on what has been going on there might be
 
01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:34.229 align:start position:0%
on what has been going on there might be
useful

01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
useful
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
that you wouldn't necessarily get
 
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
testimony okay uh
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
i'll have to consider what it is on a
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
case-by-case basis
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh i got there are other questions i got
 
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:54.320 align:start position:0%

can we post them
 
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
on our facebook page um
 
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
to reach out to people in our areas in
 
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
our towns that might be interested in
 
01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:27.750 align:start position:0%
our towns that might be interested in
them

01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
is that appropriate uh
 
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
i don't see any any reason why not
 
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative smith um
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
yeah first i'd answer uh lisa a
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
representative post
 
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
um you can also just post the link to
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
the general court website to the bill
 
01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
you don't have to write the bill itself
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
the other thing uh
 
01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
which leads me to this question of uh
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
usually we are given paper copies of all
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
of the bills before the committee
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
have we figured out how we're going to
 
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
do that this year
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
all right what's going to happen uh
 
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
as and that's that is that there's an
 
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:10.550 align:start position:0%
as and that's that is that there's an
issue

01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
you know i'm concerned about about that
 
01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
as well what because what
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
the as i know it's
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
right now we will be getting
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
a packet if the if
 
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
if you're in the if you are attending
 
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
in person i was told we will be getting
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
the uh a packet that will have the bills
 
01:24:38.719 --> 01:24:40.070 align:start position:0%
the uh a packet that will have the bills
in

01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
that will be had that will have the
 
01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.510 align:start position:0%
that will be had that will have the
testimony

01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
that is uh or any uh any printed
 
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh any uh information that is supplied
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
to the committee uh will be uh
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
will be put together by
 
01:25:02.229 --> 01:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
the uh the committee services
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
and we will be greeted with a packet
 
01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
of information uh
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
and this stuff that we would normally
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
get as handouts
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh will be asked will have to come in uh
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
and set be sent to the
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh committee services prior
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
there have so people will have to sign
 
01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.030 align:start position:0%
there have so people will have to sign
up

01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
and get their stuff in to the
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh to committee services to in order to
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
be handed out
 
01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
to us for hard copies uh the
 
01:25:40.229 --> 01:25:40.239 align:start position:0%
i would i'm going to assume that all of
 
01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
that information that comes in
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
will also be on the
 
01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh on the wire or on you know online
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
for so though to for those who do not
 
01:25:59.110 --> 01:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
the as far as copies of all the bills
 
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
i'll find out if we i can find out if we
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
can get them all mailed
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
at once to us
 
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that let me mark that down
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
as something to do
 
01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
yeah mail all copies yeah and also my
 
01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:18.870 align:start position:0%
yeah mail all copies yeah and also my
understanding

01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
is that all of the testimony will be
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
done virtually
 
01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
yes all of the testimony will be done
 
01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:25.830 align:start position:0%
yes all of the testimony will be done
virtually

01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
virtually
 
01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
there will be no place for someone to
 
01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
come in
 
01:26:34.709 --> 01:26:34.719 align:start position:0%
and sit down to present their bill even
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
if they're on another committee that is
 
01:26:36.639 --> 01:26:37.510 align:start position:0%
if they're on another committee that is
meeting

01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
and start in the building they can't
 
01:26:41.590 --> 01:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
come in
 
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh and because you you don't want
 
01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
any because people won't want to
 
01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
want to come in just to you know just to
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
make their presentation hand stuff out
 
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
well if you allow that for one you gotta
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
allow that for all
 
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
so you can't do it so that's they said
 
01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:01.590 align:start position:0%
so you can't do it so that's they said
no

01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
so that's um
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
that's uh how's getting uh getting the
 
01:27:07.679 --> 01:27:08.790 align:start position:0%
that's uh how's getting uh getting the
information

01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
okay i have another question yeah is um
 
01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
do we know yet uh
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
the status of the air exchangers for the
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
clean air
 
01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh we there's there
 
01:27:26.229 --> 01:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
there's going to be an attempt at using
 
01:27:26.239 --> 01:27:28.070 align:start position:0%
there's going to be an attempt at using
a

01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh doing a
 
01:27:33.669 --> 01:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
one committee is going to be they i
 
01:27:33.679 --> 01:27:34.629 align:start position:0%
one committee is going to be they i
they've

01:27:34.629 --> 01:27:34.639 align:start position:0%
they've
 
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
said that one committee will be will be
 
01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
trying a trial run
 
01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh next
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
this coming week that may be
 
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
that uh that to me means that
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
at least there are some of the portables
 
01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:52.629 align:start position:0%
at least there are some of the portables
available

01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
um and uh i have myself
 
01:27:59.110 --> 01:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
once i find out what one that is i will
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
probably be more looking in
 
01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
on it to see how they they the problems
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
they run into
 
01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
i mean uh uh the
 
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh i've hopefully uh they say i think
 
01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:12.709 align:start position:0%
uh i've hopefully uh they say i think
rep

01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
rep
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
they've may that meeting might still be
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
going on hopefully representative gunski
 
01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:18.070 align:start position:0%
going on hopefully representative gunski
who's

01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
who's
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
who's there uh will be able to come back
 
01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.070 align:start position:0%
who's there uh will be able to come back
and

01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
you know fill us in what's happening uh
 
01:28:26.470 --> 01:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
and he might have more of an update on
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
that if not uh
 
01:28:31.110 --> 01:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
we'll i'll get an update out because uh
 
01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:32.470 align:start position:0%
we'll i'll get an update out because uh
uh

01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
i he will i'll ask him to
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
you know write something out and say and
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
get it to everyone
 
01:28:41.910 --> 01:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
in at any rate if he's if he's not in by
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
that time
 
01:28:46.149 --> 01:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
by the by the end of this meeting uh the
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh the
 
01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean let's see i thought i had
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
something else
 
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i missed uh any other questions on
 
01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
oh yeah first of all um the
 
01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
the just to get to show you how
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
difficult some of these is
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
some of the ques some of this is
 
01:29:11.110 --> 01:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
used under normal circumstances people
 
01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
would come in
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
they'd have their their uh testimony
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh written out they'd they'd hand it out
 
01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:19.510 align:start position:0%
uh written out they'd they'd hand it out
to

01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:29:21.910 --> 01:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
to the to the representatives they would
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
they would fill out what they call a
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
pink card and the pink card would
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
have on who they are who they what they
 
01:29:29.669 --> 01:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
represent and how long they want to
 
01:29:31.110 --> 01:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
speak and then what side they're
 
01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
for or against and
 
01:29:36.550 --> 01:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
something as simple as a they're filling
 
01:29:38.709 --> 01:29:38.719 align:start position:0%
out that card
 
01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh having to do it do it all
 
01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
virtually is now a
 
01:29:47.350 --> 01:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
major production they have to fill out
 
01:29:48.629 --> 01:29:48.639 align:start position:0%
the card
 
01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
prior to it to the hearing get it in it
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
has to get
 
01:29:55.510 --> 01:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
sent get brought to the chair has to be
 
01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:56.470 align:start position:0%
sent get brought to the chair has to be
copied

01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
copied
 
01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh a chair has to sort it out so it
 
01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
suddenly becomes
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
a something that was a two minute job
 
01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:06.719 align:start position:0%
suddenly becomes a half-hour job so it's
 
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
that kind of
 
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
issue that we're we're facing uh
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
anything else did i answer your
 
01:30:11.679 --> 01:30:13.510 align:start position:0%
anything else did i answer your
questions

01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
or best as i can there are still some
 
01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
questions that i have but
 
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know as i try to work through it but
 
01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:21.910 align:start position:0%
you know as i try to work through it but
uh

01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
mr channel uh yes representative
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
harp thank you um
 
01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
on the days of the hearing are you going
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
to set specific
 
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
times or i think we passed a rule that
 
01:30:43.270 --> 01:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
you could list them all for the same
 
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
time and we just take them concurrently
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
after we finish one
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
what is your intent on that i would
 
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
rather not do that
 
01:30:55.669 --> 01:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's the senate way and it's
 
01:30:56.550 --> 01:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
what kind of
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
if you ever go to the senate they you
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
they they had a ten up everything's at
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
ten a ten o'clock ten oh one ten oh two
 
01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:08.229 align:start position:0%
ten a ten o'clock ten oh one ten oh two
twenty

01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
twenty
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
and they have all of the bills listed
 
01:31:14.550 --> 01:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
and you your people can be wasting a lot
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
of time waiting
 
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
for their their turn i would rather not
 
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
do it i think
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
what they all what they are allowing to
 
01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:23.510 align:start position:0%
what they all what they are allowing to
do

01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
is if you have bills of the same
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
type which have the same
 
01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh the the same cast of characters
 
01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
testifying suppose it's a
 
01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh ohrv bills oh set of
 
01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
bills like that and then we had several
 
01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
that were all
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
very similar you can
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
take those all at once
 
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
you don't have to keep having the same
 
01:31:53.669 --> 01:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
you don't have to keep having the
 
01:31:57.750 --> 01:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
everybody testify on the same bill
 
01:31:59.350 --> 01:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
on the time you excuse me you could have
 
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
everybody to that
 
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
you can take the testimony from one bill
 
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
and use it
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
on the other so if you if you uh if you
 
01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
gather them together
 
01:32:11.590 --> 01:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
and hopefully that will save some time
 
01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:12.550 align:start position:0%
and hopefully that will save some time
uh

01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
did i answer your question okay
 
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh the other okay i don't want this uh
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna let's see just gonna quickly
 
01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
second committee work for those who are
 
01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:26.550 align:start position:0%
second committee work for those who are
new

01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
new
 
01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
they will get we will get bills that
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
have to be out for
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
a that have to go for to a second
 
01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:33.270 align:start position:0%
a that have to go for to a second
committee

01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
so those have to get done first
 
01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh because we have a limit we'll have
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
basically half the time
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
to get it get them taken care of what's
 
01:32:42.719 --> 01:32:43.270 align:start position:0%
to get it get them taken care of what's
usually

01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
usually
 
01:32:46.470 --> 01:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
annoying and unfortunate is that
 
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
they are usually bills that have money
 
01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:49.990 align:start position:0%
they are usually bills that have money
involved

01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
and they're usually fairly complicated
 
01:32:57.270 --> 01:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
so it makes
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know if i can answer any
 
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
questions on that but
 
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's that's just a fact of
 
01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:09.830 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's that's just a fact of
life

01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
um the uh subcommittees
 
01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes the bill has uh is we like we
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
may have
 
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
some bill has issues we may take uh
 
01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
we may we may get a set up a group
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
of uh of reps
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh committee members to be part uh to go
 
01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:32.629 align:start position:0%
uh committee members to be part uh to go
offline

01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
offline
 
01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
and see what they can if they can
 
01:33:36.629 --> 01:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
improve it or hash do some
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
you know hash out what it is that is
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
wrong with the bill either
 
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
either come back with a recommendation
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
and come back with a recommendation to
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
committee whether it's
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
ought to pass out to pass with an
 
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
amendment or
 
01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
itl which is in the expedient to
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
legislate it's a
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
it it allows a subcommittee
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
is as some is put together by
 
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
is allowed by the chair
 
01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
if the chair wants it it is highly
 
01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:08.950 align:start position:0%
if the chair wants it it is highly
discouraged

01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
discouraged
 
01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
in this time we just haven't got the
 
01:34:12.239 --> 01:34:13.990 align:start position:0%
in this time we just haven't got the
time

01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
to do to do a lot of that uh
 
01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's it may what you may see
 
01:34:25.669 --> 01:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh is instead of putting a subcommittee
 
01:34:29.110 --> 01:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
on it we may retain a bill that is as
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
retaining as well is when we in the
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
committee vote to keep it
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
and not not getting pass it to the floor
 
01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
you have to get in
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
and spend some later time working on it
 
01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh it means again kicking the can down
 
01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
the road
 
01:34:48.629 --> 01:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
but if we feel that the bill deserves
 
01:34:48.639 --> 01:34:49.590 align:start position:0%
but if we feel that the bill deserves
some

01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:34:53.030 --> 01:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
deserves at least some uh additional
 
01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:53.669 align:start position:0%
deserves at least some uh additional
work

01:34:53.669 --> 01:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
and we really don't feel we have the
 
01:34:57.990 --> 01:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
time to do it rather than kill it
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
maybe we just you know we we
 
01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
move it down you may see a lot more
 
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
retained bills
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
them those um uh there's
 
01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:18.159 align:start position:0%
things about all right there's things
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
about bill files and things like that
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
about it uh we'll
 
01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
talk about the any clerk any
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
questions on that where we're going uh
 
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
i'm uh i'm going to talk a little about
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
the public hearings and the executive
 
01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
session public hearings
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
no you're going to have witnesses you
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
don't debate the witnesses you know
 
01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
that's not what they're here for you're

01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
you're to ask them questions the
 
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
questions come through the chair
 
01:35:53.669 --> 01:35:53.679 align:start position:0%
that they they are not
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
they should not be
 
01:35:59.910 --> 01:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh speeches if there's a
 
01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
if there's you know they uh they should
 
01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
be quiet all the questions come through
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
the chair in other words
 
01:36:09.510 --> 01:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
you you basically raise your hand
 
01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
i reckon i recognize you for uh
 
01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
and you said for a question i said okay
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
you get a question you don't ask a
 
01:36:19.590 --> 01:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
second question you say
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
you have you turn to the chair and say
 
01:36:22.239 --> 01:36:22.629 align:start position:0%
you have you turn to the chair and say
uh

01:36:22.629 --> 01:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
i've not you know for a follow-up you
 
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
know i'll say
 
01:36:29.189 --> 01:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
you know for a follow-up do uh
 
01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
if the one thing that
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
is that is done and i and it's
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
it is not a very good thing
 
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
and you uh is you will
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
somebody will will start making a speech
 
01:36:49.109 --> 01:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
and then we'll say would you believe
 
01:36:52.229 --> 01:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
well that is not a question
 
01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
that is a that is a speech
 
01:36:58.709 --> 01:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
put in the form of a question and
 
01:37:02.070 --> 01:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
it's not it's really not something that
 
01:37:03.109 --> 01:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
that should
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
that you really should do uh
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
did i any questions on that
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
no okay uh other than
 
01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
that okay uh uh
 
01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
okay when the sponsor is a member of the
 
01:37:19.119 --> 01:37:20.390 align:start position:0%
okay when the sponsor is a member of the
committee

01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
all right the sponsor can
 
01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
fosux delivers the bill or introduces
 
01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:37:32.830 --> 01:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
and speaks on the bill through the
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh in normally
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
in the uh in the in the uh
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh the on the testimony table there's a
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
normally a testimony table uh because
 
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
there will be no testimony table
 
01:37:52.229 --> 01:37:52.239 align:start position:0%
i will waive that requirement
 
01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
and you'll make your testimony that's
 
01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
that's me they may they make they may
 
01:37:59.590 --> 01:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
overrule me on that
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
but i i figure it's if you're there
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
you will make your testimony view
 
01:38:05.199 --> 01:38:06.310 align:start position:0%
you will make your testimony view
however

01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:38:10.229 --> 01:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
anyone who is a sponsor of a bill
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
they can take their testimony and the
 
01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:16.550 align:start position:0%
they can take their testimony and the
the

01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
the the co-sponsors
 
01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:23.360 align:start position:0%
also can their testimony but they cannot
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
ask questions of any of the
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh of the of others that are that are
 
01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:31.430 align:start position:0%
uh of the of others that are that are
testifying

01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
01:38:35.590 --> 01:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
they just sit there uh
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
and that's that's uh how i
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh how that how that goes any questions
 
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay now i see one thing in here that
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
says no action on
 
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
bill the same day as hearing uh
 
01:38:58.149 --> 01:38:58.159 align:start position:0%
that is no
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
i don't uh i think that might be
 
01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:06.159 align:start position:0%
uh overruled uh eventually because
 
01:39:10.390 --> 01:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh there is a go there is going to be
 
01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
apply uh put on every notice
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
that uh there could be an executive
 
01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:17.510 align:start position:0%
that uh there could be an executive
session

01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
at any time uh during
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
during the day that's gonna it has been
 
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
done before i personally
 
01:39:31.109 --> 01:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
don't like it i will not necessarily i
 
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
will not do it
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
except in the decisions system situation
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
i will uh i will
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
there if a bill appears to be
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh something that everyone seems to
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
agree on
 
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
at some point i may uh uh i may consult
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh or with uh
 
01:39:57.910 --> 01:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh or i i will make i may just bring up
 
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
a question i could say i will i will
 
01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:01.109 align:start position:0%
a question i could say i will i will
just

01:40:01.109 --> 01:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh the that
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh if if it appears to me that where the
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
things are going to be
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
we could that we
 
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
have time to do that we have bills that
 
01:40:16.470 --> 01:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
could be taken care of
 
01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
without having a uh
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
a notified executive session because
 
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
there is a notification
 
01:40:31.590 --> 01:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
here immediate executive session we
 
01:40:38.229 --> 01:40:38.239 align:start position:0%
we could we we could do that but i would
 
01:40:41.669 --> 01:40:41.679 align:start position:0%
if there's appears to be uh
 
01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
any uh any issues involved i would
 
01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:46.629 align:start position:0%
any uh any issues involved i would
simply

01:40:46.629 --> 01:40:46.639 align:start position:0%
simply
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh adjourn that executive session
 
01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
without a finding
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
and postpone the executive session
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%

i won't worry about that but in a normal
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
situation in the
 
01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
ring executive session first of all
 
01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:48.239 align:start position:0%

executive sessions at some point at
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
least on
 
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
the republican side and i'm assuming on
 
01:42:55.590 --> 01:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
the democrat side
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
there will be caucuses and you have to
 
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
you should caucus
 
01:43:03.750 --> 01:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
where where where the where where
 
01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
everybody is on the
 
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
on the bills once you will have some of
 
01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719 align:start position:0%
the caucuses i think will
 
01:43:15.669 --> 01:43:15.679 align:start position:0%
long as we have i i would rather the if
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
you have caucuses
 
01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
that they're done outside of the
 
01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
the time that we have to take care of
 
01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:24.870 align:start position:0%
the time that we have to take care of
bills

01:43:24.870 --> 01:43:24.880 align:start position:0%

01:43:27.270 --> 01:43:27.280 align:start position:0%

of time
 
01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
you know you can do it uh yeah you can
 
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
do it at night
 
01:43:35.189 --> 01:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
do it do it on the and caucuses are not
 
01:43:38.229 --> 01:43:38.239 align:start position:0%
you don't have to worry about uh
 
01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:41.920 align:start position:0%

01:48:07.109 --> 01:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
find one of
 
01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
maybe if uh representative smith will uh
 
01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
give you some of hers she writes a very
 
01:48:13.750 --> 01:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
good blurb
 
01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
so it'll tell you it'll it you can get
 
01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
an idea what uh what's great what's
 
01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:19.270 align:start position:0%
an idea what uh what's great what's
necessary

01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh and
 
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
also by the way when you write the blurb
 
01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
be prepared to be the person to defend
 
01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:29.990 align:start position:0%
be prepared to be the person to defend
it

01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
and we will work on that we're
 
01:48:36.390 --> 01:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
far away from that any questions
 
01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
you know i'd like to see people about
 
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
ready to hit their heads about ready to
 
01:48:40.709 --> 01:48:40.719 align:start position:0%
hit the desk
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
uh committee staff
 
01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:48.639 align:start position:0%
uh committee researcher
 
01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:05.679 align:start position:0%
so um the becoming researcher
 
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
um in house community services is um
 
01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:09.510 align:start position:0%
um in house community services is um
nonpartisan

01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan
 
01:49:11.830 --> 01:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
and we provide any research needs for
 
01:49:13.270 --> 01:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:49:15.589 --> 01:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
about about the legislation in front of
 
01:49:15.599 --> 01:49:16.310 align:start position:0%
about about the legislation in front of
them

01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:49:18.229 --> 01:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
all research requests do need to go
 
01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
through the chair
 
01:49:22.149 --> 01:49:22.159 align:start position:0%
and then material will relay that
 
01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
we also um look over the um committee
 
01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
reports as well
 
01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
for any grammatical errors um
 
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
and make sure they're good to go before
 
01:49:41.189 --> 01:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
and we also um like i said earlier we're
 
01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:45.270 align:start position:0%
and we also um like i said earlier we're
nonpartisan

01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
and um so any partisan research you'd
 
01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
like done you would have to go
 
01:49:52.149 --> 01:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
through um the different partisan
 
01:49:52.159 --> 01:49:55.270 align:start position:0%
through um the different partisan
offices

01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty much the role in a
 
01:49:58.629 --> 01:49:58.639 align:start position:0%
nutshell um
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if anyone has any questions
 
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
for that for me but
 
01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh just also you uh
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
uh the community researcher usually
 
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
part of his his function uh is to supply
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
us with
 
01:50:17.589 --> 01:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
uh uh we without with
 
01:50:20.870 --> 01:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
with copies of the law uh
 
01:50:22.830 --> 01:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
that we're in the area where work we're
 
01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:24.950 align:start position:0%
that we're in the area where work we're
working

01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
working
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
there may be an issue that is
 
01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
that i may ask the committee researcher
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
to get involved with for the for the
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
benefit of the committee
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh yeah that there's there's uh
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
he has to actually uh you know i may say
 
01:50:46.629 --> 01:50:46.639 align:start position:0%
what would do you have any information
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
can you find me any information on
 
01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh that uh on prior bills and things of
 
01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
that nature
 
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:50:59.830 --> 01:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
the you have to that's his time is
 
01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:00.390 align:start position:0%
the you have to that's his time is
limited

01:51:00.390 --> 01:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
limited
 
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
because he has these committee
 
01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:04.550 align:start position:0%
because he has these committee
researchers

01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
researchers
 
01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh have to service several committees
 
01:51:12.070 --> 01:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
so it has you have to go through the
 
01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:12.950 align:start position:0%
so it has you have to go through the
chair

01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to uh access
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
his help um elaborate
 
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
um we also um so the research we provide
 
01:51:27.510 --> 01:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
is like representative renzo said um
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
any bill histories on any previous
 
01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
legislation or if that bill had come up
 
01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:32.950 align:start position:0%
legislation or if that bill had come up
before

01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:51:35.830 --> 01:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
we do 50 state surveys um to see what
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
other states are doing
 
01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
and um those are the two
 
01:51:44.550 --> 01:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
major ones that we that we do and any
 
01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:45.510 align:start position:0%
major ones that we that we do and any
other

01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
um if you have any questions about like
 
01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
a particular topic or something we can
 
01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
research that for you as well
 
01:51:55.109 --> 01:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
thank you brad thank you now also there
 
01:51:57.030 --> 01:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
is committee assistance
 
01:51:59.350 --> 01:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
committee assistant says that's um
 
01:52:00.470 --> 01:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
heather goalie
 
01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:10.950 --> 01:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
she will she will set us up with stuff
 
01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:11.430 align:start position:0%
she will she will set us up with stuff
she

01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
she
 
01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
takes she sets the room up
 
01:52:17.270 --> 01:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
how much she's going to be doing
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
setting up the room and things and with
 
01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
our name
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
tags by the way you do get a name tag
 
01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's a not a name tag
 
01:52:29.189 --> 01:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
a name plate uh you'll start off if
 
01:52:29.199 --> 01:52:29.510 align:start position:0%
a name plate uh you'll start off if
you're

01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
a new person with uh just on paper
 
01:52:35.669 --> 01:52:35.679 align:start position:0%
but uh you eventually get a wooden one
 
01:52:35.679 --> 01:52:36.149 align:start position:0%
but uh you eventually get a wooden one
uh

01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
with a with the plastic uh
 
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
name and then your name on it uh
 
01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
that she sets that up she sets up the
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
she sets up the room
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
for us and then she also is the person
 
01:52:53.910 --> 01:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
that uh the clerk uh
 
01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
deals with and she also
 
01:53:01.990 --> 01:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:04.709 --> 01:53:04.719 align:start position:0%
member resources administrative support
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
fourth floor
 
01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
you go up to the fourth floor you get
 
01:53:10.149 --> 01:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
supplies you get
 
01:53:13.189 --> 01:53:13.199 align:start position:0%
clerical support you get copying done up
 
01:53:13.199 --> 01:53:13.589 align:start position:0%
clerical support you get copying done up
there

01:53:13.589 --> 01:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:53:16.870 --> 01:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's on the fourth floor uh
 
01:53:19.830 --> 01:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
the the statutes uh the laws are in the
 
01:53:20.709 --> 01:53:20.719 align:start position:0%
committee room
 
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
statutes are also available again
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%

the lob they're as
 
01:53:55.830 --> 01:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
the fourth floor again you have a
 
01:53:57.990 --> 01:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
computer room and you have phones
 
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
wireless computer access you have that
 
01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:01.589 align:start position:0%
wireless computer access you have that
already

01:54:01.589 --> 01:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:07.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
any uh you know any issues on rules
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know call paul smith uh
 
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's about if uh other things
 
01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh there's a lot of things about what
 
01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:23.990 align:start position:0%
uh there's a lot of things about what
this

01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
the chair has to do but i think that's i
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
think i've already wiped you out
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:34.470 --> 01:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
i see people are going when is he going
 
01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
to finish well i'm finished
 
01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh so is it
 
01:54:42.310 --> 01:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
equal yeah any questions all right uh i
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
01:54:46.149 --> 01:54:46.159 align:start position:0%
yes uh you mentioned the copy machine up
 
01:54:47.669 --> 01:54:47.679 align:start position:0%
on the fourth floor
 
01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:53.199 align:start position:0%

01:55:06.870 --> 01:55:06.880 align:start position:0%

be sending out
 
01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh as soon as i'm finished here
 
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.480 align:start position:0%

ever hold your peace uh jesus chuck
 
01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
you're not saying anything
 
01:55:32.790 --> 01:55:32.800 align:start position:0%

01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:33.430 align:start position:0%
did i did i tire you out i've been
sleeping

01:55:33.430 --> 01:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
sleeping
 
01:55:35.669 --> 01:55:35.679 align:start position:0%
candy so i i think it is a good time to
 
01:55:36.550 --> 01:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
i know i know i know i did i was
 
01:55:40.229 --> 01:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
sleeping too
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
i noticed anything else i think you did
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
a good job as far as uh
 
01:55:46.629 --> 01:55:46.639 align:start position:0%
you know particularly for the new
 
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
members those of us who are returning
 
01:55:50.950 --> 01:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
um it's pretty much the same as usual
 
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
except for we're doing it virtually
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
right now but when we
 
01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
back to the rooms uh you know hopefully
 
01:55:57.189 --> 01:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
we'll get to be able to see people face
 
01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
to face so yeah
 
01:56:01.910 --> 01:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
this this is tough right this this is uh
 
01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm kind of sad for the uh for the
 
01:56:06.229 --> 01:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
new folks because
 
01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh you're you you your
 
01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
your first year is you know it's not
 
01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
it's not what it normally is you're
 
01:56:16.149 --> 01:56:16.159 align:start position:0%
missing the pageantry a bit
 
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
you're missing the there's a there's a
 
01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
whole flavor
 
01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
to it well just just the camaraderie
 
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
particularly you know i i
 
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
mean bob and mike michael last session
 
01:56:28.149 --> 01:56:28.159 align:start position:0%
and you know put up with those two guys
 
01:56:30.629 --> 01:56:30.639 align:start position:0%
was almost almost as difficult as
 
01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with you andy but
 
01:56:36.070 --> 01:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
no nobody's as bad as me oh that's
 
01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's true
 
01:56:39.510 --> 01:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
and that's true but luckily i had bob
 
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
and mike on both sides of me to protect
 
01:56:41.750 --> 01:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
me from
 
01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
you know from you so no they were glad
 
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
you were there because you were taking
 
01:56:49.189 --> 01:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
but it but at
 
01:56:55.510 --> 01:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
any rate uh all the new folks uh
 
01:56:59.189 --> 01:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
this isn't normally the way it is and
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
one of the things that it just this is
 
01:57:03.189 --> 01:57:03.199 align:start position:0%
just you know end with
 
01:57:06.629 --> 01:57:06.639 align:start position:0%
uh the my first time i walked up
 
01:57:10.149 --> 01:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
the stair up i walked up to toward the
 
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
the state house i was a newbie never
 
01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:13.830 align:start position:0%
the state house i was a newbie never
served

01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
served
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
day one and i looked up and the building
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
looked back
 
01:57:22.070 --> 01:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
and said don't screw it up and and that
 
01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
that was kind of got to me i mean it was
 
01:57:25.350 --> 01:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
just that you were
 
01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
you were walking into a historic place
 
01:57:32.070 --> 01:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
and now you were part of history and i i
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
i'm sad that you just don't don't we
 
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
haven't really had a chance to
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
experience it yet
 
01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
but you will uh and
 
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's it is an experience and
 
01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:43.990 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's it is an experience and
you'll

01:57:43.990 --> 01:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
you'll
 
01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
you'll gain friends and uh on both sides
 
01:57:49.669 --> 01:57:49.679 align:start position:0%
of the aisle you'll gain enemies on both
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
sides of the aisle too
 
01:57:53.830 --> 01:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
but it's part of you know it's it's part
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
of the system and it's
 
01:57:57.589 --> 01:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
and we have the best democracy in the
 
01:57:59.030 --> 01:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
whole country
 
01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
because you got 400 people and you
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
you can't corrupt 400 people unless it's
 
01:58:07.510 --> 01:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
the congress
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
so you know the uh but
 
01:58:13.750 --> 01:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's all it's it's they say it's like
 
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
like herding cats to a car wash but
 
01:58:18.070 --> 01:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
this is this is democracy and i think
 
01:58:20.470 --> 01:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll you'll like it
 
01:58:24.070 --> 01:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
you know so at any rate uh
 
01:58:26.470 --> 01:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
any other anybody who has anything more
 
01:58:29.589 --> 01:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
to say anybody have uh
 
01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that being that
 
01:58:35.910 --> 01:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
we uh i will adjourn the meeting i will
 
01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
not ask for a vote because i'm just by
 
01:58:39.750 --> 01:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
doing it by
 
01:58:46.470 --> 01:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
