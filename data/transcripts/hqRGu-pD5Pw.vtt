00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 align:start position:0%
representative Manion uh to lead us in
 
00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.889 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
we don't need a quorum for hearings
 
00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 align:start position:0%
um we will need a we would need a quorum
 
00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 align:start position:0%
if we to exec uh any any uh items which
 
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
we will not be doing today uh but since
 
00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that yes we will have an
 
00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 align:start position:0%
executive session a week from today in
 
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
the afternoon
 
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh hr8 and uh welcome
 
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative Ames the prime sponsor
 
00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 align:start position:0%
glad you're here and uh
 
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
I had uh I fed about 200 messages in the
 
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
last few hours on this measure so
 
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
there's great interest in it and um
 
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
looking forward to your uh introducing
 
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for being here
 
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
well good morning and thank you and uh
 
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
of course it's not surprising that
 
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
there's great interest uh whatever point
 
00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 align:start position:0%
of view one has uh in this subject
 
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
particularly given what's happened
 
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
recently uh again whatever your views
 
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
may be
 
00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
um so I have handed out uh
 
00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
uh a couple of items one is
 
00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 align:start position:0%
essentially my statement I'm going to
 
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
read some of this but I will probably
 
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
skip over some of this too and then uh
 
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 align:start position:0%
there's a I was looking for a good
 
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
uh synopsis or summary that's uh
 
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
non-partisan that presents the legal
 
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
issues the Constitutional issues that
 
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 align:start position:0%
arise after the Bruin decision last
 
00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
I think it was in June
 
00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
and uh so that's what this Duke Center
 
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 align:start position:0%
for firearms
 
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
law handout is
 
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.790 align:start position:0%
law handout is
um

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
so diving right in
 
00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 align:start position:0%
um I am here to introduce as Prime
 
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor and to speak in support of HR
 
00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
Aid which is a proposed New Hampshire
 
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
house resolution asking the United
 
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
States Congress to enact legislation
 
00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 align:start position:0%
regulating and banning certain
 
00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 align:start position:0%
semi-automatic assault weapons and and
 
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
large capacity ammunition feeding
 
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.309 align:start position:0%
large capacity ammunition feeding
devices

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
devices
 
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
so I think we need to begin with what's
 
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 align:start position:0%
in this resolution I think ordinarily at
 
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
least the bills that I deal with which
 
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
are tax bills that are too complicated
 
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
to read text but in this case it's very
 
00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 align:start position:0%
brief so I think
 
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 align:start position:0%
I think it
 
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
is a good thing to look closely at the
 
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 align:start position:0%
text and uh there we begin with uh
 
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
so-called whereas Clauses that really
 
00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 align:start position:0%
contextual statements uh putting in
 
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
context the uh the request in the
 
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
resolution and the first of these
 
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
contextual statements
 
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh asserts and it is an assertion that
 
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 align:start position:0%
the safety and Welfare of the people of
 
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is at extreme risk due to
 
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
the absence of federal rules
 
00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
setting and providing for the
 
00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement of reasonable limits on the
 
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
manufacturer's sale ownership and use in
 
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
the United States of semi-automatic
 
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
assault weapons and large capacity
 
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
ammunition ignition feeding devices and
 
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
then that's followed with a second
 
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
whereas or contextual statement
 
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
that asserts again it's an assertion
 
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
that the extreme threat to the public
 
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
safety posed by insufficient Federal
 
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
Regulation of semi-automatic assault
 
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 align:start position:0%
weapons and large capacity ammunition
 
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
feed devices extends beyond the
 
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 align:start position:0%
boundaries and legal authority of any
 
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
single state
 
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
and therefore requires uniform
 
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
Nationwide laws and enforcement
 
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
and then we get to the actual resolution
 
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
that's called for
 
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 align:start position:0%
the result of enactment of this
 
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
hr8 the resolution requests
 
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.249 align:start position:0%
hr8 the resolution requests
urgently

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 align:start position:0%
urgently
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
all members of Congress to work together
 
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
for the earliest possible enactment of
 
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
legislation providing for Federal
 
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 align:start position:0%
Regulation of semi-automatic assault
 
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
weapons and large capacity ammunition
 
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 align:start position:0%
ammunition feeding devices
 
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 align:start position:0%
including therein reasonable definitions
 
00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
bans based on Extreme risk of harm of
 
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 align:start position:0%
certain defined
 
00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 align:start position:0%
semi-automatic assault weapons and
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
feeding devices appropriate Legacy or
 
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
grandfathering provisions and exceptions
 
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
and sufficient funding to enable timely
 
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 align:start position:0%
and responsible Nationwide
 
00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 align:start position:0%
implementation so that's the heart of
 
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.100 align:start position:0%
the resolution
 
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
I wanted to point out that there is now
 
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
a Bill in Congress it's a refiled but
 
00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
also redrafted bill in the Senate uh
 
00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
filed just I think last week
 
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 align:start position:0%
uh it was yes it was introduced on
 
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:03.740 align:start position:0%
January 23
 
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
2023 by Senator Feinstein and others
 
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
with the stated goal of protecting
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
communities from military-style assault
 
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:16.220 align:start position:0%
weapons it is a
 
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
126-page bill
 
00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419 align:start position:0%
it does a number of things and these are
 
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
in bullets it bans the sale manufacture
 
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:30.380 align:start position:0%
transfer and importation of 205
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
military-style assault weapons that are
 
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
named so they're named weapons there's a
 
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
list and the owners of the existing of
 
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
weapons as of the date of enactment of
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
this bill in the Senate as it's drafted
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm going over to second page here
 
00:07:59.150 --> 00:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
it also bans more generically any
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
assault weapon with the capacity to
 
00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:04.139 align:start position:0%
utilize a magazine that is not a fixed
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
ammunition magazine and has one or more
 
00:08:10.129 --> 00:08:10.139 align:start position:0%
military characteristics including a
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
pistol grip a forward grip a barrel
 
00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:16.979 align:start position:0%
shroud a threaded barrel or a folding or
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
telescoping stock and again owners of
 
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
these this these weapons that meet this
 
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:25.860 align:start position:0%
definition may keep them if they had
 
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
them and had acquired them before the
 
00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
date of this Senate Bill if it should be
 
00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:34.070 align:start position:0%
date of this Senate Bill if it should be
enacted

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
enacted
 
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:34.670 align:start position:0%
enacted
um

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
it to further bands this Senate bill for
 
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
the bans magazines and other ammunition
 
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
feeding devices that hold more than 10
 
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
rounds of ammunition
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
which are designed to allow Shooters to
 
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
quickly fire many rounds without needing
 
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:54.680 align:start position:0%
to reload and again owners of
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
magazines asset the date of the bill
 
00:08:59.470 --> 00:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
would be allowed to keep those
 
00:09:02.449 --> 00:09:02.459 align:start position:0%
it requires a background check on any
 
00:09:05.449 --> 00:09:05.459 align:start position:0%
future sale trade or gifting of an
 
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
assault weapon covered by the bill
 
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
it requires that grandfathered or Legacy
 
00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:14.700 align:start position:0%
assault weapons are stored using a
 
00:09:17.329 --> 00:09:17.339 align:start position:0%
secure gun storage or safety device like
 
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
a trigger lock
 
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
it prohibits the transfer of high
 
00:09:25.009 --> 00:09:25.019 align:start position:0%
capacity ammunition magazines it bans
 
00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:27.899 align:start position:0%
bump fire stocks and other devices that
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
allow semi-automatic weapons to fire at
 
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
fully automatic rates
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
and then it includes a bunch of exam
 
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
exemptions there's a long list so that's
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
why it's a multi-page so many pages are
 
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:46.220 align:start position:0%
in the Bill it exempts by name more than
 
00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519 align:start position:0%
2200 guns for hunting household defense
 
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
or recreational purposes
 
00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
and it includes a grandfather Legacy
 
00:09:59.090 --> 00:09:59.100 align:start position:0%
Clause that exempts all weapons lawfully
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
possessed at the date of enactment
 
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.389 align:start position:0%
possessed at the date of enactment
um

00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
I'll skip over the first statement here
 
00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:08.420 align:start position:0%
just to try to save time a statement by
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh Senator Blumenthal when this uh
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
Senate bill was
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
was issued was filed it's I think it's
 
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:20.220 align:start position:0%
an excellent statement but I don't need
 
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
to read it now I'll read the Sandy Hook
 
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
promise statement this is a national
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
non-profit organization as you may know
 
00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:30.779 align:start position:0%
that was founded and fed and is led by
 
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
several family members
 
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
whose loved ones were killed at Sandy
 
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
Hook Elementary School back in
 
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
2012. this is a statement in support of
 
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
the new Senate bill and they say assault
 
00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
weapons are
 
00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:48.260 align:start position:0%
military-style firearms designed to fire
 
00:10:50.829 --> 00:10:50.839 align:start position:0%
multiple rounds and quick succession
 
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
killing people quickly with little
 
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
effort that's why they've been used in
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
our country's deadliest mass shootings
 
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
from Sandy Hook and eovaldi to tragic
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
shootings in recent recent days
 
00:11:06.889 --> 00:11:06.899 align:start position:0%
and they go on we cannot accept another
 
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:09.180 align:start position:0%
moment of inaction in the first three
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
weeks of 2023 alone there have already
 
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
been 39 mass shootings including a wave
 
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:18.660 align:start position:0%
of shootings across California and in in
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
Louisiana just this week
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
sadly another school shooting also
 
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
happened in Des Moines Iowa on the heels
 
00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:29.240 align:start position:0%
of a deadly weekend of mass shootings
 
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
and finally they say every minute
 
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
lawmakers fail to stop the sale of these
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
weapons of war children's lives are at
 
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.930 align:start position:0%
weapons of war children's lives are at
risk

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
risk
 
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:41.220 align:start position:0%
I wanted to say a word about uh
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
California because they've got as you
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
probably know extensive uh laws
 
00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:52.220 align:start position:0%
designed to prevent gun violence
 
00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
and and yet they've just experienced
 
00:11:59.650 --> 00:11:59.660 align:start position:0%
these mass shootings so what's going on
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
and this is a statement from an ABC News
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
article there are too many there are too
 
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
many guns in the U.S to completely
 
00:12:10.449 --> 00:12:10.459 align:start position:0%
prevent gun violence in any given State
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
the experts that the ABC reporter was
 
00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
talking to said
 
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
gun violence is continuing to affect a
 
00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:20.459 align:start position:0%
large number of Californians but at much
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
lower rates than other states and that's
 
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
the important Point while
 
00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
3449 people died from gun violence in
 
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
California in 2020 the state still has
 
00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
one of the lowest gun death rates in the
 
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
country at 8.5 deaths per 100 000 people
 
00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:40.019 align:start position:0%
about 37 percent lower than the national
 
00:12:40.019 --> 00:12:41.269 align:start position:0%
about 37 percent lower than the national
average

00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
average
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
according to CDC
 
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:49.980 align:start position:0%
uh you know CDC data gun homicides in
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
California at a rate of 3.9 per 100 000
 
00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
people is much lower than Texas's rate
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
of 6.1 per 100 000
 
00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:02.519 align:start position:0%
people and that's from every every town
 
00:13:02.519 --> 00:13:03.710 align:start position:0%
people and that's from every every town
apparently

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
and the last thing I wanted to point to
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
is the Constitutional law issue
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
um as uh I suspect you know there's uh
 
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
been a uh a major shift in the constant
 
00:13:20.329 --> 00:13:20.339 align:start position:0%
our understanding of constitutional Law
 
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
related to the Second Amendment and uh
 
00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
and gun law statutes that uh set
 
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:30.660 align:start position:0%
restrictions on gun laws the decision
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
was uh New York Rifle and epistle
 
00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:35.959 align:start position:0%
association fee Bruin
 
00:13:40.449 --> 00:13:40.459 align:start position:0%
it was issued in I believe June 9 2022
 
00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
the primary opinion was the leading
 
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
opinion was uh justice Thomas there were
 
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
also two concurring opinions and a
 
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
descending opinion as I recall
 
00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:56.220 align:start position:0%
um and uh it was not an assault weapons
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
ban bill it was on New York's law
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
relating to pistols and concealed carry
 
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:07.940 align:start position:0%
but it had General language and clearly
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
raised new issues that have to be
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
addressed in thinking about any assault
 
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
weapons than the handout that I've
 
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
passed out and I've also got a link to
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
it here on my testimony
 
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.910 align:start position:0%
it here on my testimony
um

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
seeks to lay out the test that Bruin
 
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
calls for now to determine the
 
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of of legislation you
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
can read it for yourself I won't try to
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
summarize here but it's a multi-pronged
 
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
complex analysis that is that involves
 
00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:49.220 align:start position:0%
diving into history and usage and uh
 
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
and uh pre-existing restrictions on guns
 
00:14:58.850 --> 00:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
uh or on similar types of weapons and uh
 
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:01.620 align:start position:0%
um there's no uh there's no you can't
 
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:04.740 align:start position:0%
snap your fingers and say aha this is uh
 
00:15:06.769 --> 00:15:06.779 align:start position:0%
yeah this is okay and this is not
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
because it's not going to be that simple
 
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
um and so we're going to just have to go
 
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
through that process as we have with so
 
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
many issues in the history of this
 
00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:18.899 align:start position:0%
country and figure things out as we go
 
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
and you figure the things out by taking
 
00:15:25.129 --> 00:15:25.139 align:start position:0%
a position and here I'm asking that that
 
00:15:27.889 --> 00:15:27.899 align:start position:0%
we take a position and push forward this
 
00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:32.300 align:start position:0%
uh resolution uh calling for a ban on
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
assault weapons and um and certain
 
00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.389 align:start position:0%
assault weapons and um and certain
magazines

00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
magazines
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
and so I'm urging you to vote uh to
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
consider this bill this uh resolution
 
00:15:47.689 --> 00:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
and uh and bring it out ought to pass
 
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%

whole bunch of statistics on gun
 
00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:04.139 align:start position:0%
violence like in California and all that
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
percentages and stuff do you have those
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
statistics for uh gun violence in New
 
00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:09.650 align:start position:0%
statistics for uh gun violence in New
Hampshire

representative Manion
 
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
question uh the Feinstein bill that
 
00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:32.459 align:start position:0%
you're describing does it also uh ban
 
00:16:34.129 --> 00:16:34.139 align:start position:0%
federal agencies and law enforcement
 
00:16:35.689 --> 00:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
from carrying these same weapons of war
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
as you say it has a list of uh a number
 
00:16:43.249 --> 00:16:43.259 align:start position:0%
of categories of exemptions uh including
 
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
not every federal official but
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate Federal officials are
 
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
the the if I may the I actually have it
 
00:16:59.930 --> 00:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
here it's this thick
 
00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
okay and somewhere in here there's a
 
00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:05.459 align:start position:0%
list of these exemptions
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
um I'd be I got this off the internet I
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
can give you the okay the link I do have
 
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
a follow-up follow-up so the uh since
 
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
these keep being classified as weapons
 
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
of war do you believe that federal
 
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
agencies such as the FBI should be
 
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
operating with weapons of war within the
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
United States borders
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
well we've always uh drawn a distinction
 
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
I think in our history between civilian
 
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
life and and our law enforcement
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
agencies and law enforcement agencies
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
another follow-up this will be the last
 
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
one so uh are is the reasoning there
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
that the federal agents have more of a
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
right to defend themselves than the rest
 
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
of us
 
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh well obviously I don't know the
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
reasoning but I think that uh that is
 
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
not a right to defend themselves it's uh
 
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
it relates to training and uh a charge
 
00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:12.299 align:start position:0%
to these agencies to protect the public
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
safety and uh it puts them into a
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none representative thank you for
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
your testimony and for your measure
 
00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:34.380 align:start position:0%
uh we had slated an hour for this
 
00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
hearing and as I mentioned earlier I had
 
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
uh I've had 200 plus uh emails on this
 
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
and so we were prepared for a full house
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
and a lot of pink cards and I have one
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
pink card
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh so far and that would be from uh
 
00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:09.789 --> 00:19:09.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
there that's better good morning members
 
00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
of the committee thank you
 
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:16.919 align:start position:0%
representative hole representing the
 
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
towns of Bo sorry I've done Barton hooks
 
00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
at Allen's down in Epsom now known as
 
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:23.940 align:start position:0%
Merrimack 27.
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
here representing myself my constituents
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
as well as the members of the New
 
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Firearms Coalition an
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
organization based in New Hampshire that
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
is dedicated to protecting the rights of
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire in
 
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
particular our second amendment rights
 
00:19:41.289 --> 00:19:41.299 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot that I could talk about
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start with our request is
 
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
that you if possible indefinitely
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
postpone this bill as a recommendation
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
not just itl
 
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
this bill didn't even deserve the paper
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
it was printed on
 
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.549 align:start position:0%
it was printed on
um

00:19:55.549 --> 00:19:55.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
the former speaker made my argument for
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
me he talked about California a place
 
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
that has all sorts of laws he said that
 
00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
this was doing a good job and yet
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
they're still harm the reality is
 
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
criminals don't obey the laws that we
 
00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:15.299 align:start position:0%
put on the books
 
00:20:18.289 --> 00:20:18.299 align:start position:0%
and because of that okay one more
 
00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
additional law is only going to impact
 
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
the law-abiding citizens
 
00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:25.340 align:start position:0%
one of the members asked about whether
 
00:20:27.529 --> 00:20:27.539 align:start position:0%
there was an exemption for federal
 
00:20:30.409 --> 00:20:30.419 align:start position:0%
agents and pointed out the FBI well the
 
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
FBI is a law enforcement agency so one
 
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
might might make the argument
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
that the FBI being a law enforcement
 
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
agency might need a higher capable
 
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
firearm but what about the IRS let's at
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
least talk about the other agencies that
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
happen to have the same Firearms okay
 
00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
that are is in the business of
 
00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
um one of the members from the committee
 
00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
asked about the tables and how New
 
00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:00.539 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ranks relative to other states
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
I have that data I will send that data
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's on my laptop the FBI collects this
 
00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
data every year I happen to have in
 
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
front of me right now the table four of
 
00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
the National Crime data from 2018 and 19
 
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
because that was the quickest one I
 
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
could find on my laptop sitting in the
 
00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
seat to answer the question that was
 
00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.350 align:start position:0%
seat to answer the question that was
asked

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
asked
 
00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
murder right this is the violent crime
 
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
data violent crime data for the country
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
on a per 100 000 person basis is 5.0
 
00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
um the Northeast is slightly better than
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
that the Northeast is
 
00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:39.740 align:start position:0%
um hold on where's the number is
 
00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
3.3 in in 2019. so in general the
 
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
Northeast is doing better
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
I would love to say we're the safest
 
00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
state but main beat us
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
um Maine is down at
 
00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.669 align:start position:0%
um Maine is down at
um

00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:57.659 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
is 1.5 and New Hampshire is sorry I did
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
not bring this is 2.4 so while both New
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Maine are significantly
 
00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
lower than the Northeast as a whole and
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
the national average
 
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.029 align:start position:0%
the national average
um

00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:14.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
and why New Hampshire and Maine and
 
00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
Vermont have some of the most reasonable
 
00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
gun laws on the books when it comes to
 
00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
allowing citizens to protect themselves
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
um I would argue that no one wants to go
 
00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:30.659 align:start position:0%
commit a crime when they have a chance
 
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
that the person they're committing the
 
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
crime is going to respond back to them
 
00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
and then let's go through the language
 
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
that may be over the top
 
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
sentence line one the people of New
 
00:22:48.289 --> 00:22:48.299 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is at extreme risk
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
um the FBI data that I just described
 
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:52.980 align:start position:0%
shows exactly the opposite we are safer
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
than the rest of the nation
 
00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:57.380 align:start position:0%
it then goes on to discuss the term
 
00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:00.539 align:start position:0%
semi-automatic assault weapons
 
00:23:00.539 --> 00:23:01.310 align:start position:0%
semi-automatic assault weapons
um

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
at best that's a mischaracterization
 
00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:08.039 align:start position:0%
um modern rifles okay are not assault
 
00:23:08.039 --> 00:23:10.130 align:start position:0%
um modern rifles okay are not assault
weapons

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
weapons
 
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
modern rifles are what most people go
 
00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:14.220 align:start position:0%
target shooting with
 
00:23:16.909 --> 00:23:16.919 align:start position:0%
modern rifles allow the attachment of
 
00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:19.640 align:start position:0%
Scopes and maybe bipods
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
so you can do long-range target shooting
 
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
um this is a mischaracterization of a
 
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
typical modern firearm
 
00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
that the bill that the former member was
 
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
discussing was like 50 pages of which 40
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
are one particular firearm after a
 
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
number I've read the bill is literally a
 
00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
40 page list of ban this one that one
 
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
this one that one all the way down but
 
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
the the characterization in the front
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
um we don't have a problem here
 
00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
and the reason we don't have a problem
 
00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
here is we allow our citizens to protect
 
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
themselves protect their families
 
00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:03.059 align:start position:0%
heck I wish we would allow them to
 
00:24:06.169 --> 00:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
protect the students in their classrooms
 
00:24:06.179 --> 00:24:06.950 align:start position:0%
protect the students in their classrooms
um

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
this is an unnecessary bill I would ask
 
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
that the committee IPL at a minimum
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
indefinite postponement if that's an
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
option we should contact our house clerk
 
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
to see if it is would it even be better
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the day this is
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
not necessary
 
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
and with that I close my testimony
 
00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative questions for
 
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
representative Hole uh representative
 
00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.590 align:start position:0%
representative Hole uh representative
Massimo

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
Massimo
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:42.289 --> 00:24:42.299 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
um for a late person like me what's the
 
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
difference between semi-automatic and
 
00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:48.299 align:start position:0%
automatic thank you for the question
 
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
that's a great question so
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
semi-automatic is what most people
 
00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:56.039 align:start position:0%
have as a firearm most well almost all
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
pistols I can't think of any that are
 
00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.029 align:start position:0%
pistols I can't think of any that are
not

00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
um revolvers right are all
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
semi-automatic you pull the trigger it
 
00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:07.799 align:start position:0%
discharges one round of ammo okay and
 
00:25:09.649 --> 00:25:09.659 align:start position:0%
then cycles and is ready if you pull the
 
00:25:12.649 --> 00:25:12.659 align:start position:0%
trigger Again full auto has been
 
00:25:12.659 --> 00:25:14.090 align:start position:0%
trigger Again full auto has been
prohibited

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
um in various forms over the year
 
00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
starting with the National Firearms Act
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
forcing attacks and then subsequently in
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
numerous pieces of legislation at the
 
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
federal level fires one or sorry fires
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
more than one projectile select
 
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
firefighters three full auto continues
 
00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:32.940 align:start position:0%
to fire as long as the trigger is pulled
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
those are not in the hands of of
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
citizens and they are with several
 
00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:41.220 align:start position:0%
exceptions because they're so highly
 
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
regulated at the federal level and you
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
need a tax stamp and literally you can't
 
00:25:48.649 --> 00:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
drive to a shooting range in another
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
state without getting authorization it's
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
they are you could you could they're
 
00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.930 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:25:59.930 --> 00:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:05.900 align:start position:0%
sure is one of the safest states
 
00:26:09.289 --> 00:26:09.299 align:start position:0%
and criminals don't know what households
 
00:26:12.769 --> 00:26:12.779 align:start position:0%
have guns or they don't have guns how do
 
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
you explain that
 
00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.610 align:start position:0%
you explain that
so

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:18.649 --> 00:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
um it is good that the criminals don't
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
know which homes have firearms and which
 
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
homes do
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
in general right
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
um we have a very high percentage of
 
00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
firearm ownership in the state
 
00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
I will use my town as an example
 
00:26:39.789 --> 00:26:39.799 align:start position:0%
in 2017 we removed the license to carry
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
prior to that our Police Department
 
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
issued a summary at the end of every
 
00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
year in the town report of what they did
 
00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
and how many stops for for speeding and
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
how many home visitations and whatever
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
else there was I don't know 40
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
categories one of those categories was a
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
number of licenses issued so I went back
 
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
and did the math and 22 percent of my
 
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.430 align:start position:0%
and did the math and 22 percent of my
town

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
had a license to carry
 
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
of of the adults that's a significant
 
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.909 align:start position:0%
of of the adults that's a significant
percentage

00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
00:27:10.919 --> 00:27:11.690 align:start position:0%
percentage
um

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:11.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
I would argue that the the unknown is
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
what helps be the preventative to your
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
question of someone wanting to break
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
into someone's home they may not know
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
who's there and how that person would
 
00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
respond and there is a definite
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
psychological side to crime and if the
 
00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:33.299 align:start position:0%
person trying to commit the crime
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
realizes their action may cause their
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
own loss of life they are less likely to
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
go commit the crime
 
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Manion
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
so uh to start as a preface with the law
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement component um
 
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.690 align:start position:0%
enforcement component um
the

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
in the summer of 2020 there were several
 
00:27:57.769 --> 00:27:57.779 align:start position:0%
uh jurisdictions that told their
 
00:27:59.930 --> 00:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
citizens you're on your own during the
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
riots do you have any statistics by
 
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
chance showing defensive use of these
 
00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.269 align:start position:0%
chance showing defensive use of these
weapons

00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
weapons
 
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question unfortunately
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
um but that does bring up the point
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
about just letting law enforcement only
 
00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
carrying firearms
 
00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:18.860 align:start position:0%
I think there's a couple of high profile
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
news cases where there was Broward
 
00:28:24.769 --> 00:28:24.779 align:start position:0%
County being the first Texas being the
 
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
more recent where law enforcement were
 
00:28:30.649 --> 00:28:30.659 align:start position:0%
in fact on site prepared to defend and
 
00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
then did not and
 
00:28:36.649 --> 00:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
um so I the the carve outs for law
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement only
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
um I think actually do more harm than
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
good the bill is bad but those carve
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
C9 I would thank you representative
 
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
thank you we do have one more pink card
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
um represents several hours
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
is in the house I do want to point out
 
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker referred to this as
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
a bill and it is not a bill it is a HR
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:15.529 --> 00:29:15.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
touchy thank you Mr chairman
 
00:29:21.529 --> 00:29:21.539 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to start with answering
 
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
a question that was just given over here
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
weapons are used for defensive purposes
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
between two and three million times a
 
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:30.830 align:start position:0%
between two and three million times a
year

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:29:33.169 --> 00:29:33.179 align:start position:0%
per Federal I think it's the FBI to put
 
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
those statistics out
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh also we're hearing the term military
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
style assault weapons AR-15s
 
00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:44.820 align:start position:0%
uh if I buy a Volkswagen and I put a
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
Shelby Cobra style kit on it it doesn't
 
00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
make it a Shelby Cobra and these modern
 
00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
sporting rifles that we call AR-15s they
 
00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
just look like the replicas I mean
 
00:29:59.090 --> 00:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
they're a replica just like the
 
00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
Volkswagen and the Shelby Cobra it's a
 
00:30:03.769 --> 00:30:03.779 align:start position:0%
replica it doesn't do any more than a
 
00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
Ruger 1022 22 automatic rifle which by
 
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
the way comes with a 10 shot clip and
 
00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:13.860 align:start position:0%
that that weapon that is obviously used
 
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
for recreational purposes and mostly
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
squirrel hunting those types of things
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
it's the most popular selling rifle in
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
this country and that would be banned
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
per what I've heard earlier because you
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
can take the 10 shot clip out put a 25
 
00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:31.980 align:start position:0%
shot clip in or a 50 shot clipping I
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
know Vermont Massachusetts recently uh
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
quit selling these weapons because of
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
the fact you can replace the 10 round
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
clip that it comes with
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
with a 25 or 50 round clip the
 
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
California the California shooter used
 
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
an illegal Weapon by California law
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
so we cannot legislate this problem away
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
the weapons will be made one way or the
 
00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
other it's still legal to make weapons
 
00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
at home it's always been
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
legal to make weapons at home in this
 
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.010 align:start position:0%
legal to make weapons at home in this
country

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
so laws didn't stop the California
 
00:31:09.769 --> 00:31:09.779 align:start position:0%
shooter in Britain Australia
 
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
where weapons have been taken away from
 
00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
people even during the riots
 
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
uh they were eliminating bats kitchen
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
knives in Britain so it started out but
 
00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
first we're just taking away your
 
00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
automatic weapons or your semi-automatic
 
00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
weapons and then they took everything
 
00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
away and that is what the big concern is
 
00:31:31.559 --> 00:31:32.510 align:start position:0%
away and that is what the big concern is
here

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh gun violence well you know we have
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
China kills Millions
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
China uses Muslim people for body parts
 
00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:44.220 align:start position:0%
just like we use innocent babies here
 
00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:46.740 align:start position:0%
we've killed 63 million babies in this
 
00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:47.690 align:start position:0%
we've killed 63 million babies in this
country

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
and none of them were killed with a
 
00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
replica AR-15
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
um so these are mornings modern sporting
 
00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.909 align:start position:0%
um so these are mornings modern sporting
rifles

00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
rifles
 
00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
uh these rifles any rifle by the way is
 
00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
used less than one percent at a time you
 
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
can check those out those are FBI
 
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
statistics uh the real problem is repeat
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
criminals repeat criminals are the ones
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
that keep repeating and
 
00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
a felon is not allowed to own a weapon
 
00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
so here we go you want to solve the
 
00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:22.580 align:start position:0%
problem there's your answer
 
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh recently a former Japanese uh Premier
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
recently he was recently assassinated
 
00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:33.260 align:start position:0%
with a 3D printed plastic weapon
 
00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
you'll never stop the problem so what
 
00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
what is what is a weapon
 
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
a weapon can be me going after a smaller
 
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
guy or a woman
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
we have everybody you know a lot of
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
people carry knives I'm carrying a knife
 
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
so weapons can be anything a broken a
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
broken bottle
 
00:32:58.850 --> 00:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
Iraq whatever so taking away weapons
 
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
from innocent people that's not the
 
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
answer I'll tell you what the answer is
 
00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:04.700 align:start position:0%
we should lock up these criminals
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
particularly these repeat offenders
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
and throw the key away
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Speaker
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
I'll take questions thank you
 
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:14.700 align:start position:0%
representative question from
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman uh are you aware
 
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you are but that
 
00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:27.059 align:start position:0%
the misconception about AR-15 stands for
 
00:33:30.409 --> 00:33:30.419 align:start position:0%
assault rifle 15 when actually it's the
 
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturer armale ArmaLite yes that is
 
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
correct again yes it's a modern sporting
 
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
rifle it's used for recreation I have
 
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.009 align:start position:0%
rifle it's used for recreation I have
one

00:33:40.009 --> 00:33:40.019 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's never got itself out of the
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
closet and done any harm I can assure
 
00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.130 align:start position:0%
closet and done any harm I can assure
you

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:46.140 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
it's a modern sporting rifle I I know
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's a you know AR-15 that's right the
 
00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:53.220 align:start position:0%
original ARS are made by ArmaLite that
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
is correct
 
00:33:58.009 --> 00:33:58.019 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Finney uh go
 
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you
 
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:05.220 align:start position:0%
um I I think for taking my my question
 
00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.230 align:start position:0%
um I I think for taking my my question
um

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
Isaac I think we're all aware that we
 
00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:09.349 align:start position:0%
Isaac I think we're all aware that we
have

00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh some you know manufacturers in this
 
00:34:14.329 --> 00:34:14.339 align:start position:0%
state that that provide a lot of jobs
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
um if this was to pass and and the
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
Feinstein bill was to be signed into law
 
00:34:21.169 --> 00:34:21.179 align:start position:0%
could you envision that we would lose
 
00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
uh a few thousand jobs in New Hampshire
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
we you know we'd see closures of Sig
 
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
Sauer uh HK I think we have a uh Ruger
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh plant up here as well
 
00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.450 align:start position:0%
uh plant up here as well
um

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
can you envision that the actual goal
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
isn't only to disarm us let's put the
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
manufacturers out of business and that
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
way the only uh
 
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
you know the the rifles that are sold in
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
this country would be then bought from
 
00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.810 align:start position:0%
this country would be then bought from
overseas

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
overseas
 
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
uh absolutely the weapons would still be
 
00:34:55.609 --> 00:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
purchased uh it would put a lot of
 
00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
people out of work you're correct Ruger
 
00:34:59.450 --> 00:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
does manufacture in the western part of
 
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
our state we have Sig Sauer and Exeter I
 
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
believe that area
 
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
and so yes Not only would we lose a lot
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
of jobs here we would lose a lot of jobs
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
across the country uh with all the
 
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
peaceful protesting and burning of
 
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
cities down over the last couple three
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
years uh we have seen that people have
 
00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
used weapons to defend ourselves we have
 
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
seen how the minority population is
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
mostly at risk if they cannot defend
 
00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:26.990 align:start position:0%
mostly at risk if they cannot defend
themselves

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
and we have sold in this country year
 
00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
over year more weapons than we've ever
 
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
seen purchased before now this year it's
 
00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
actually slowed down a little bit but
 
00:35:40.849 --> 00:35:40.859 align:start position:0%
prior it's been like 20 million year
 
00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:43.140 align:start position:0%
over year more weapons being sold in
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
this country and of course the other
 
00:35:47.089 --> 00:35:47.099 align:start position:0%
side of the coin is people are always
 
00:35:49.849 --> 00:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
going to manufacture them at home that's
 
00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
just life it's been happening since we
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
founded this country long before that
 
00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
um to tie this all together would you
 
00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
believe or agree that the second
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
amendment in the closet says the well uh
 
00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
regulated militia is not pertaining to
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
regulation of laws but but the
 
00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
regulation of the actual units
 
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
themselves uh as proper trained units
 
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
and that the language and the amendment
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
was clear enough to say that we have the
 
00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
right to bear arms but is not included
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
in the amendment we have the right to
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
bear arms and those arms are not are not
 
00:36:32.569 --> 00:36:32.579 align:start position:0%
clearly defined in the amendment on
 
00:36:32.579 --> 00:36:34.609 align:start position:0%
clearly defined in the amendment on
purpose

00:36:34.609 --> 00:36:34.619 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
yes we are we have a second amendment it
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't have anything to do particularly
 
00:36:44.569 --> 00:36:44.579 align:start position:0%
with hunting or recreational shooting it
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
allows us to defend ourselves to have
 
00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
weapons and if you don't have the Second
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment you won't have the first
 
00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:55.740 align:start position:0%
amendment I mean we are the militia if
 
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
we were to be invaded by Russia China
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
pick a country it doesn't matter
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
we are the militia and that's one of the
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
reasons we haven't we don't have to
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
worry about being invaded because
 
00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
there's so many weapons in this country
 
00:37:11.089 --> 00:37:11.099 align:start position:0%
there's so many people
 
00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
prepared to defend themselves that yes
 
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
we have the Second Amendment for that
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
reason when our country was young and at
 
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
risk the second amendment was there to
 
00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
make sure that King George I believe it
 
00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
was wasn't going to come in and take
 
00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:31.079 align:start position:0%
over the country by disarming us and so
 
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
that's the Bill of Rights and that's why
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
we have the Second Amendment you're
 
00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
specifies that no one is going to come
 
00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
to your home and take your gun that's
 
00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:41.460 align:start position:0%
not the goal of the bill the goal of the
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
bill is to stop people from buying
 
00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:44.940 align:start position:0%
weapons that are designed to murder
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
people murder people that's their whole
 
00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:50.700 align:start position:0%
purpose it's not about self-defense it's
 
00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:52.740 align:start position:0%
not about hunting a deer to be honest if
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
you need a weapon of this kind of
 
00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
capacity to kill a deer you shouldn't be
 
00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
hunting you should have your eyes
 
00:38:59.930 --> 00:38:59.940 align:start position:0%
checked and maybe take a hunting course
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
to learn how to aim
 
00:39:05.569 --> 00:39:05.579 align:start position:0%
um so the goal is to prevent deaths of
 
00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:07.380 align:start position:0%
millions of people we can continue to
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
prevent provide and use the corporations
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
that representative Finney was talking
 
00:39:14.569 --> 00:39:14.579 align:start position:0%
about to provide military level weapons
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
to the military both in our country and
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
in places like Ukraine where they in
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
fact need this level of Weaponry thank
 
00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:24.589 align:start position:0%
fact need this level of Weaponry thank
you

00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
thank you representative questions for
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative gagne go ahead thank
 
00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:32.329 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
question

00:39:32.329 --> 00:39:32.339 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:34.140 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
the AR-15 or the M16 with a 0.223 round
 
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a deer rifle have you ever
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
seen a 30 odd six round
 
00:39:45.359 --> 00:39:46.730 align:start position:0%
seen a 30 odd six round
bullet

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:46.740 align:start position:0%
bullet
 
00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:49.380 align:start position:0%
I have not you should check them out and
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh I saw another hand representative
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
Manion go ahead
 
00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
00:40:01.609 --> 00:40:01.619 align:start position:0%
question I like that you mentioned uh
 
00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
Ukraine so uh up until this Invasion uh
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
it was actually unlawful for people in
 
00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
Ukraine the civilian population to be
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
armed uh so now coming with this most
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
recent Invasion they're scrambling to
 
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
train up their civilian population to
 
00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
handle Firearms who haven't in a
 
00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
generation had them so they're being
 
00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:22.140 align:start position:0%
sent into a meat grinder with no
 
00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
training no uh no arms of themselves do
 
00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
you think that like that this is a good
 
00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:30.890 align:start position:0%
you think that like that this is a good
outcome

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
your question is do I think it's a good
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
outcome that Russia invaded no the
 
00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:38.460 align:start position:0%
country unprovoked I'll clarify that the
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
civilians were disarmed uh decades ago
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
so now that they ended up scrambling now
 
00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:47.460 align:start position:0%
to arm them to fight in a war they
 
00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:49.079 align:start position:0%
aren't arming civilians they are
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
training people to be military
 
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
professionals there have been huge
 
00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
numbers if you actually look at the
 
00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:55.380 align:start position:0%
facts there have been huge numbers of
 
00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
organizations that have gone in military
 
00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
organizations that have gone into
 
00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
trained civilians to become members of
 
00:41:02.089 --> 00:41:02.099 align:start position:0%
the military and at that point they are
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
arming them I don't believe that
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
civilians need high capacity weapons at
 
00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
all I believe that the military does
 
00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:14.220 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
do you believe that the uh Invasion
 
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
would have been slowed had the civilians
 
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
been properly trained ahead of time and
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
had arms of their own as the Russians
 
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
Advance into their territory
 
00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:28.140 align:start position:0%
no I believe the invasion would have
 
00:41:29.569 --> 00:41:29.579 align:start position:0%
been slowed If the previous
 
00:41:32.089 --> 00:41:32.099 align:start position:0%
administration hadn't supported and
 
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
propped up and uh a government that has
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
been clearly misguided and believes that
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
representative toll thank you so much
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
for your testimony I was wondering if
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
you're hearing from your constituents
 
00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
that they're concerned about
 
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
semi-automatic weapons and do you think
 
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
that the majority of them would support
 
00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:55.140 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation yes in fact
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
when I went out
 
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
um door knocking as part of my campaign
 
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
one of the people I spoke to was a
 
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
marine veteran who asked me specifically
 
00:42:05.329 --> 00:42:05.339 align:start position:0%
to do whatever I could to reduce the
 
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
number of military grade weapons
 
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:10.740 align:start position:0%
available to the public he had lost his
 
00:42:13.089 --> 00:42:13.099 align:start position:0%
nephew in one of the school shootings
 
00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
and it was one where the student's
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
parents had provided him with an AR
 
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
whatever it's called I sorry I lose
 
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:22.140 align:start position:0%
track of the different high-capacity
 
00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
weapons I'm not an expert on weapons
 
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
um and I know from the kids that I
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
talked to my children's friends that
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
they have grave concerns about their
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
ability to be safe in schools as a
 
00:42:34.609 --> 00:42:34.619 align:start position:0%
result of these weapons being so easily
 
00:42:34.619 --> 00:42:35.810 align:start position:0%
result of these weapons being so easily
accessible

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
accessible
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative Finney thank you um I
 
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
hope you don't take my question as
 
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
insulting your intelligence but you
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
admitted that you don't understand you
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
know the differences between the weapons
 
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
and you you mentioned earlier deer
 
00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.690 align:start position:0%
and you you mentioned earlier deer
hunting

00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
hunting
 
00:42:55.609 --> 00:42:55.619 align:start position:0%
um we have a lot of people that serve in
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
the military that have used M16s and and
 
00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.230 align:start position:0%
the military that have used M16s and and
uh

00:42:59.230 --> 00:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
m4s which is what they are you know but
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
they are 15 is based on
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
um would you believe
 
00:43:10.609 --> 00:43:10.619 align:start position:0%
that there is no real uh
 
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
difference in the in the functionality
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
of these uh of these guns because they
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
are made to do the same thing
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
I I don't believe that now but again I'm
 
00:43:23.329 --> 00:43:23.339 align:start position:0%
not an expert I'm not
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
trained in in uh military assault
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
weapons versus the different types of
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
rifles follow up
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
follow up and in saying that would you
 
00:43:35.809 --> 00:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
agree then that the language that's used
 
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:38.700 align:start position:0%
in the testimony and that we've been
 
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
given and also in the language of the
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
resolution that it's also based on some
 
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
mischaracteriations of what these things
 
00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
actually do their their functionality
 
00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:59.569 --> 00:43:59.579 align:start position:0%
CNN thank you representative
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
we have one more uh pink card here from
 
00:44:05.329 --> 00:44:05.339 align:start position:0%
Sandra rice Hawkins of Concord who is in
 
00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:07.740 align:start position:0%
support of the bill it's and again I it
 
00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
is a not a bill it is a house resolution
 
00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
it does say support the bill and the
 
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
that is very counter-intuitive
 
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:29.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
she can tell it's my first testimony of
 
00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
the new session my name is Andreas
 
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
Hawkins I am the director of gun sense
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire a project of Grant State
 
00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
progress we are here today in support of
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
hr8 which is a house resolution
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
um a lot of my testimony has been
 
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
covered already so I'm going to narrow
 
00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:49.740 align:start position:0%
it down to why
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
the why is because American lives are
 
00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:54.660 align:start position:0%
being taken by military style weapons on
 
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
our streets
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
AR-15s are the weapon of choice for most
 
00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
Mass shooters from Sandy Hook to Uvalde
 
00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:02.460 align:start position:0%
because of how much debt they can
 
00:45:04.849 --> 00:45:04.859 align:start position:0%
inflict in such a short period of time
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
the following is just a partial list of
 
00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:10.140 align:start position:0%
what an AR-15 style weapon was used in a
 
00:45:11.329 --> 00:45:11.339 align:start position:0%
mass shooting
 
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%

Hook elementary school in Connecticut

that took 27 27 lives and over a decade
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
later those families are still waiting
 
00:45:55.609 --> 00:45:55.619 align:start position:0%
for more action to prevent that tragedy
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
from happening to others
 
00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
um I appreciated representative any
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
mentioning that these types of weapons
 
00:46:05.569 --> 00:46:05.579 align:start position:0%
are rooted in military design I think
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's really important to know when we
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
say these are military-styled weapons on
 
00:46:11.089 --> 00:46:11.099 align:start position:0%
our streets that was literally the
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
design that was created as a template
 
00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:16.140 align:start position:0%
for the military and that eventually led
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
to the AR-15s this is just one type of
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
semi-automatic that we're concerned
 
00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:20.930 align:start position:0%
semi-automatic that we're concerned
about

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:20.940 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
in 1994 our country passed an assault
 
00:46:26.089 --> 00:46:26.099 align:start position:0%
weapons ban which banned AR-15 and other
 
00:46:28.849 --> 00:46:28.859 align:start position:0%
similar sign my automatic rifles after
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
it's banned mass shootings were down in
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
the decade that followed compared to the
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
decade before and the one after
 
00:46:34.079 --> 00:46:36.410 align:start position:0%
decade before and the one after
specifically

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
gun massacres dropped 37 percent and gun
 
00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
massacred deaths dropped 43 during that
 
00:46:44.089 --> 00:46:44.099 align:start position:0%
10-year period this is real data and
 
00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:47.460 align:start position:0%
those are real lives that were saved
 
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
I know that the political odds for this
 
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
are hard this is not a prescriptive bill
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
I think one of the resolution one of the
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
things that is great about hr8 it says
 
00:46:58.130 --> 00:46:58.140 align:start position:0%
we recognize that this is an issue our
 
00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
country is facing there are solutions
 
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
that we don't have to live like this the
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
kids can go to school without fear being
 
00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:07.140 align:start position:0%
shot in their classrooms that families
 
00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
can go to the movies without having it
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
shot up the grandmothers can go to the
 
00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
grocery store and walk down the aisle
 
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:16.980 align:start position:0%
without being in fear we have a uniquely
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
American problem because we do not have
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
our policies in place that would prevent
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
these tragedies I asked this committee
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
to think very deeply about this bill
 
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
there are two outcomes when you have a
 
00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
mass shooting
 
00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
do you care
 
00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
and if you care do you care enough to
 
00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:34.609 align:start position:0%
and if you care do you care enough to
act

00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
act
 
00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
we're asking you to act
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
with that I I'm happy to take any
 
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative uh Gagney
 
00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:46.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I agree
 
00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
that all those mass shootings are
 
00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
tragedies indeed
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
but you failed to mention the fact that
 
00:47:59.930 --> 00:47:59.940 align:start position:0%
all these tragedies took place where
 
00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
people could not defend themselves
 
00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
they were they were victims there was
 
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
nobody there to answer when that person
 
00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:09.180 align:start position:0%
went in
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
and did their things that's why why the
 
00:48:13.609 --> 00:48:13.619 align:start position:0%
gun-free zones and the malls the gun
 
00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
free zones and so-called is there a
 
00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
question representative yes there is
 
00:48:19.609 --> 00:48:19.619 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
that had someone else been armed
 
00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
was a good guy been able to act and
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
mitigate the tragedy thank you for the
 
00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
question representative we actually have
 
00:48:34.849 --> 00:48:34.859 align:start position:0%
had situations where armed individuals
 
00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
have been present and these tragedies
 
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
have happened in States where people can
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
carry firearms and locations where they
 
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
can carry firearms in fact in one mass
 
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
shooting there is an armed individual
 
00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:48.900 align:start position:0%
who ran and tackled the person they
 
00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:50.460 align:start position:0%
believed to be the shooter well it
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
turned out they didn't tackle the person
 
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
who was the shooter they tackled the
 
00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
person who had previously tackled the
 
00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
shooter and thank goodness hesitated
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
before they pulled out their firearm
 
00:49:02.569 --> 00:49:02.579 align:start position:0%
that's one widely publicized issue but
 
00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
that's not what this bill is about we're
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
actually not talking about where people
 
00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
can and cannot be armed we're talking
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
about high capacity weapons being on our
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
on our street weapons that are from a
 
00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:15.540 align:start position:0%
military design that are not for any
 
00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
other function then the purpose for
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
which it was created that is not healthy
 
00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
for American lives I will tell you I'm
 
00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:25.140 align:start position:0%
not gonna set I'm not going to entertain
 
00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions about different types
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
of firearms because I'm not a Firearms
 
00:49:32.329 --> 00:49:32.339 align:start position:0%
expert I'm a public health expert I'm a
 
00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
I protect my kids and the and the kids
 
00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
in my community expert I am I don't want
 
00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:38.460 align:start position:0%
to live in fear and I don't think other
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
people should have to live in fear
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
either that is the issue we're talking
 
00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
about here thank you
 
00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
representative Kerry
 
00:49:50.089 --> 00:49:50.099 align:start position:0%
you cited some statistics earlier the 37
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
and 47 7 43 I'm sorry could you tell me
 
00:49:57.650 --> 00:49:57.660 align:start position:0%
the source of your statistics please yep
 
00:49:59.809 --> 00:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
that one specifically University of
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts researcher Louis Clare
 
00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
best and I can send that report to folks
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
along with some of the other data that's
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
been compiled most uh there's been
 
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
obviously a lot of time and a lot of
 
00:50:14.569 --> 00:50:14.579 align:start position:0%
debate on this topic so there are a lot
 
00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
of studies that show the drop in the um
 
00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:20.220 align:start position:0%
uh those gun deaths before and after
 
00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
that time period
 
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:50:28.849 --> 00:50:28.859 align:start position:0%
uh I have a quick question if I if I may
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
so you cited in other speakers earlier
 
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:34.140 align:start position:0%
cited some horrific gun violence
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
examples uh you gave several from around
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
the country but not New Hampshire my so
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
my question is is your concern in the
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
concerns of the supporters of this
 
00:50:47.809 --> 00:50:47.819 align:start position:0%
resolution uh based on
 
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
events outside of New Hampshire are
 
00:50:51.549 --> 00:50:51.559 align:start position:0%
there any New Hampshire
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
incidents that you could cite that would
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
support these you're concerned yeah that
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
is an excellent question and I thank you
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
for our chair
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
um so this is a house resolution for
 
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
Congress to take action and I think
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
knowing about what has been happening
 
00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:09.180 align:start position:0%
across the country it is why it is
 
00:51:10.609 --> 00:51:10.619 align:start position:0%
important for us to push forward and
 
00:51:13.609 --> 00:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
ensure that that is something that we
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
can rely on at the federal level also
 
00:51:17.329 --> 00:51:17.339 align:start position:0%
when you have policies like this in
 
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
place from state to state it does create
 
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
a patchwork which leaves all of us more
 
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
susceptible and vulnerable to New
 
00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specifically and this question
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
comes up a lot and again violence
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
prevention work what are the specific
 
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
examples here well I can tell you a lot
 
00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
about suicide rates that's one of our
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
biggest issues we have here with
 
00:51:38.089 --> 00:51:38.099 align:start position:0%
Firearms mass shootings we have been
 
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
lucky we've had very few incidences in
 
00:51:42.109 --> 00:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
our history where we've had multiple
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
victims in a gun shooting but I will
 
00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
tell you that we have had incidents here
 
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
we've had an incident at Concord High
 
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
um a couple decades ago we've had an
 
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
incident in a newspaper location just
 
00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:54.900 align:start position:0%
this week on Monday we heard about a
 
00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:56.700 align:start position:0%
credible school shooting threat where a
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
student was apprehended in the North
 
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
country that happened two days before
 
00:52:02.569 --> 00:52:02.579 align:start position:0%
school got out these are things that
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
actually happen and we are lucky I think
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
Uvaldi would have said we've never had a
 
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
mass shooting right Newtown would have
 
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
said we've never had a mass shooting
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
nobody's had a mass shooting until it
 
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
happens but that's not what it's about
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't have to wait until people
 
00:52:18.849 --> 00:52:18.859 align:start position:0%
lose their lives to take action
 
00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:20.940 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:23.460 align:start position:0%
other questions so representative uh
 
00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:28.970 align:start position:0%
other questions so representative uh
Cole

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:30.049 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:52:30.049 --> 00:52:30.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
so much for your um for your testimony I
 
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
know Granite State progress works with a
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
lot of parents and teachers in the state
 
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
do you feel like the majority of
 
00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:42.900 align:start position:0%
teachers that you work with would be in
 
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
support of this resolution
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh that is an excellent question as well
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
um I do we have talked to a lot of
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
families and a lot of Educators who are
 
00:52:54.049 --> 00:52:54.059 align:start position:0%
very concerned about gun violence
 
00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
happening in our country and I think
 
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes we hear the responses about
 
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
hardening our schools or things like
 
00:53:01.069 --> 00:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
that I'll tell you I'm a mother of two
 
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
young children I have a seven-year-old
 
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
and a three-year-old I don't want them
 
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
to go to school at a prison like that is
 
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
not the answer we know what the answer
 
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
it is it's making sure that people
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
complete background checks it's not
 
00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:16.740 align:start position:0%
giving Firearms to people before that
 
00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
background check has been completed it's
 
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
not having capacity weapons on our
 
00:53:22.849 --> 00:53:22.859 align:start position:0%
street my children deserve to go to
 
00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
school and learn and have the freedom to
 
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
learn an environment that is is where
 
00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:29.220 align:start position:0%
they can explore and open I don't want
 
00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
to hear about another mass shooting
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
where somebody spends days asking
 
00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not a teacher left a door
 
00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.410 align:start position:0%
whether or not a teacher left a door
open

00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
do you know how many times kids open and
 
00:53:41.329 --> 00:53:41.339 align:start position:0%
close doors in a school on a given day I
 
00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
go up to drop off stuff for PTA and I
 
00:53:46.329 --> 00:53:46.339 align:start position:0%
come back I have to go through a
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
intercom a lock system when I was a kid
 
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
you could just parents could walk in and
 
00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
out why do we have that it's not because
 
00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
of the other threats in society it's
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
because of gun violence that is
 
00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
ridiculous and that's one minor thing
 
00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
that I don't mind doing because it gives
 
00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
Safety and Security to others but how
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
many more times are we going to continue
 
00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:10.140 align:start position:0%
to to create solutions that are not the
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
actual solution thank you follow up
 
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
question follow up
 
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
just addressed that the majority of
 
00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:24.170 align:start position:0%
just addressed that the majority of
teach

00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:27.049 --> 00:54:27.059 align:start position:0%
parents do you feel that vast majority
 
00:54:29.569 --> 00:54:29.579 align:start position:0%
of the public school parents that
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
Granite State progress Works in
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
Coalition with would be supportive of
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
this resolution absolutely and I think
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
that that is not just true for the
 
00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
people that I know pulling in our state
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
employee nationally has shown that there
 
00:54:44.809 --> 00:54:44.819 align:start position:0%
is a lot of support for gun violence
 
00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
prevention measures
 
00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
is there another hand
 
00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:50.870 align:start position:0%
is there another hand
um

00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:53.089 --> 00:54:53.099 align:start position:0%
representative pimani
 
00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you think mental
 
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
health has placed more of a part than
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
the actual gun violence that's happening
 
00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:05.220 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire
 
00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:06.660 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate that question
 
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
because as a gun violence prevention
 
00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
Advocate and also someone who carries
 
00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
very deeply about Mental Health Systems
 
00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
in our country we often hear that period
 
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
in with mass shootings I want to say
 
00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
that if people have the proper care
 
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
systems that they need one that's a
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
really important issue but two people
 
00:55:27.049 --> 00:55:27.059 align:start position:0%
have mental health challenges in
 
00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
countries around the world and we they
 
00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
don't have the mass shootings that our
 
00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
country experiences so I would not say
 
00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:34.260 align:start position:0%
that there is a direct correlation
 
00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:36.300 align:start position:0%
between those two again I think it has
 
00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:37.980 align:start position:0%
to do with the policies that we have on
 
00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:39.470 align:start position:0%
to do with the policies that we have on
firearms

00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
firearms
 
00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:49.270 align:start position:0%
firearms
foreign

00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
go ahead oh yeah thank you so I was
 
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
holding this because I thought I'd be
 
00:55:54.049 --> 00:55:54.059 align:start position:0%
asked about it
 
00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
um I heard some of the previous speakers
 
00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
asked about
 
00:55:59.329 --> 00:55:59.339 align:start position:0%
um Firearms around law enforcement and I
 
00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
did just want to make the point that um
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
if we remove some of the military-styled
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
weapons on our streets then the
 
00:56:08.569 --> 00:56:08.579 align:start position:0%
militarization and the continued
 
00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:10.380 align:start position:0%
proliferation of higher capacity weapons
 
00:56:12.589 --> 00:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
among our law enforcement would also not
 
00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:14.220 align:start position:0%
be as much of a need so representative
 
00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
Finney I know that's an interest of
 
00:56:17.329 --> 00:56:17.339 align:start position:0%
yours I would encourage you to consider
 
00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
from that perspective and represent a
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you all right density hand over
 
00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:27.829 align:start position:0%
thank you all right density hand over
there

00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
you can turn my microphone on sorry
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
um is there an instance where the good
 
00:56:38.809 --> 00:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
guy with the gun has not worked out
 
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
um specifically to the body armor
 
00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:43.730 align:start position:0%
um specifically to the body armor
piercing

00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
um ammunition oh um for the second bill
 
00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
um so you know the good guy with a gun
 
00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
and I know that this came up earlier I
 
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
I'm just gonna tell you briefly a short
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
my short entry into gun violence
 
00:56:59.690 --> 00:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
prevention that I think addresses us
 
00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
better than anything else we often hear
 
00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
that as a pushback to take in action and
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
while I don't think it's particular to
 
00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:08.890 align:start position:0%
while I don't think it's particular to
um

00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:08.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
hr8 I will say that in 1999 I was a high
 
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
school senior I was played in
 
00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
um in tennis championships I was getting
 
00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
ready for prom I was getting ready to
 
00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:22.980 align:start position:0%
graduate and a few States over in
 
00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:24.010 align:start position:0%
graduate and a few States over in
Colorado

00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:24.020 align:start position:0%
Colorado
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
we had the mass shooting at Columbine
 
00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
and you know as a 17 year old student
 
00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:32.220 align:start position:0%
and that was not the first shooting by
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
mass shooting at a school by the way
 
00:57:35.329 --> 00:57:35.339 align:start position:0%
there had been one the year previous as
 
00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:37.140 align:start position:0%
a 17 year old student that really rocked
 
00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
me the fact that kids who were doing the
 
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
exact same thing I was doing were shot
 
00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
down in the halls of their school and I
 
00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
remember that Following fall while I was
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
at college going to a presentation by
 
00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:51.900 align:start position:0%
the Brady campaign and there were folks
 
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
from the gun lobby and their folks from
 
00:57:55.069 --> 00:57:55.079 align:start position:0%
gun violence prevention groups and they
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
were having this debate and that was one
 
00:57:58.370 --> 00:57:58.380 align:start position:0%
of the main arguments people were
 
00:58:00.829 --> 00:58:00.839 align:start position:0%
talking about at that time and people
 
00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:02.460 align:start position:0%
were asked to cite
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
on both sides and I didn't hear stories
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
valid stories cited stories news or
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
stories of the good guy with a gun and
 
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
in the now and oh my gosh I'm gonna have
 
00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
to do some math here you know I it has
 
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
been over 20 years and we still have
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
that kind of debate but we still don't
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
actually have a lot of hard data
 
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
examples to point to and so I just think
 
00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:28.740 align:start position:0%
that that's a little bit of a red
 
00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
hearing or misnomer and that doesn't
 
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
happen as much as maybe some people
 
00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
would like to believe or you know when I
 
00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
get if you're a carrier firearm and you
 
00:58:37.789 --> 00:58:37.799 align:start position:0%
want to think about how you would
 
00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:39.900 align:start position:0%
respond in that situation but the
 
00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
reality is that is not often how it
 
00:58:45.289 --> 00:58:45.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
after the federal assault weapons ban is
 
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:01.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
I would thank you so much for your time
 
00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
and for taking the questions
 
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
Columbine just came up a couple times my
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
spouse went to Columbine High School in
 
00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
Littleton Colorado I've actually visited
 
00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:16.740 align:start position:0%
that that school where they have some
 
00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:18.470 align:start position:0%
that that school where they have some
monuments

monuments
 
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
uh is there anyone else you would like
 
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:27.660 align:start position:0%
and say none we will close this at
 
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
exactly 10 30. this is veterans

s infrastructure
 
01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:54.900 align:start position:0%
in 1945 following the defeat of fascism
 
01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
in the second world war Europe lay in
 
01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:58.670 align:start position:0%
in the second world war Europe lay in
ruin

01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
ruin
 
01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
small villages and cities that stood for
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
centuries laid in rubble in the wake of
 
01:04:05.809 --> 01:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
the most devastating war in human
 
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
history and the question of post-war
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
plans sat in front of the minds of all
 
01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:14.819 align:start position:0%
in the United States Secretary of State
 
01:04:17.329 --> 01:04:17.339 align:start position:0%
George Marshall advised president Harry
 
01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
Truman that an economic recovery program
 
01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
was needed for Europe after all Hitler's
 
01:04:25.309 --> 01:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
rise and the Nazi domination of Europe
 
01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
originated in the economic desperation
 
01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
that was the Great Depression
 
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
Truman and Marshall knew that unless
 
01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
Europe was put back on its feet the
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
forces of authoritarianism and division
 
01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
could once again play on the desperation
 
01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:42.839 align:start position:0%
of the population
 
01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
though not so dramatically many
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
communities across the United States
 
01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
face Dire Straits today
 
01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
Midwest communities hollowed out by
 
01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
years of de-industrialization rural
 
01:04:57.770 --> 01:04:57.780 align:start position:0%

01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:00.180 align:start position:0%

and these crisises create problems there
 
01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
are economic costs but also death
 
01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
and this level of Despair is a direct
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
threat to our democracy just as we saw
 
01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
our political polarization today stems
 
01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
from in part A sense of last call a
 
01:05:33.289 --> 01:05:33.299 align:start position:0%
feeling that we have reached the end of
 
01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
history in our most fundamental
 
01:05:38.210 --> 01:05:38.220 align:start position:0%
institutions are incapable of fixing our
 
01:05:41.329 --> 01:05:41.339 align:start position:0%
most basic problems this leads to fear
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
fear leads to anger and anger leads to
 
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
hate and hate leads to suffering
 
01:05:49.130 --> 01:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
concerns about the economy and the
 
01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
climate if unresolved may lead people to
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
seek out a strong man who promises to
 
01:05:56.089 --> 01:05:56.099 align:start position:0%
fix all of our problems as so many
 
01:05:58.130 --> 01:05:58.140 align:start position:0%
societies before us have
 
01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:00.299 align:start position:0%
democracies work when people have faith
 
01:06:02.450 --> 01:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
in the future people feel they can
 
01:06:04.609 --> 01:06:04.619 align:start position:0%
invest their faith in a system when they
 
01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
feel like they have a future an American
 
01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
martial plan which will rebuild our
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
communities build climate infrastructure
 
01:06:14.690 --> 01:06:14.700 align:start position:0%
give people good jobs and Inspire
 
01:06:17.089 --> 01:06:17.099 align:start position:0%
Americans will give people this Faith
 
01:06:20.329 --> 01:06:20.339 align:start position:0%
and Hope and in turn it could save our
 
01:06:20.339 --> 01:06:21.770 align:start position:0%
and Hope and in turn it could save our
democracy

01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
01:06:24.049 --> 01:06:24.059 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for hearing my
 
01:06:24.059 --> 01:06:26.210 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for hearing my
testimony

01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
thank you representative would you be
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
willing to take any questions if there
 
01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:38.790 align:start position:0%
and and seeing none uh
 
01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:44.089 align:start position:0%
and and seeing none uh
[Laughter]

01:06:44.089 --> 01:06:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
we have a question from representative
 
01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
to sound simple but you know I think we
 
01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
should we should know our terms so so
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
what do you mean by by climate
 
01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.549 align:start position:0%
what do you mean by by climate
infrastructure

01:06:55.549 --> 01:06:55.559 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
01:06:58.190 --> 01:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
my climate infrastructure so I mean
 
01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:01.140 align:start position:0%
putting people to work with green jobs
 
01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
for example good union jobs building
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
carbon neutral housing would be a
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
concrete example thank you so much for
 
01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
representative Lundgren
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.770 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:23.329 --> 01:07:23.339 align:start position:0%
your concept
 
01:07:26.089 --> 01:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's uh What uh president
 
01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
just enacted was the build back better
 
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
uh program
 
01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
so why do we even waste our time so this
 
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
is a little bit different than that this
 
01:07:40.609 --> 01:07:40.619 align:start position:0%
is more like the FDR's New Deal which
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
put folks to work it gave them hope
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
during desperate times and it made it so
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
people who had good jobs could put back
 
01:07:52.849 --> 01:07:52.859 align:start position:0%
money into the economy and now on top of
 
01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
it with the climate crisis we could
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
actually put people to work
 
01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
with green jobs so that way we're
 
01:08:03.289 --> 01:08:03.299 align:start position:0%
addressing both problems simultaneously
 
01:08:06.529 --> 01:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
the climate crisis and that people need
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
good paying jobs with Benefits thank you
 
01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
so much I appreciate the question thank
 
01:08:12.599 --> 01:08:13.730 align:start position:0%
so much I appreciate the question thank
you

01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative gagne thank you thank you
 
01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you spoke about
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
good union jobs does that mean that if
 
01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
you didn't join a union you wouldn't be
 
01:08:23.410 --> 01:08:23.420 align:start position:0%
able to work
 
01:08:26.689 --> 01:08:26.699 align:start position:0%
I would hope thank you question for your
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
question rep gagne I would like to see
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say that specifically in this
 
01:08:35.329 --> 01:08:35.339 align:start position:0%
HR I would hope that under the Marshall
 
01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
Plan that we would Inc that are that are
 
01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
federal delegation would support and
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
propose putting people to work with good
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
paying unionized jobs
 
01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:52.020 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you are you aware that
 
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
this President Administration on the
 
01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
first day in office
 
01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
killed the Keystone Pipeline which
 
01:08:59.390 --> 01:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
skilled seven thousand union jobs
 
01:09:03.530 --> 01:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
so I am not here to speak to that I am
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
here today to speak to a Marshall Plan
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
similar to what the New Deal was that
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
puts people to work Building green
 
01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in order to put people
 
01:09:19.249 --> 01:09:19.259 align:start position:0%
back to work and help solve the climate
 
01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
crisis thank you representative gagne
 
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I have one last
 
01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.090 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I have one last
question

01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
um I know it's not included in here
 
01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
um and we can argue the merits of the
 
01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
New Deal all day
 
01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:35.940 align:start position:0%
um but that uh required a lot of
 
01:09:39.169 --> 01:09:39.179 align:start position:0%
huge you know spending and we're still
 
01:09:40.849 --> 01:09:40.859 align:start position:0%
paying on that with Social Security and
 
01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
Medicare programs that are that are
 
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
insolvent currently
 
01:09:48.650 --> 01:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
um how would we be funding uh the plan
 
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
here for for long-term Equity I think
 
01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:52.849 align:start position:0%
here for for long-term Equity I think
those

01:09:52.849 --> 01:09:52.859 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
have benefited
 
01:09:59.450 --> 01:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
our economy and the United States and I
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
would like to see programs like that
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
preserved and expanded and so I think
 
01:10:09.169 --> 01:10:09.179 align:start position:0%
that this is we when we invest
 
01:10:09.179 --> 01:10:10.550 align:start position:0%
that this is we when we invest
in

01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:10:12.530 --> 01:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
solving problems
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
when we invest in Social Services and
 
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
putting people to work in education we
 
01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
spend less money on criminalization and
 
01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:20.930 align:start position:0%
spend less money on criminalization and
militarization

01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
militarization
 
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
and I personally we're going to spend
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
the money no matter what would rather
 
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
spend money putting people to work and
 
01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
green infrastructure then on
 
01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
criminalization and militarization which
 
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
is what happens when we lack Social
 
01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:36.830 align:start position:0%
is what happens when we lack Social
Services

01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
and when people don't have hope for a
 
01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
good future thank you so much
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative the Marshall Plan would
 
01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
you say sometimes is wonderful history
 
01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:50.930 align:start position:0%
you say sometimes is wonderful history
and

01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:53.209 --> 01:10:53.219 align:start position:0%
um so but that name has been taken uh do
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
you have a suggested name for this plan
 
01:10:57.770 --> 01:10:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
to do a new Marshall Plan just like we
 
01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
would do an it's a new a green deal is a
 
01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
version of the New Deal to meet Modern
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
Times And so the problems today are a
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
little different than they were during
 
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
the FDR Administration but the premise
 
01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
is the same thank you so much
 
01:11:22.970 --> 01:11:22.980 align:start position:0%

new faces representative Manion whom I

had not met before but I discovered that
 
01:46:23.410 --> 01:46:23.420 align:start position:0%
we we and you
 
01:46:27.050 --> 01:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
have a common Bond we are both former
 
01:46:28.609 --> 01:46:28.619 align:start position:0%
members of the United States Marine
 
01:46:32.930 --> 01:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
Corps 1956 to 1958 for me back before
 
01:46:35.050 --> 01:46:35.060 align:start position:0%
most of you were born
 
01:46:38.330 --> 01:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
and I wear the stripes proudly that I
 
01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
got and I had on my show on my arm
 
01:46:45.410 --> 01:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
but in any case when I was uh
 
01:46:49.850 --> 01:46:49.860 align:start position:0%
a a young person uh going to school
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
um that was a day there was something
 
01:46:54.169 --> 01:46:54.179 align:start position:0%
that the older ones Among Us will
 
01:46:56.209 --> 01:46:56.219 align:start position:0%
remember remember called the Soviet
 
01:46:56.219 --> 01:46:57.649 align:start position:0%
remember remember called the Soviet
Union

01:46:57.649 --> 01:46:57.659 align:start position:0%
Union
 
01:47:00.830 --> 01:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
um and uh the president back in those
 
01:47:02.810 --> 01:47:02.820 align:start position:0%
days or the presidents back in those
 
01:47:05.570 --> 01:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
days frequently talked about the captive
 
01:47:08.629 --> 01:47:08.639 align:start position:0%
nations of Europe and so forth and how
 
01:47:10.990 --> 01:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
important it was to have
 
01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.790 align:start position:0%
important it was to have
self-determination

01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
self-determination
 
01:47:16.370 --> 01:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
for the captive peoples
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
um and I haven't been educated back in
 
01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:21.719 align:start position:0%
the public schools of the Midwest I was
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
thought that we were
 
01:47:31.490 --> 01:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
trying to promote that all around the
 
01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:32.649 align:start position:0%
trying to promote that all around the
world

01:47:32.649 --> 01:47:32.659 align:start position:0%
world
 
01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
I discovered much later that it mostly
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
to apply to countries being dominated by
 
01:47:44.410 --> 01:47:44.420 align:start position:0%
the Soviet Union and not So Much by
 
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
some areas that were under American
 
01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
control and one of them and a number of
 
01:47:53.330 --> 01:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
my fellow Marines back in those days
 
01:47:55.870 --> 01:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
were from Puerto Rico
 
01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
and so as I read history as a student in
 
01:48:03.470 --> 01:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
college and so forth I became more aware
 
01:48:07.129 --> 01:48:07.139 align:start position:0%
of uh of how Puerto Rico became a part
 
01:48:11.410 --> 01:48:11.420 align:start position:0%
of the possessions of the United States
 
01:48:15.129 --> 01:48:15.139 align:start position:0%
and became progressively more unhappy
 
01:48:19.129 --> 01:48:19.139 align:start position:0%
with the fate of the people of Puerto
 
01:48:21.470 --> 01:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
Rico especially if they were living in
 
01:48:23.629 --> 01:48:23.639 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico many of them of course had
 
01:48:26.229 --> 01:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
come to the United States because
 
01:48:29.270 --> 01:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
the economic situation Puerto Rico was
 
01:48:31.370 --> 01:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
not that great and there was more
 
01:48:34.729 --> 01:48:34.739 align:start position:0%
opportunity in back up in the in the
 
01:48:39.290 --> 01:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
United States so uh but but I was I must
 
01:48:43.010 --> 01:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
say I was especially unhappy in the
 
01:48:45.770 --> 01:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
recent hurricane uh the devastated
 
01:48:47.689 --> 01:48:47.699 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico
 
01:48:51.770 --> 01:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
um and and the the damage from the
 
01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
hurricane in so many ways still has not
 
01:48:58.270 --> 01:48:58.280 align:start position:0%
been sufficiently repaired
 
01:48:58.280 --> 01:48:59.830 align:start position:0%
been sufficiently repaired
and

01:48:59.830 --> 01:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:02.750 --> 01:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
we had just a few days ago a power
 
01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:04.729 align:start position:0%
we had just a few days ago a power
outage

01:49:04.729 --> 01:49:04.739 align:start position:0%
outage
 
01:49:07.729 --> 01:49:07.739 align:start position:0%
in here in New Hampshire in many places
 
01:49:11.090 --> 01:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
my power went out for 15 or 20 minutes
 
01:49:13.370 --> 01:49:13.380 align:start position:0%
some people were out for a couple of
 
01:49:16.609 --> 01:49:16.619 align:start position:0%
days some people in Puerto Rico their
 
01:49:18.770 --> 01:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
power is still out
 
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
still out imagine what it is like in the
 
01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
year 2023 when we have all kinds of
 
01:49:29.470 --> 01:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
devices in our homes that are powered by
 
01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
electricity when the power goes out
 
01:49:36.890 --> 01:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
they are just like paperweights they're
 
01:49:38.930 --> 01:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
not doing the job that we bought them
 
01:49:43.629 --> 01:49:43.639 align:start position:0%
for so to have your power out for years
 
01:49:49.390 --> 01:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
means you're back in the 16 or 1700s so
 
01:49:52.990 --> 01:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
I bring you today uh house resolution
 
01:49:58.010 --> 01:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
13. I know you all can read so I I won't
 
01:49:59.930 --> 01:49:59.940 align:start position:0%
read it to you
 
01:50:02.770 --> 01:50:02.780 align:start position:0%
um but I will
 
01:50:07.550 --> 01:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
cite just one set of whereas for more
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
than 100 years the people of Puerto Rico
 
01:50:12.410 --> 01:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
have contributed greatly to the United
 
01:50:15.770 --> 01:50:15.780 align:start position:0%
States and to democracy by serving with
 
01:50:18.530 --> 01:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
dedication and honor in all armed
 
01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
conflicts in the United States armed
 
01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:22.070 align:start position:0%
conflicts in the United States armed
forces

01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
forces
 
01:50:25.070 --> 01:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
um the Puerto Ricans are doing right by
 
01:50:29.050 --> 01:50:29.060 align:start position:0%
us uh and I think it's time for us to do
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
certainly right by the Puerto Ricans
 
01:50:34.490 --> 01:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
um and that means in my view
 
01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:37.129 align:start position:0%
um and that means in my view
self-determination

01:50:37.129 --> 01:50:37.139 align:start position:0%
self-determination
 
01:50:37.139 --> 01:50:38.629 align:start position:0%
self-determination
um

01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:41.930 --> 01:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
what the what choice they make what
 
01:50:44.689 --> 01:50:44.699 align:start position:0%
course they follow is up to them
 
01:50:47.810 --> 01:50:47.820 align:start position:0%
at least it should be
 
01:50:51.169 --> 01:50:51.179 align:start position:0%
and I hope that this this committee will
 
01:50:54.109 --> 01:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
recommend and this house will uh will
 
01:50:59.450 --> 01:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
also confirm uh that in the state of New
 
01:51:01.070 --> 01:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at least the New Hampshire
 
01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
house believes that it's time for the
 
01:51:08.090 --> 01:51:08.100 align:start position:0%
people of Puerto Rico to be able to say
 
01:51:10.490 --> 01:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
how they want to pursue their future
 
01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:12.950 align:start position:0%
how they want to pursue their future
self-determination

01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
self-determination
 
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico
 
01:51:19.250 --> 01:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
so that's why I'm hoping that that your
 
01:51:22.669 --> 01:51:22.679 align:start position:0%
this committee will will affirmatively
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
support HR 13. I'll be happy to answer
 
01:51:28.490 --> 01:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
any questions you might have
 
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
said Thank You representative let me
 
01:51:32.330 --> 01:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
start with one real quick and thank you
 
01:51:33.890 --> 01:51:33.900 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and for the
 
01:51:37.129 --> 01:51:37.139 align:start position:0%
resolution so as I read this
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
um the title has to do with affirming
 
01:51:42.109 --> 01:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
support for Puerto Rico
 
01:51:45.590 --> 01:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
um and online 26 and 27 uh it simply
 
01:51:48.250 --> 01:51:48.260 align:start position:0%
says that the and as you said
 
01:51:52.209 --> 01:51:52.219 align:start position:0%
it looks as I read this it's a
 
01:51:55.250 --> 01:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
declaration of support for the people in
 
01:51:56.689 --> 01:51:56.699 align:start position:0%
choosing how to best govern themselves
 
01:52:00.470 --> 01:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
in other words self-determination but it
 
01:52:02.990 --> 01:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
specifically mentions whether by whether
 
01:52:05.090 --> 01:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
by becoming a state or becoming
 
01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:06.410 align:start position:0%
by becoming a state or becoming
independent

01:52:06.410 --> 01:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
independent
 
01:52:09.770 --> 01:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
and the Puerto Rico currently is a
 
01:52:13.370 --> 01:52:13.380 align:start position:0%
commonwealth status so as I read this
 
01:52:16.669 --> 01:52:16.679 align:start position:0%
um am I to understand that the intent of
 
01:52:18.890 --> 01:52:18.900 align:start position:0%
the resolution is to let them have
 
01:52:21.970 --> 01:52:21.980 align:start position:0%
self-determination but precluding
 
01:52:24.649 --> 01:52:24.659 align:start position:0%
keeping the Commonwealth status
 
01:52:26.109 --> 01:52:26.119 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:52:29.149 --> 01:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
that choice is for the people of Puerto
 
01:52:32.090 --> 01:52:32.100 align:start position:0%
Rico whether they want to become a state
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
or they want to stay what they where
 
01:52:36.410 --> 01:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
what they are right now the Commonwealth
 
01:52:38.750 --> 01:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
that you were referenced Mr chairman uh
 
01:52:41.390 --> 01:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
whether they want to have enter into a
 
01:52:43.129 --> 01:52:43.139 align:start position:0%
compact for sovereignty in free
 
01:52:45.649 --> 01:52:45.659 align:start position:0%
association with the United States or to
 
01:52:47.629 --> 01:52:47.639 align:start position:0%
become an independent nation I don't
 
01:52:49.070 --> 01:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
know what the right answer to that is
 
01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
there is a right answer but it should be
 
01:52:53.810 --> 01:52:53.820 align:start position:0%
for the people of Puerto Rico to decide
 
01:52:57.050 --> 01:52:57.060 align:start position:0%
not for us to tell them in Beloved
 
01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
benevolent overlordship
 
01:53:03.890 --> 01:53:03.900 align:start position:0%
it's not for us it should be for them
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
question other questions representative
 
01:53:08.450 --> 01:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
Finney thank you I just wanted to know
 
01:53:10.970 --> 01:53:10.980 align:start position:0%
if they were to be incorporated as a
 
01:53:10.980 --> 01:53:11.810 align:start position:0%
if they were to be incorporated as a
state

01:53:11.810 --> 01:53:11.820 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
how many seats in Congress would they
 
01:53:16.729 --> 01:53:16.739 align:start position:0%
pick up one or two maybe I think there
 
01:53:18.709 --> 01:53:18.719 align:start position:0%
are something like four million people
 
01:53:20.709 --> 01:53:20.719 align:start position:0%
in Puerto Rico
 
01:53:25.129 --> 01:53:25.139 align:start position:0%
so you do the math uh we have two reps
 
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
with a million point three I would guess
 
01:53:30.169 --> 01:53:30.179 align:start position:0%
they they would have
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
five or six reps something like that
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
six times six times four is twenty four
 
01:53:38.450 --> 01:53:38.460 align:start position:0%
and so forth do the math I think there
 
01:53:42.050 --> 01:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
are about 700 000 people now per rep in
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
the United States six or seven hundred
 
01:53:46.189 --> 01:53:46.199 align:start position:0%
thousand so
 
01:53:49.850 --> 01:53:49.860 align:start position:0%
do that six times seven is forty two so
 
01:53:53.870 --> 01:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
they have about 4.2 million I think
 
01:53:57.770 --> 01:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
and two senators too of course
 
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
that that what you have basic Civics
 
01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
would involve two senators did I see
 
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
handle uh representative uh Judy did you
 
01:54:07.250 --> 01:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
have your hand up yes uh representative
 
01:54:09.169 --> 01:54:09.179 align:start position:0%
and then go first representative Judy
 
01:54:11.090 --> 01:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
and then representative gagne thank you
 
01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:54:15.770 --> 01:54:15.780 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to see you
 
01:54:18.590 --> 01:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
like always uh representative I would
 
01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
like to know exactly what happened to uh
 
01:54:24.050 --> 01:54:24.060 align:start position:0%
the economy of uh Puerto Rico
 
01:54:27.770 --> 01:54:27.780 align:start position:0%
because I I visit Puerto Rico twice
 
01:54:30.350 --> 01:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
but actually it's a beautiful Island
 
01:54:33.410 --> 01:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
and uh everything was settled at that
 
01:54:35.930 --> 01:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
time so what happened to the economy
 
01:54:37.850 --> 01:54:37.860 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:54:39.950 --> 01:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
I I'm not understanding your question
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
Gene uh can you take your mask off so I
 
01:54:46.070 --> 01:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
can hear you better no I told you
 
01:54:49.669 --> 01:54:49.679 align:start position:0%
um what happened to the economy in uh in
 
01:54:52.129 --> 01:54:52.139 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico because I visit Puerto Rico
 
01:54:54.850 --> 01:54:54.860 align:start position:0%
twice and I see it's a beautiful island
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
and uh I would like to know exactly uh
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
what happened to the economy
 
01:55:03.530 --> 01:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
well it certainly suffered enormously
 
01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
you can imagine a an economy that is
 
01:55:08.570 --> 01:55:08.580 align:start position:0%
fully dependent on electric power when
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
an electric power goes out and stays out
 
01:55:13.310 --> 01:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
in substantial portions of the of the
 
01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:14.270 align:start position:0%
in substantial portions of the of the
area

01:55:14.270 --> 01:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:55:16.430 --> 01:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
they go back to the not the Stone Age
 
01:55:19.850 --> 01:55:19.860 align:start position:0%
but to go back to the 1600s because
 
01:55:22.189 --> 01:55:22.199 align:start position:0%
uh they don't have they don't have
 
01:55:24.830 --> 01:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
electric power so economically they
 
01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
suffered greatly as well as losing some
 
01:55:31.070 --> 01:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
three to three thousand people in the
 
01:55:33.169 --> 01:55:33.179 align:start position:0%
hurricane so and they're still they're
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
still suffering
 
01:55:37.250 --> 01:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
the the Reconstruction of Puerto Rico
 
01:55:39.770 --> 01:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
lags considerably
 
01:55:42.590 --> 01:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we know how the this
 
01:55:45.770 --> 01:55:45.780 align:start position:0%
country can get behind its citizens when
 
01:55:49.189 --> 01:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
Houston was flooded so dramatically by a
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
previous hurricane uh the it was
 
01:55:54.590 --> 01:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
declared a disaster area by the
 
01:55:58.430 --> 01:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
president and the for the the resources
 
01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
of the American people were greatly
 
01:56:02.930 --> 01:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
focused on getting Houston back into a
 
01:56:05.390 --> 01:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
viable situation and the same way with
 
01:56:07.729 --> 01:56:07.739 align:start position:0%
his awful hurricane in Florida and so
 
01:56:10.129 --> 01:56:10.139 align:start position:0%
forth working diligently to try to get
 
01:56:12.050 --> 01:56:12.060 align:start position:0%
them back into a decent position
 
01:56:12.060 --> 01:56:13.750 align:start position:0%
them back into a decent position
condition

01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
condition
 
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
including economically uh and I don't we
 
01:56:20.270 --> 01:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the same kind of uh effort
 
01:56:23.209 --> 01:56:23.219 align:start position:0%
in Puerto Rico even though there are
 
01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:32.450 --> 01:56:32.460 align:start position:0%
representative Gabby
 
01:56:34.370 --> 01:56:34.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman this could be a
 
01:56:36.410 --> 01:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
question for you sir uh
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
which bill which house resolution paper
 
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
are we looking at the original bill or
 
01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment okay so I brought you the
 
01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.010 align:start position:0%
the amendment okay so I brought you the
amendment

01:56:46.010 --> 01:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:56:48.350 --> 01:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
uh and every one of you has a copy of it
 
01:56:52.010 --> 01:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
in for in front of you uh and there were
 
01:56:55.310 --> 01:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
there were two two deficiencies in the
 
01:56:59.149 --> 01:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
original resolution as uh as it landed
 
01:57:01.930 --> 01:57:01.940 align:start position:0%
on your desks one of them referenced a
 
01:57:05.810 --> 01:57:05.820 align:start position:0%
1917 election which I'm reliably
 
01:57:08.510 --> 01:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
informed did not happen so that language
 
01:57:11.810 --> 01:57:11.820 align:start position:0%
has been stricken because uh uh because
 
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
I've been told that that never happened
 
01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
and this that's a misleading statement
 
01:57:19.970 --> 01:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
uh and the other change was that it only
 
01:57:23.629 --> 01:57:23.639 align:start position:0%
had just uh either a vote for Statehood
 
01:57:26.810 --> 01:57:26.820 align:start position:0%
or becoming an independent nation but
 
01:57:29.570 --> 01:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
the third one entering into line 27
 
01:57:31.850 --> 01:57:31.860 align:start position:0%
entering into a compact for sovereignty
 
01:57:33.709 --> 01:57:33.719 align:start position:0%
and free association with the United
 
01:57:36.470 --> 01:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
States and those those are just three
 
01:57:40.430 --> 01:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
possibilities but whatever whatever
 
01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
choice they make it should be for them
 
01:57:45.530 --> 01:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
that's that's the thrust of my house
 
01:57:45.540 --> 01:57:46.430 align:start position:0%
that's that's the thrust of my house
resolution

01:57:46.430 --> 01:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
01:57:49.490 --> 01:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
is to have self-determination for the
 
01:57:52.669 --> 01:57:52.679 align:start position:0%
people of Puerto Rico thank you
 
01:57:55.850 --> 01:57:55.860 align:start position:0%
uh represent pimonte
 
01:57:57.530 --> 01:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:57:59.930 --> 01:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
um have other legislatures in the
 
01:58:04.129 --> 01:58:04.139 align:start position:0%
country put in similar resolutions do
 
01:58:05.209 --> 01:58:05.219 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:58:07.550 --> 01:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
I believe that's the case I also believe
 
01:58:11.689 --> 01:58:11.699 align:start position:0%
that the Congress is taking action in
 
01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
this regard as well but I I would like
 
01:58:17.169 --> 01:58:17.179 align:start position:0%
to see New Hampshire go on the record uh
 
01:58:20.750 --> 01:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
in support of our fellow American
 
01:58:25.490 --> 01:58:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:27.770 --> 01:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your attention for
 
01:58:32.689 --> 01:58:32.699 align:start position:0%

01:58:37.490 --> 01:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
for the first time

Cena thank you so much representative
 
01:58:42.950 --> 01:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
Schmidt and I just a comment uh when
 
01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
President Ford left office in 1977 after
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
uh the election he came out in in
 
01:58:54.169 --> 01:58:54.179 align:start position:0%
publicly advocated for Statehood for uh
 
01:58:57.970 --> 01:58:57.980 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico in 1977
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
so I always remembered that
 
01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:02.570 align:start position:0%
so I always remembered that
um

01:59:02.570 --> 01:59:02.580 align:start position:0%

problem

01:59:23.330 --> 01:59:23.340 align:start position:0%

encourage my colleagues to ask Carlos
 
01:59:44.209 --> 01:59:44.219 align:start position:0%
some of the same questions that they
 
01:59:46.669 --> 01:59:46.679 align:start position:0%
just asked representative Schmidt as he
 
01:59:49.129 --> 01:59:49.139 align:start position:0%
is from Puerto Rico and can really speak
 
01:59:51.950 --> 01:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
to this issue as well
 
02:00:02.470 --> 02:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%

02:00:07.010 --> 02:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Representatives ladies and
 
02:00:09.169 --> 02:00:09.179 align:start position:0%
gentlemen my name is Carlos Cardona I
 
02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
was born in nagada Puerto Rico I
 
02:00:13.129 --> 02:00:13.139 align:start position:0%
actually live in Laconia New Hampshire
 
02:00:15.229 --> 02:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
I've called Laconia for the past 15
 
02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
years my home I consider New Hampshire
 
02:00:20.030 --> 02:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
to be my home I'm Granite Stater like
 
02:00:22.850 --> 02:00:22.860 align:start position:0%
everybody else but for the past 15 years
 
02:00:26.030 --> 02:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
I've also used this amazing Traditions
 
02:00:27.050 --> 02:00:27.060 align:start position:0%
that we have here in New Hampshire
 
02:00:29.149 --> 02:00:29.159 align:start position:0%
called the first in the nation to
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
advocate for my home Island archipelago
 
02:00:33.530 --> 02:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico is comprised
 
02:00:35.330 --> 02:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
of actually many islands it's not just
 
02:00:37.970 --> 02:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
one big island like people think there
 
02:00:39.950 --> 02:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
are other islands with residents in it
 
02:00:42.709 --> 02:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
about the size of Saint Thomas and the
 
02:00:44.450 --> 02:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
Virgin Islands and I think most people
 
02:00:46.490 --> 02:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
forget that because they travel to
 
02:00:48.229 --> 02:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico they go to San Juan they see
 
02:00:51.050 --> 02:00:51.060 align:start position:0%
the Fortress and they say beautiful but
 
02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
they often forget the 3 million Puerto
 
02:00:55.070 --> 02:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
Ricans that live outside of the island
 
02:00:57.950 --> 02:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
that oftentimes get forgotten including
 
02:01:00.050 --> 02:01:00.060 align:start position:0%
in the last Administration that three
 
02:01:01.850 --> 02:01:01.860 align:start position:0%
million Puerto Ricans were left out with
 
02:01:04.189 --> 02:01:04.199 align:start position:0%
no paid no support
 
02:01:06.589 --> 02:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
originally I should say I had to post
 
02:01:09.169 --> 02:01:09.179 align:start position:0%
the original bill that had come before
 
02:01:12.530 --> 02:01:12.540 align:start position:0%
you guys I support the amendment I
 
02:01:14.330 --> 02:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
believe that the original Bill had
 
02:01:15.830 --> 02:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
really good intentions but it had some
 
02:01:17.030 --> 02:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
misinformation but I believe
 
02:01:18.770 --> 02:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt has put in the
 
02:01:21.229 --> 02:01:21.239 align:start position:0%
work and I want to thank him personally
 
02:01:23.870 --> 02:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
for honoring our people and making sure
 
02:01:26.330 --> 02:01:26.340 align:start position:0%
that our voices were heard so I wanted
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
to say that but I also wanted to
 
02:01:29.149 --> 02:01:29.159 align:start position:0%
acknowledge some of the questions that
 
02:01:31.129 --> 02:01:31.139 align:start position:0%
popped up but if you have questions as I
 
02:01:32.810 --> 02:01:32.820 align:start position:0%
speak I'm happy to answer those I want
 
02:01:34.070 --> 02:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
to be available to you and any
 
02:01:37.310 --> 02:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
experience that I may have had and I'll
 
02:01:39.169 --> 02:01:39.179 align:start position:0%
just read what I have here for you sorry
 
02:01:42.050 --> 02:01:42.060 align:start position:0%
a little nervous
 
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
um I also serve I should add that I
 
02:01:46.129 --> 02:01:46.139 align:start position:0%
serve I'm an appointed member from
 
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
sununu on the New Hampshire Commission
 
02:01:49.850 --> 02:01:49.860 align:start position:0%
on Native American Affairs I belong to
 
02:01:52.129 --> 02:01:52.139 align:start position:0%
the tribe of higuajawa I am not here to
 
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
speak on their behalf but I do think
 
02:01:55.729 --> 02:01:55.739 align:start position:0%
that my experience and my Heritage and
 
02:01:59.030 --> 02:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
my ancestors have a lot to say on these
 
02:02:01.370 --> 02:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
topics that you're discussing today and
 
02:02:02.330 --> 02:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
I believe that there was a question
 
02:02:05.089 --> 02:02:05.099 align:start position:0%
earlier whether other states have
 
02:02:07.010 --> 02:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
proposed such bill I believe that
 
02:02:08.689 --> 02:02:08.699 align:start position:0%
Florida and Texas are the only two
 
02:02:11.570 --> 02:02:11.580 align:start position:0%
states that currently have some sort of
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
resolution uh cooking but nothing that
 
02:02:16.669 --> 02:02:16.679 align:start position:0%
is actually before their state houses
 
02:02:18.770 --> 02:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
but I do believe that New Hampshire is
 
02:02:20.450 --> 02:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
being first in the nation and politics
 
02:02:22.189 --> 02:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
being so important to this day I think
 
02:02:23.570 --> 02:02:23.580 align:start position:0%
it is important that the state of New
 
02:02:26.270 --> 02:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire be first to say that they
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
support the Puerto Rican people in
 
02:02:29.930 --> 02:02:29.940 align:start position:0%
self-determining I think it's also very
 
02:02:31.609 --> 02:02:31.619 align:start position:0%
important that we as people that live in
 
02:02:33.950 --> 02:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire including myself that we
 
02:02:35.930 --> 02:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
are careful not to go down the road of
 
02:02:38.330 --> 02:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
telling Puerto Ricans once more what to
 
02:02:40.609 --> 02:02:40.619 align:start position:0%
do with their lives Puerto Ricans have
 
02:02:42.530 --> 02:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
never had a say under citizenship they
 
02:02:47.209 --> 02:02:47.219 align:start position:0%
were invaded by the an Imperial Crown of
 
02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
Spain in the 1800s well 1600s into the
 
02:02:52.910 --> 02:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
1800s and then of course the American
 
02:02:55.490 --> 02:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
Spanish War happened Puerto Rican sided
 
02:02:57.229 --> 02:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
with the United States in the island
 
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
during the Spanish-American war with the
 
02:03:01.910 --> 02:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
promise and intention that Puerto Rico
 
02:03:04.189 --> 02:03:04.199 align:start position:0%
would be independent that someday they
 
02:03:05.870 --> 02:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
would live to their fullest potential
 
02:03:08.990 --> 02:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
that potential never came that promise
 
02:03:12.169 --> 02:03:12.179 align:start position:0%
never happened Puerto Rico has never had
 
02:03:16.189 --> 02:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
to say to determine their future to this
 
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
day there's actually a gentile that
 
02:03:19.370 --> 02:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
decides the finances of the island of
 
02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico so 3 million Puerto Ricans
 
02:03:24.169 --> 02:03:24.179 align:start position:0%
two times and a half larger than New
 
02:03:24.179 --> 02:03:25.310 align:start position:0%
two times and a half larger than New
Hampshire

02:03:25.310 --> 02:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:03:27.290 --> 02:03:27.300 align:start position:0%
ajanta gets to tell them how to spend
 
02:03:29.030 --> 02:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
their taxes imagine if that happened
 
02:03:31.070 --> 02:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:03:33.229 --> 02:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
I know that we would all be protesting
 
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
there would be no question about it just
 
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
like we're Live Free or Die Puerto Rico
 
02:03:40.850 --> 02:03:40.860 align:start position:0%
has a very similar motto we believe that
 
02:03:43.370 --> 02:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
we should have a self-determination
 
02:03:46.490 --> 02:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
that said current data and statuses do
 
02:03:48.649 --> 02:03:48.659 align:start position:0%
show that Puerto Rico has been in recent
 
02:03:50.870 --> 02:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
memory in favor of statehood but I still
 
02:03:53.390 --> 02:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
because I am the only Puerto Rican here
 
02:03:56.510 --> 02:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
in this room as far as I know I feel
 
02:03:58.310 --> 02:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
that is my duty to make sure that I
 
02:04:00.770 --> 02:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
represent all voices of the island
 
02:04:02.930 --> 02:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
and I I consider that a huge privilege
 
02:04:04.669 --> 02:04:04.679 align:start position:0%
and honor I will not take it for granted
 
02:04:07.010 --> 02:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
so right now currently the island splits
 
02:04:10.609 --> 02:04:10.619 align:start position:0%
25 Pro statehood 25 Sovereign but free
 
02:04:12.910 --> 02:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
Alliance to the United States 25
 
02:04:15.410 --> 02:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
pro-independents and 25 don't care don't
 
02:04:15.420 --> 02:04:17.330 align:start position:0%
pro-independents and 25 don't care don't
know

02:04:17.330 --> 02:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:04:20.810 --> 02:04:20.820 align:start position:0%
um so that's some of the data that has
 
02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
for Puerto Rico I also want to take this
 
02:04:24.890 --> 02:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
moment I wouldn't be myself if I didn't
 
02:04:27.229 --> 02:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
take the time to honor the 3000 Plus
 
02:04:28.910 --> 02:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
Puerto Ricans that died during Hurricane
 
02:04:31.550 --> 02:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
Maria and actually I have lived I was
 
02:04:33.169 --> 02:04:33.179 align:start position:0%
born during Hurricane Hugo on the island
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
there was no electricity my mom was
 
02:04:36.589 --> 02:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
forced to give birth with no electricity
 
02:04:39.649 --> 02:04:39.659 align:start position:0%
no water no medicine so imagine the
 
02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
women in this committee well they would
 
02:04:42.709 --> 02:04:42.719 align:start position:0%
that would be like especially if you've
 
02:04:46.010 --> 02:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
had a child I was born during those very
 
02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
terrible situations actually my family
 
02:04:50.089 --> 02:04:50.099 align:start position:0%
had to ration food for seven months
 
02:04:51.890 --> 02:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
during that hurricane just to be able to
 
02:04:53.930 --> 02:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
make sure that we survive during
 
02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
Hurricane Maria was 10 times worse the
 
02:04:57.890 --> 02:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
Puerto the Puerto Rican people were
 
02:05:01.609 --> 02:05:01.619 align:start position:0%
forced for nine months with no help no
 
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
running water no electricity I actually
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
happened to be one of those statistics I
 
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
lost my uncle Tio Oli LeBron LeBron
 
02:05:10.910 --> 02:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
during the hurricane he actually
 
02:05:13.609 --> 02:05:13.619 align:start position:0%
committed suicide because there was no
 
02:05:15.950 --> 02:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
water no food no electricity there was
 
02:05:19.550 --> 02:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
no help just trees flat fruit rotting in
 
02:05:21.649 --> 02:05:21.659 align:start position:0%
the ground animals dying it was
 
02:05:22.970 --> 02:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
literally what you would see in a
 
02:05:25.310 --> 02:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
Resident Evil movie of the Apocalypse I
 
02:05:27.050 --> 02:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
had received photos nine months after it
 
02:05:29.149 --> 02:05:29.159 align:start position:0%
happened so you can understand I talked
 
02:05:30.890 --> 02:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
to my father every single day in the
 
02:05:30.900 --> 02:05:31.729 align:start position:0%
to my father every single day in the
island

02:05:31.729 --> 02:05:31.739 align:start position:0%
island
 
02:05:33.649 --> 02:05:33.659 align:start position:0%
I went nine months without hearing from
 
02:05:35.689 --> 02:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
him I had picture the worst my dad was
 
02:05:37.490 --> 02:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
in the hospital for seven months and in
 
02:05:40.729 --> 02:05:40.739 align:start position:0%
ICU he drank bad water and was poisoned
 
02:05:43.450 --> 02:05:43.460 align:start position:0%
because of rat pissed in the water
 
02:05:45.890 --> 02:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
something that antibiotics here in New
 
02:05:48.290 --> 02:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would cure within 24 hours he
 
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
didn't have access to that so I do think
 
02:05:53.089 --> 02:05:53.099 align:start position:0%
due to put to the American policy on
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico like the Jones actor which
 
02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
it was implemented in 1917.
 
02:05:59.629 --> 02:05:59.639 align:start position:0%
um that is the consequences that have
 
02:06:01.370 --> 02:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
happened and I do believe that those
 
02:06:03.530 --> 02:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
deaths are because of inaction and
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
irresponsibility to the US government
 
02:06:07.790 --> 02:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
that said I am living the American dream
 
02:06:09.890 --> 02:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
I'm a business owner I have a family I'm
 
02:06:11.510 --> 02:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
raising two children with my partner
 
02:06:13.790 --> 02:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
John and Laconia I love the United
 
02:06:16.430 --> 02:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
States just like all of you I consider
 
02:06:18.290 --> 02:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
myself very patriotic and I want what's
 
02:06:19.910 --> 02:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
best for our country just like I want
 
02:06:22.490 --> 02:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
what's best for Puerto Rico so in this
 
02:06:24.109 --> 02:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
case I do believe that as New Hampshire
 
02:06:25.970 --> 02:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
rights or Granite Staters it is our
 
02:06:28.490 --> 02:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
responsibility to speak up and stand
 
02:06:30.649 --> 02:06:30.659 align:start position:0%
behind people that have been serving I
 
02:06:32.030 --> 02:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
also thought that it'll be interesting
 
02:06:33.890 --> 02:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
to provide you a quick little fun fact
 
02:06:35.689 --> 02:06:35.699 align:start position:0%
that I didn't know I learned while
 
02:06:38.089 --> 02:06:38.099 align:start position:0%
researching my own Island Lieutenant
 
02:06:40.970 --> 02:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
Coronel theophilo and barswatch was the
 
02:06:43.310 --> 02:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
first shot during World War One
 
02:06:45.530 --> 02:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
so Puerto Ricans have been serving in
 
02:06:47.209 --> 02:06:47.219 align:start position:0%
the united in the United States armed
 
02:06:49.370 --> 02:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
forces since World War one and it was a
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rican that shot the first shot so
 
02:06:54.229 --> 02:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
if you think about it everything that we
 
02:06:56.270 --> 02:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
believe in today in our democratic
 
02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
system was because one Puerto Rican was
 
02:07:00.890 --> 02:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
brave enough to do the first shot and
 
02:07:03.169 --> 02:07:03.179 align:start position:0%
actually there's a a little story in the
 
02:07:04.490 --> 02:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
island of Puerto Rico that there was a
 
02:07:05.689 --> 02:07:05.699 align:start position:0%
discussion who was going to do that
 
02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
first shot and he without a second
 
02:07:11.149 --> 02:07:11.159 align:start position:0%
thought said I will he was willing to
 
02:07:13.669 --> 02:07:13.679 align:start position:0%
sacrifice his life for you and me
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
without a thought
 
02:07:17.330 --> 02:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
so I believe that today is the right
 
02:07:19.609 --> 02:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
time to stand up for Puerto Rico just
 
02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
like they didn't have a second thought
 
02:07:24.229 --> 02:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
about fighting for us we should have no
 
02:07:26.270 --> 02:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
second thought for following up with a
 
02:07:28.250 --> 02:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
promise that we made them
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
another fun fact in World War II Navy
 
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant Maria Rodriguez Denton born
 
02:07:35.570 --> 02:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
in guanica Puerto Rico became the first
 
02:07:37.850 --> 02:07:37.860 align:start position:0%
known women of Puerto Rican descent to
 
02:07:40.430 --> 02:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
become a female Navy officer
 
02:07:41.810 --> 02:07:41.820 align:start position:0%
you know when you think about women's
 
02:07:43.850 --> 02:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
rights in this country and the pivotal
 
02:07:45.709 --> 02:07:45.719 align:start position:0%
times that we're living
 
02:07:48.649 --> 02:07:48.659 align:start position:0%
it was a Puerto Rican woman that was
 
02:07:52.129 --> 02:07:52.139 align:start position:0%
willing once again to fight for us and
 
02:07:54.169 --> 02:07:54.179 align:start position:0%
willing to call you know to answer the
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
call to duty
 
02:07:57.410 --> 02:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
I have never served in the military and
 
02:07:58.910 --> 02:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to pretend that I have any
 
02:08:01.250 --> 02:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
courage that they have but if I was to
 
02:08:03.530 --> 02:08:03.540 align:start position:0%
be just even have an ounce of the
 
02:08:05.209 --> 02:08:05.219 align:start position:0%
courage that that woman had
 
02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
it is today to speak before you and all
 
02:08:09.530 --> 02:08:09.540 align:start position:0%
white mostly white board with the
 
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:11.760 align:start position:0%

02:08:58.189 --> 02:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
intent of it is to support the Puerto
 
02:09:00.669 --> 02:09:00.679 align:start position:0%
Rican people in their choice for
 
02:09:03.950 --> 02:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
self-determination and there is he
 
02:09:07.030 --> 02:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned you gave some statistics of uh
 
02:09:09.649 --> 02:09:09.659 align:start position:0%
percentages who lean one way or the
 
02:09:11.810 --> 02:09:11.820 align:start position:0%
other so I just want to understand do
 
02:09:14.570 --> 02:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
you yourself have a particular uh choice
 
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of what course the Puerto
 
02:09:18.970 --> 02:09:18.980 align:start position:0%
Ricans would take or or you simply
 
02:09:21.229 --> 02:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
supporting the resolution for
 
02:09:21.239 --> 02:09:23.030 align:start position:0%
supporting the resolution for
self-determination

02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
self-determination
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
I I believe myself to be a resident of
 
02:09:27.530 --> 02:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire I pay taxes
 
02:09:29.450 --> 02:09:29.460 align:start position:0%
here and I don't think I have any right
 
02:09:31.310 --> 02:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
to tell just as much as any of you don't
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
have a right to tell the people of
 
02:09:35.089 --> 02:09:35.099 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico what to do I believe that
 
02:09:37.070 --> 02:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
for the past 15 years I have invested
 
02:09:38.450 --> 02:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
more in the state of New Hampshire than
 
02:09:40.189 --> 02:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
I have in my own Island so I don't think
 
02:09:42.290 --> 02:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
that I have the right to tell Puerto
 
02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
Rico how to vote just like any of us
 
02:09:45.950 --> 02:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a right to tell Texans
 
02:09:47.810 --> 02:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
what to do or California or whatever
 
02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
state I do believe in individual state
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
rights and I believe that Puerto Rico
 
02:09:53.570 --> 02:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
should have its own self-determination
 
02:09:55.850 --> 02:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm here for but I will tell
 
02:09:59.089 --> 02:09:59.099 align:start position:0%
you Puerto Rico is very different than
 
02:10:01.250 --> 02:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
the rest of the United States I think we
 
02:10:02.810 --> 02:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
would be kidding ourselves if we said
 
02:10:04.970 --> 02:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
that we were very much alike I think the
 
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
only thing that we really have alike is
 
02:10:07.970 --> 02:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
the fact that we both courageous and
 
02:10:11.089 --> 02:10:11.099 align:start position:0%
patriotic to our people but Puerto Rico
 
02:10:12.770 --> 02:10:12.780 align:start position:0%
speaks a different language Puerto Rico
 
02:10:15.709 --> 02:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
has a different culture and I as a higua
 
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
yawan I am concerned that by becoming a
 
02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:20.689 align:start position:0%
yawan I am concerned that by becoming a
state

02:10:20.689 --> 02:10:20.699 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:10:23.209 --> 02:10:23.219 align:start position:0%
part of our culture would die that could
 
02:10:24.770 --> 02:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
be false that could be true I mean New
 
02:10:26.089 --> 02:10:26.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has even though it's part of
 
02:10:27.770 --> 02:10:27.780 align:start position:0%
the United States it has kept a strong
 
02:10:30.109 --> 02:10:30.119 align:start position:0%
independent streak it has become as it's
 
02:10:32.810 --> 02:10:32.820 align:start position:0%
capped as courage and his it's it's Live
 
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
Free or Die motto
 
02:10:36.649 --> 02:10:36.659 align:start position:0%
but that has not been the case for
 
02:10:38.930 --> 02:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
Hawaii for example you know Hawaii has
 
02:10:40.669 --> 02:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
been an island that has suffered a lot
 
02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
under statehood so my personal belief
 
02:10:45.890 --> 02:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
and which is very public I have been
 
02:10:47.450 --> 02:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
very public since I've lived here in the
 
02:10:48.770 --> 02:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I do believe that
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
the third option for Puerto Rico is the
 
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
most viable one and the best and most
 
02:10:53.810 --> 02:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
responsible for the both the United
 
02:10:56.810 --> 02:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
States and Puerto Rico which is a
 
02:10:59.149 --> 02:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
self-sovereign state with an alliance to
 
02:11:01.070 --> 02:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
the United States one of my biggest
 
02:11:02.990 --> 02:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
concern and I think it's a concern to
 
02:11:05.290 --> 02:11:05.300 align:start position:0%
many people especially of latinx
 
02:11:08.450 --> 02:11:08.460 align:start position:0%
background is that we don't want Puerto
 
02:11:10.609 --> 02:11:10.619 align:start position:0%
Rico to become another Cuba
 
02:11:12.649 --> 02:11:12.659 align:start position:0%
where for example the government might
 
02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
be hostile to the United States or worst
 
02:11:17.149 --> 02:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
off which is my case I wouldn't want to
 
02:11:19.070 --> 02:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
not ever see my homeland again or not
 
02:11:21.709 --> 02:11:21.719 align:start position:0%
see my people I have 34 cousins seven
 
02:11:24.290 --> 02:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
aunts and uncles my father my cousin
 
02:11:26.089 --> 02:11:26.099 align:start position:0%
happens to be mayor of my hometown I
 
02:11:27.530 --> 02:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
would love to see these people I see
 
02:11:30.410 --> 02:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
them twice a year if Puerto Rico became
 
02:11:31.729 --> 02:11:31.739 align:start position:0%
a sovereign state where the Hostile
 
02:11:33.589 --> 02:11:33.599 align:start position:0%
whether there was hostility with Puerto
 
02:11:35.149 --> 02:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
Rico in the United States of course that
 
02:11:36.890 --> 02:11:36.900 align:start position:0%
would mean no travel for me back home
 
02:11:38.930 --> 02:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
and that would be something that I would
 
02:11:41.330 --> 02:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
be very painful for me to live with so
 
02:11:43.129 --> 02:11:43.139 align:start position:0%
while I'm not opposed to statehood if it
 
02:11:44.270 --> 02:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
became a statehood I would be a
 
02:11:45.770 --> 02:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
hypocrite to be against it just because
 
02:11:47.390 --> 02:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
I am here living in the states and I
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
take full advantage of the privilege of
 
02:11:51.589 --> 02:11:51.599 align:start position:0%
being an American citizen and I wish
 
02:11:53.330 --> 02:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
nothing but the best for my people so I
 
02:11:54.830 --> 02:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
would support it but again I'm here
 
02:11:56.510 --> 02:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
mostly to support the will of Puerto
 
02:11:58.910 --> 02:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
Rico and just the hunger for them to
 
02:12:00.830 --> 02:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
have a democratic system Puerto Rico
 
02:12:02.030 --> 02:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
while they have elections for their
 
02:12:03.649 --> 02:12:03.659 align:start position:0%
Governors and their senators and their
 
02:12:05.689 --> 02:12:05.699 align:start position:0%
representatives like we do here they
 
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
have no Financial say in their economic
 
02:12:10.490 --> 02:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
system their schools their
 
02:12:12.229 --> 02:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
infrastructure with Peter Smith
 
02:12:14.930 --> 02:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
representative Peter Schmidt alluded to
 
02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
earlier about the infrastructure you
 
02:12:18.709 --> 02:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
know it's collapsing because their
 
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
people have no say the person that has a
 
02:12:22.370 --> 02:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
say is a person that lives here in the
 
02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
United States of America and has no idea
 
02:12:28.129 --> 02:12:28.139 align:start position:0%
what living like down there is and I
 
02:12:29.149 --> 02:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
believe some of the representatives in
 
02:12:30.530 --> 02:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
this committee have been to the island
 
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
so they can probably attest to the
 
02:12:35.030 --> 02:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure the potholes which
 
02:12:36.290 --> 02:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
they're common here but they don't have
 
02:12:38.589 --> 02:12:38.599 align:start position:0%
winter so keep that in mind
 
02:12:41.270 --> 02:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
and you of course you know the the
 
02:12:44.109 --> 02:12:44.119 align:start position:0%
outdated electricity and phone service
 
02:12:46.070 --> 02:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest mistakes during
 
02:12:47.450 --> 02:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
Hurricane Maria was the cell phone
 
02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
towers came down because there were like
 
02:12:50.950 --> 02:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
20 30 years old
 
02:12:53.689 --> 02:12:53.699 align:start position:0%
that's going to continue to happen the
 
02:12:56.890 --> 02:12:56.900 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is being mandated and
 
02:12:59.270 --> 02:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
directed actually the person that was
 
02:13:01.250 --> 02:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
contracted from Luma which is for the
 
02:13:02.750 --> 02:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
electricity private companies from
 
02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:03.830 align:start position:0%
electricity private companies from
Canada

02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
Canada
 
02:13:06.050 --> 02:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
so think that for that for a second you
 
02:13:08.870 --> 02:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
imagine us hiring somebody from South
 
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
America to come and tell you guys us
 
02:13:13.609 --> 02:13:13.619 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire how to build our
 
02:13:15.169 --> 02:13:15.179 align:start position:0%
roads and how to build our electricity
 
02:13:18.530 --> 02:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and uh representative
 
02:13:28.069 --> 02:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:31.550 --> 02:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
testimony my question for you is
 
02:13:33.530 --> 02:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
do you think
 
02:13:35.810 --> 02:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
you gave an overview of some of the
 
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
unjust imperialism that has sadly
 
02:13:40.490 --> 02:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
plagued the island do you think this
 
02:13:44.089 --> 02:13:44.099 align:start position:0%
resolution would be a step in the right
 
02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
direction towards making amends for that
 
02:13:51.050 --> 02:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
unjust Imperial public policy it will be
 
02:13:52.910 --> 02:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
a cost free
 
02:13:55.129 --> 02:13:55.139 align:start position:0%
way to start amending our relationship
 
02:13:57.410 --> 02:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
with the people of Puerto Rico I think
 
02:13:58.729 --> 02:13:58.739 align:start position:0%
the people of Puerto Rico for many
 
02:14:00.890 --> 02:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
generations have shown their will to be
 
02:14:02.930 --> 02:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
helpful to the United States not only by
 
02:14:05.930 --> 02:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
serving in Wars but in research I don't
 
02:14:07.310 --> 02:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
know if you knew but Puerto Rico for the
 
02:14:09.109 --> 02:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
longest time had the largest satellite
 
02:14:11.209 --> 02:14:11.219 align:start position:0%
in the world that did a lot of research
 
02:14:13.129 --> 02:14:13.139 align:start position:0%
for the United States and aracivo which
 
02:14:15.109 --> 02:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
recently sadly enough was destroyed
 
02:14:17.450 --> 02:14:17.460 align:start position:0%
because of hurricane Maria
 
02:14:20.209 --> 02:14:20.219 align:start position:0%
the United States I think should have in
 
02:14:22.010 --> 02:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
return said we'll rebuild the satellite
 
02:14:24.229 --> 02:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
instead we said no we're not going to
 
02:14:26.390 --> 02:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
but I think this is a good way to start
 
02:14:28.250 --> 02:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
amending that relationship and showing
 
02:14:30.890 --> 02:14:30.900 align:start position:0%
some good will and not only that I also
 
02:14:32.510 --> 02:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
want to mention which I forgot there are
 
02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:33.410 align:start position:0%
want to mention which I forgot there are
17

02:14:33.410 --> 02:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
17
 
02:14:35.330 --> 02:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
000 Puerto Ricans here in the state of
 
02:14:36.530 --> 02:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that have moved here
 
02:14:38.649 --> 02:14:38.659 align:start position:0%
during since hurricane Maria
 
02:14:41.450 --> 02:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
contributing to our economy that
 
02:14:43.729 --> 02:14:43.739 align:start position:0%
happened because of businessmen like the
 
02:14:46.069 --> 02:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
the owner of the common man who has been
 
02:14:47.990 --> 02:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
recruiting people from Puerto Rico who
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
speak English to come here and help out
 
02:14:52.250 --> 02:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
with the jobs all of you know that in
 
02:14:53.750 --> 02:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
your communities I'm in Laconia I'm a
 
02:14:55.129 --> 02:14:55.139 align:start position:0%
business owner I used to have 200
 
02:14:57.530 --> 02:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
employees I have 50 right now
 
02:14:59.390 --> 02:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
so Puerto Ricans are a great
 
02:15:01.729 --> 02:15:01.739 align:start position:0%
contributors to our economy here in the
 
02:15:03.229 --> 02:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and especially to
 
02:15:04.790 --> 02:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
business owners that are struggling to
 
02:15:07.010 --> 02:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
hire today so this is a good way to send
 
02:15:08.930 --> 02:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
them a signal saying we see you you
 
02:15:10.430 --> 02:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
might not be the biggest minority
 
02:15:12.350 --> 02:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
population in the state but we
 
02:15:14.149 --> 02:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate and it's a cost-free one it
 
02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't cost us anything except our time
 
02:15:18.709 --> 02:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for that
 
02:15:21.649 --> 02:15:21.659 align:start position:0%
question representative uh thank you I'm
 
02:15:22.790 --> 02:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
not going to see you here in pretend I
 
02:15:24.350 --> 02:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
know anything about Puerto Rico so I
 
02:15:26.330 --> 02:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
appreciate the information
 
02:15:27.890 --> 02:15:27.900 align:start position:0%
um so in saying that economically
 
02:15:29.750 --> 02:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
speaking or politically I do I do agree
 
02:15:31.729 --> 02:15:31.739 align:start position:0%
with you economically speaking I'm I'm
 
02:15:33.470 --> 02:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
wondering if they were to be
 
02:15:35.450 --> 02:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
incorporated as a state they would then
 
02:15:37.729 --> 02:15:37.739 align:start position:0%
be subject to our tax structure if they
 
02:15:39.229 --> 02:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
were an independent state they'd have
 
02:15:42.229 --> 02:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to to enter in any
 
02:15:44.689 --> 02:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
um economic compact they wanted with we
 
02:15:46.729 --> 02:15:46.739 align:start position:0%
know with other countries do you think
 
02:15:48.290 --> 02:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
it's more economically viable for them
 
02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
to stay part of the United States or to
 
02:15:52.790 --> 02:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
be independent to build up their own
 
02:15:54.709 --> 02:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
economy on their own terms yeah I mean
 
02:15:56.750 --> 02:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
that I have a couple of answers for that
 
02:15:58.189 --> 02:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
and I hope you guys can be patient with
 
02:16:00.890 --> 02:16:00.900 align:start position:0%
me as I translated it in my head
 
02:16:00.900 --> 02:16:01.550 align:start position:0%
me as I translated it in my head
um

02:16:01.550 --> 02:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:04.310 --> 02:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
so I do think it's economic of
 
02:16:06.109 --> 02:16:06.119 align:start position:0%
economically feasible but I have to be
 
02:16:07.669 --> 02:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
honest if Puerto Rico became a state
 
02:16:09.470 --> 02:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
tomorrow it would be the poorest state
 
02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
in the nation poorer than Alabama and
 
02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:12.290 align:start position:0%
in the nation poorer than Alabama and
Mississippi

02:16:12.290 --> 02:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
Mississippi
 
02:16:14.270 --> 02:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
that said that doesn't stop us from
 
02:16:17.209 --> 02:16:17.219 align:start position:0%
loving Mississippi more or less I think
 
02:16:18.890 --> 02:16:18.900 align:start position:0%
we see them just as part of the Union as
 
02:16:20.750 --> 02:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
any other state so I don't think that's
 
02:16:22.550 --> 02:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
how we should look at this but that said
 
02:16:24.109 --> 02:16:24.119 align:start position:0%
to answer your question honestly would
 
02:16:25.250 --> 02:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
be the poorest state in the country
 
02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico is experiencing currently
 
02:16:29.689 --> 02:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
because of the infrastructure and the
 
02:16:30.830 --> 02:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
lack of
 
02:16:33.650 --> 02:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
and the exploitation from the corporate
 
02:16:35.929 --> 02:16:35.939 align:start position:0%
greed the pharmaceutical industry to be
 
02:16:38.810 --> 02:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
exact Puerto Rico has one of the highest
 
02:16:40.790 --> 02:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
asthma rates in the world and it's
 
02:16:42.770 --> 02:16:42.780 align:start position:0%
because of all the testing of pesticides
 
02:16:44.270 --> 02:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
in the pharmaceutical industry on the
 
02:16:45.709 --> 02:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
island and that's very well documented
 
02:16:48.469 --> 02:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
there's documentaries on Netflix uh
 
02:16:50.570 --> 02:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
National Geographics Etc so you can do
 
02:16:52.490 --> 02:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
that research but just to give you a
 
02:16:54.770 --> 02:16:54.780 align:start position:0%
little bit of feedback but right now
 
02:16:56.389 --> 02:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
Puerto Ricans are taking advantage
 
02:16:59.089 --> 02:16:59.099 align:start position:0%
anyways of our economic system I mean we
 
02:17:01.370 --> 02:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
pay for their Medicare that we paid for
 
02:17:04.190 --> 02:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
the their I mean there's a million
 
02:17:05.870 --> 02:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
benefits that the only benefit that
 
02:17:07.370 --> 02:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
Puerto Ricans right now don't take
 
02:17:09.770 --> 02:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
advantage of is social security
 
02:17:11.150 --> 02:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
um they're not entitled to that the
 
02:17:13.129 --> 02:17:13.139 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court does classify Puerto
 
02:17:14.450 --> 02:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
Ricans living in the island as
 
02:17:16.190 --> 02:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
second-class Citizens which is something
 
02:17:19.250 --> 02:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
I have a real hard time with so if I
 
02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
move I'm a first class citizen like you
 
02:17:23.389 --> 02:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
guys here in the United States if I move
 
02:17:24.950 --> 02:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
back to the island I'm a second class
 
02:17:26.629 --> 02:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
citizen according to the Supreme Court
 
02:17:29.450 --> 02:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
and that is the legal classification so
 
02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
you can call Puerto Rico what you want
 
02:17:32.209 --> 02:17:32.219 align:start position:0%
but it's a colony it's a territory
 
02:17:33.770 --> 02:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
there's nothing according to the Supreme
 
02:17:33.780 --> 02:17:34.730 align:start position:0%
there's nothing according to the Supreme
Court

02:17:34.730 --> 02:17:34.740 align:start position:0%
Court
 
02:17:37.070 --> 02:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question I do think
 
02:17:38.750 --> 02:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
that it'll be a fair Partnership if
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico became a state because then
 
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico would start paying taxes
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico currently does not pay taxes
 
02:17:46.969 --> 02:17:46.979 align:start position:0%
so it's actually not even beneficial
 
02:17:49.310 --> 02:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
economically for Puerto Rico to become a
 
02:17:51.530 --> 02:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
state because they would not only have
 
02:17:53.389 --> 02:17:53.399 align:start position:0%
to start paying taxes but essentially
 
02:17:55.790 --> 02:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
property tax too which currently Puerto
 
02:17:57.889 --> 02:17:57.899 align:start position:0%
Ricans don't pay
 
02:17:59.810 --> 02:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
as an indigenous person I do believe
 
02:18:02.089 --> 02:18:02.099 align:start position:0%
that property taxes are an infringement
 
02:18:04.730 --> 02:18:04.740 align:start position:0%
upon your right of your land but that's
 
02:18:06.230 --> 02:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
a whole different subject and I would
 
02:18:07.790 --> 02:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
love to partner with you guys anytime
 
02:18:09.530 --> 02:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
with that subject I pay way too much
 
02:18:09.540 --> 02:18:11.389 align:start position:0%
with that subject I pay way too much
taxes

02:18:11.389 --> 02:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
02:18:13.429 --> 02:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
um but in regards to Puerto Rico I hope
 
02:18:15.110 --> 02:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
that answers your question I do think
 
02:18:17.389 --> 02:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
for me personally and I'm trying to be
 
02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
fair with all Puerto Ricans because I
 
02:18:21.290 --> 02:18:21.300 align:start position:0%
feel like an enormous amount of
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility on my shoulders now being
 
02:18:25.429 --> 02:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
the only Puerto Rican in the room
 
02:18:28.370 --> 02:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
I think all of the statuses offer a fair
 
02:18:30.290 --> 02:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
chance I think what Puerto Ricans are
 
02:18:32.750 --> 02:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
only asking for is just give us a chance
 
02:18:35.270 --> 02:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
to have a democratic system which we
 
02:18:37.370 --> 02:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
currently don't have you can hold an
 
02:18:39.589 --> 02:18:39.599 align:start position:0%
election all you want but if it has
 
02:18:43.429 --> 02:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
non-legal ban binding responsibility
 
02:18:45.709 --> 02:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
then it's not a democratic system and I
 
02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
think we as Americans need to do a
 
02:18:48.589 --> 02:18:48.599 align:start position:0%
better job at advocating that even
 
02:18:50.750 --> 02:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
within our own borders
 
02:18:54.589 --> 02:18:54.599 align:start position:0%
other questions for Carlos
 
02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none yes uh representative Judy
 
02:19:02.810 --> 02:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman uh I would
 
02:19:06.049 --> 02:19:06.059 align:start position:0%
like you uh I would like to ask you if
 
02:19:08.810 --> 02:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
you still eat plantain
 
02:19:10.009 --> 02:19:10.019 align:start position:0%
I do
 
02:19:11.629 --> 02:19:11.639 align:start position:0%
um you know at Christmas time and I'm
 
02:19:13.070 --> 02:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
happy that you asked us because I would
 
02:19:16.190 --> 02:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
love it to be a New Hampshire record
 
02:19:18.110 --> 02:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
um there's a tradition that we have at
 
02:19:19.849 --> 02:19:19.859 align:start position:0%
Christmas time you may or may not know
 
02:19:22.009 --> 02:19:22.019 align:start position:0%
that tradition we eat pasteles which is
 
02:19:23.570 --> 02:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
made out of plantains it's a very
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
traditional African cuisine that was
 
02:19:29.049 --> 02:19:29.059 align:start position:0%
brought to us through slavery
 
02:19:31.969 --> 02:19:31.979 align:start position:0%
and you know even though I am obviously
 
02:19:34.370 --> 02:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
not in support of slavery I believe that
 
02:19:36.530 --> 02:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
those tradition and cultures and gifts
 
02:19:38.629 --> 02:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
that were brought over to Africa to us
 
02:19:40.849 --> 02:19:40.859 align:start position:0%
are very much part of our life and
 
02:19:42.110 --> 02:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
culture and it's something that is very
 
02:19:44.209 --> 02:19:44.219 align:start position:0%
still well alive while it is hard to
 
02:19:46.129 --> 02:19:46.139 align:start position:0%
find good plantains in the state of New
 
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I have seen the increase of
 
02:19:49.849 --> 02:19:49.859 align:start position:0%
good food in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
increasing and being imported here to
 
02:19:53.990 --> 02:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
the state and it shows another
 
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
contribution including the fact that
 
02:19:57.110 --> 02:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
Laconia you know when I first moved to
 
02:19:58.670 --> 02:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
Laconia there was no Spanish restaurant
 
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
we have four now today so to me that
 
02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
makes me happy that I can taste my own
 
02:20:06.410 --> 02:20:06.420 align:start position:0%
food right in my backyard thank you for
 
02:20:08.330 --> 02:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
asking that question yes Mr chair
 
02:20:11.469 --> 02:20:11.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:15.290 --> 02:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes do you like to see
 
02:20:18.889 --> 02:20:18.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:21.410 --> 02:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
you know like I said I my my thoughts
 
02:20:23.450 --> 02:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
are I'm in favor of anything that Puerto
 
02:20:24.950 --> 02:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
Rico decides and I hope that this
 
02:20:27.410 --> 02:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
resolution passes because the the it
 
02:20:28.910 --> 02:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
would send a strong message that New
 
02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire stands for democracy
 
02:20:34.490 --> 02:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
um but my personal belief is that Puerto
 
02:20:35.929 --> 02:20:35.939 align:start position:0%
Rico should be an independent nation
 
02:20:38.210 --> 02:20:38.220 align:start position:0%
with Alliance to the United States and
 
02:20:39.590 --> 02:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
for the several reasons that I made
 
02:20:41.570 --> 02:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
earlier the fact that I would love to
 
02:20:43.429 --> 02:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
visit continue to visit I would love a
 
02:20:45.170 --> 02:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
relationship like we have with Aruba
 
02:20:45.180 --> 02:20:46.309 align:start position:0%
relationship like we have with Aruba
Colombia

02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
Colombia
 
02:20:48.650 --> 02:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
where it's almost Visa free so we're
 
02:20:50.270 --> 02:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
able to travel back and forth and we
 
02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
have a great relationship with those
 
02:20:54.170 --> 02:20:54.180 align:start position:0%
Nations and of course we have military
 
02:20:56.270 --> 02:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
pact with those Nations and we have a
 
02:20:57.710 --> 02:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
great cooperation with them and I
 
02:20:59.210 --> 02:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
believe that Puerto Rico will be a huge
 
02:21:01.070 --> 02:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
asset to the United States especially
 
02:21:01.080 --> 02:21:02.150 align:start position:0%
asset to the United States especially
since

02:21:02.150 --> 02:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
since
 
02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
the location of the island in the
 
02:21:06.770 --> 02:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
Caribbean it's close enough
 
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
it's the closest territory of the United
 
02:21:10.790 --> 02:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
States to Africa it's the closest
 
02:21:12.889 --> 02:21:12.899 align:start position:0%
territory of the United States to South
 
02:21:14.990 --> 02:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
America it's very centrally located so I
 
02:21:18.050 --> 02:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
do believe that there is a mutual uh
 
02:21:19.849 --> 02:21:19.859 align:start position:0%
benefit but if Puerto Rico became a
 
02:21:19.859 --> 02:21:20.570 align:start position:0%
benefit but if Puerto Rico became a
state

02:21:20.570 --> 02:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:21:22.370 --> 02:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
I would not be disappointed and I'll be
 
02:21:24.410 --> 02:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
still Joseph's celebratory because I am
 
02:21:26.809 --> 02:21:26.819 align:start position:0%
part of this nation and I feel like I'm
 
02:21:28.610 --> 02:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
just as American as anybody else and I'm
 
02:21:30.590 --> 02:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
very proud and I'm proud of the service
 
02:21:32.510 --> 02:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
that my family has contributed to this
 
02:21:34.250 --> 02:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
nation and I want it to continue so if
 
02:21:36.530 --> 02:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
it became a state sure but my concerns
 
02:21:39.469 --> 02:21:39.479 align:start position:0%
why I would want Puerto Rico to become a
 
02:21:41.389 --> 02:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
nation of its own is for cultural
 
02:21:43.730 --> 02:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
reasons as an indigenous person
 
02:21:46.190 --> 02:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
I do believe that there are damages that
 
02:21:48.830 --> 02:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
we have done that are in repairable that
 
02:21:50.450 --> 02:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
if we became a state Unfortunately they
 
02:21:52.429 --> 02:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
might not be no return back especially
 
02:21:54.530 --> 02:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
when it comes to language
 
02:21:56.270 --> 02:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
um a lot of Puerto Ricans are relearning
 
02:21:57.889 --> 02:21:57.899 align:start position:0%
their indigenous language
 
02:21:59.389 --> 02:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
um it's being reconstructed and
 
02:22:01.309 --> 02:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
acknowledged by many nations and it's
 
02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
something that I would love to continue
 
02:22:05.170 --> 02:22:05.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:08.270 --> 02:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative G
 
02:22:11.870 --> 02:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
gracias representative Kerry
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to follow up you cited some
 
02:22:18.290 --> 02:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
statistics earlier and I wanted you to
 
02:22:21.650 --> 02:22:21.660 align:start position:0%
recite them and the source of those
 
02:22:25.190 --> 02:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
statistics the 25 statehood 25 Alliance
 
02:22:27.830 --> 02:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
that yeah I mean for sites my my
 
02:22:30.349 --> 02:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
references come very easily from the the
 
02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
last referendum that happened in the
 
02:22:34.250 --> 02:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
island there was a referendum I don't
 
02:22:35.870 --> 02:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
have the exact year on top of my head
 
02:22:39.050 --> 02:22:39.060 align:start position:0%
but I want to say it was 2013. but if
 
02:22:40.730 --> 02:22:40.740 align:start position:0%
you Google you know the last I know this
 
02:22:42.830 --> 02:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
is bad to say but if you Google the last
 
02:22:44.630 --> 02:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
referendum that happened in Puerto Rico
 
02:22:46.849 --> 02:22:46.859 align:start position:0%
in 2013 the majority of Puerto Ricans
 
02:22:48.650 --> 02:22:48.660 align:start position:0%
did vote for Statehood but you could see
 
02:22:50.750 --> 02:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
the percentages there
 
02:22:52.790 --> 02:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
um there's about 25 percent for pro
 
02:22:56.210 --> 02:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
stayhood 25 to some form of alliance
 
02:22:58.570 --> 02:22:58.580 align:start position:0%
with the United States was Sovereign 25
 
02:23:01.250 --> 02:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
you know we want independence and then
 
02:23:04.309 --> 02:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
there's another 25 percent that says
 
02:23:06.170 --> 02:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
um you know we just don't care we want
 
02:23:08.750 --> 02:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
to survive we want to live we don't care
 
02:23:09.950 --> 02:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
about politics and I think that's
 
02:23:11.210 --> 02:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
something we can relate to a little bit
 
02:23:13.309 --> 02:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire sure
 
02:23:14.950 --> 02:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:23:24.410 --> 02:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:27.770 --> 02:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
back in 65 I was in Puerto Rico I was in
 
02:23:28.730 --> 02:23:28.740 align:start position:0%
San Juan
 
02:23:30.770 --> 02:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
and we almost ran aground there in a
 
02:23:34.849 --> 02:23:34.859 align:start position:0%
channel because you know the the ship
 
02:23:38.210 --> 02:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
channel has been uh dynamited so the
 
02:23:40.309 --> 02:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
ship could go in well we instead of
 
02:23:40.319 --> 02:23:41.510 align:start position:0%
ship could go in well we instead of
going

02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
going
 
02:23:44.809 --> 02:23:44.819 align:start position:0%
to the left of the red buoy which is red
 
02:23:46.730 --> 02:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
right returning
 
02:23:49.309 --> 02:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
he went to the right and we ended up
 
02:23:51.770 --> 02:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
with doing about five feet
 
02:23:55.309 --> 02:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
of water between the ship and
 
02:23:58.389 --> 02:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
Abandoned Ship stuff anyway my question
 
02:24:01.190 --> 02:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
my question is uh
 
02:24:04.490 --> 02:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
did the Bacardi Factory in Iran Rico
 
02:24:07.429 --> 02:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
Factory survive Maria
 
02:24:09.770 --> 02:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
well you know I'm glad you care about
 
02:24:12.950 --> 02:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
the alcohol industry in the island it's
 
02:24:14.570 --> 02:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
something I definitely care about around
 
02:24:17.389 --> 02:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
the holidays the Bacardi Factor did
 
02:24:19.190 --> 02:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
survive I do want to add some a little
 
02:24:21.110 --> 02:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
fun fact most of you guys know Bacardi
 
02:24:23.090 --> 02:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
is a Puerto Rican rum but it actually it
 
02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
originated in Cuba after the Communist
 
02:24:29.090 --> 02:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
uprise the owners of Bacardi were giving
 
02:24:31.250 --> 02:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
an ultimatum you either move or we own
 
02:24:34.010 --> 02:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
you and so they said well Puerto Rico
 
02:24:37.270 --> 02:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
has a similar flag similar language uh
 
02:24:41.150 --> 02:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
dialect similar food similar music it's
 
02:24:42.830 --> 02:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
beautiful why not so they moved to the
 
02:24:44.090 --> 02:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
island so
 
02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
um so that's the quick history of
 
02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:47.870 align:start position:0%
um so that's the quick history of
Bacardi

02:24:47.870 --> 02:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
Bacardi
 
02:24:51.050 --> 02:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:24:51.060 --> 02:24:53.570 align:start position:0%
other questions
uh

02:24:53.570 --> 02:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:24:53.580 --> 02:24:55.190 align:start position:0%
uh
oftentimes

02:24:55.190 --> 02:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
oftentimes
 
02:24:58.429 --> 02:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:00.830 --> 02:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
nature what I really like about this
 
02:25:03.950 --> 02:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
resolution is that it doesn't seem of a
 
02:25:05.570 --> 02:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
partisan nature it seems like we could
 
02:25:06.790 --> 02:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
all come together around
 
02:25:10.550 --> 02:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
self-determination can you speak to if
 
02:25:14.030 --> 02:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
you believe that the nature of this
 
02:25:17.270 --> 02:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
resolution is bipartisan and why both
 
02:25:19.250 --> 02:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
Democrats and Republicans can come
 
02:25:20.990 --> 02:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
together to support this
 
02:25:22.730 --> 02:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
thank you so much that you brought that
 
02:25:24.110 --> 02:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
because that was not even on my mind and
 
02:25:26.030 --> 02:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
I should because I oftentimes see New
 
02:25:27.469 --> 02:25:27.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as where Granite Staters will
 
02:25:28.969 --> 02:25:28.979 align:start position:0%
get along
 
02:25:30.710 --> 02:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
um but that's not always the case we
 
02:25:32.570 --> 02:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
obviously have a political affiliation I
 
02:25:33.889 --> 02:25:33.899 align:start position:0%
will tell you that a similar resolution
 
02:25:35.870 --> 02:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
the Puerto Rico Act was passed before
 
02:25:39.290 --> 02:25:39.300 align:start position:0%
Congress and it did have support I did
 
02:25:41.389 --> 02:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
want to add for my Republican friends on
 
02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
this committee that the statehood
 
02:25:45.650 --> 02:25:45.660 align:start position:0%
pro-statehood movement is supported by
 
02:25:47.450 --> 02:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
actually the co-chair in Puerto Rico of
 
02:25:48.650 --> 02:25:48.660 align:start position:0%
Donald Trump
 
02:25:50.870 --> 02:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
so the pro-statehood movement is by
 
02:25:52.370 --> 02:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
Jennifer Gonzalez who's the current
 
02:25:54.590 --> 02:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner representative for this for
 
02:25:58.070 --> 02:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico in DC she has been a strong
 
02:26:00.530 --> 02:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
advocate of statehood and she actually
 
02:26:02.210 --> 02:26:02.220 align:start position:0%
Donald Trump has sinned many times that
 
02:26:03.830 --> 02:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
he would support it so to my Republican
 
02:26:06.230 --> 02:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
friends here this is actually a
 
02:26:08.330 --> 02:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
resolution that very similarly passed
 
02:26:10.250 --> 02:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
before DC the differences the DC
 
02:26:13.309 --> 02:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
resolution was actually legally binding
 
02:26:15.530 --> 02:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
telling Puerto Rico they can have their
 
02:26:18.170 --> 02:26:18.180 align:start position:0%
own referendum allowing them to have a
 
02:26:20.389 --> 02:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
legally binding referendum so to my
 
02:26:22.070 --> 02:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
Republican friends this is a resolution
 
02:26:25.849 --> 02:26:25.859 align:start position:0%
the Republicans on the island love I
 
02:26:27.889 --> 02:26:27.899 align:start position:0%
will say for the record because this I
 
02:26:30.410 --> 02:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
think puts us in a friendly territory I
 
02:26:32.270 --> 02:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
am a registered Democrat and I'm a very
 
02:26:33.830 --> 02:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
strong Democrat so to my Democrat
 
02:26:36.349 --> 02:26:36.359 align:start position:0%
friends I'm asking you to please support
 
02:26:38.030 --> 02:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
this for the simple reason that is the
 
02:26:39.950 --> 02:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
right thing for us to come together this
 
02:26:42.410 --> 02:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
is non-partisan this is a situation that
 
02:26:44.330 --> 02:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
both Republicans and Democrats in the
 
02:26:47.150 --> 02:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
island want to get done and over with
 
02:26:49.849 --> 02:26:49.859 align:start position:0%
um but yeah it is supported heavily by
 
02:26:51.950 --> 02:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
Republicans and and I encourage you all
 
02:26:54.590 --> 02:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
to see Jennifer Gonzalez speech I you
 
02:26:56.450 --> 02:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
know I'm not the biggest fan of
 
02:26:58.250 --> 02:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
Representative uh or commissioner
 
02:26:59.870 --> 02:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
representative non-voting member of
 
02:27:02.690 --> 02:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
Congress Jennifer Gonzalez um for
 
02:27:04.309 --> 02:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
several reasons economic reasons uh
 
02:27:06.530 --> 02:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
policies that she holds but like the
 
02:27:08.210 --> 02:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
Jones act which I think it's a terrible
 
02:27:10.790 --> 02:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
law that was enacted in 1917 to the
 
02:27:11.990 --> 02:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
territories I think it's more
 
02:27:14.150 --> 02:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
infringement on state rights
 
02:27:17.090 --> 02:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
but that said we do agree and I have
 
02:27:19.730 --> 02:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
spoken many times in DC in regards most
 
02:27:21.650 --> 02:27:21.660 align:start position:0%
recently back in December I was in DC
 
02:27:23.990 --> 02:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
speaking into this bill how we need to
 
02:27:26.510 --> 02:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
Democrats I my my voice was there to
 
02:27:28.490 --> 02:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
encourage Democrats to join Republicans
 
02:27:31.010 --> 02:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
in this resolution so I think in this
 
02:27:32.510 --> 02:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
state this is a beautiful opportunity
 
02:27:34.790 --> 02:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
for all of you guys to come together
 
02:27:36.830 --> 02:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
and support a resolution that one
 
02:27:39.050 --> 02:27:39.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't cost us anything I know that we
 
02:27:41.630 --> 02:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
love that and two the fact that it is
 
02:27:44.570 --> 02:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
non-partisan I mean it supports every
 
02:27:46.130 --> 02:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
voice in the island of Puerto Rico and
 
02:27:48.830 --> 02:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
just so you are also aware quickly uh
 
02:27:50.270 --> 02:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
the island of Puerto Rico the governor
 
02:27:51.710 --> 02:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
is a Republican
 
02:27:53.570 --> 02:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
uh the majority of the Senate and the
 
02:27:55.849 --> 02:27:55.859 align:start position:0%
house are Republicans and this is a
 
02:27:57.770 --> 02:27:57.780 align:start position:0%
resolution that they've been advocating
 
02:28:01.429 --> 02:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
for for the past at least 10 years so
 
02:28:03.170 --> 02:28:03.180 align:start position:0%
this is nothing new and the research is
 
02:28:05.090 --> 02:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
out there you're welcome to Google it
 
02:28:07.730 --> 02:28:07.740 align:start position:0%
but this is something that is very very
 
02:28:11.210 --> 02:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
supportive by Republicans in the island
 
02:28:13.010 --> 02:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
um even if I may not agree on some
 
02:28:14.389 --> 02:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
policies with them
 
02:28:16.490 --> 02:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:28:18.530 --> 02:28:18.540 align:start position:0%

this community to support HR 13. I would

love for Puerto Rico to be part of the

Puerto Rico as our nation's 51st state
 
02:29:27.349 --> 02:29:27.359 align:start position:0%

if they decide to join the union that
 
02:29:37.790 --> 02:29:37.800 align:start position:0%

03:38:07.790 --> 03:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
faces the possibility of being shut down

nearly every year because

yeah go ahead and finish sure I made it
 
03:38:55.250 --> 03:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
this Mark
 
03:38:57.229 --> 03:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
whereas the United Nations human rights
 
03:38:58.969 --> 03:38:58.979 align:start position:0%

03:39:01.610 --> 03:39:01.620 align:start position:0%
Congress to address the D.C lack of

03:39:19.969 --> 03:39:19.979 align:start position:0%
we asked the House of Representatives of
 
03:39:23.990 --> 03:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire support admitting them

families involved
 
03:39:37.130 --> 03:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
in government certainly in serving the
 
03:39:39.590 --> 03:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
military has had a big impact on me and
 
03:39:42.229 --> 03:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
my earliest memories of travel was to DC
 
03:39:45.469 --> 03:39:45.479 align:start position:0%
my great aunt worked for NASA as a
 
03:39:48.170 --> 03:39:48.180 align:start position:0%

03:39:51.590 --> 03:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
House
 
03:39:58.130 --> 03:39:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:59.269 --> 03:39:59.279 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
03:40:02.290 --> 03:40:02.300 align:start position:0%
Washington DC being the center of
 
03:40:05.570 --> 03:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
democracy of the world it is a Cathedral
 
03:40:08.030 --> 03:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
of democracy
 
03:40:11.929 --> 03:40:11.939 align:start position:0%
and no better place than Washington DC
 
03:40:14.990 --> 03:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
to have his whole representation
 
03:40:17.750 --> 03:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
and are there any questions
 
03:40:19.309 --> 03:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me take questions
 
03:40:25.130 --> 03:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:28.429 --> 03:40:28.439 align:start position:0%
to see I have a quick uh common question
 
03:40:30.889 --> 03:40:30.899 align:start position:0%
uh representative my boss has been a
 
03:40:33.229 --> 03:40:33.239 align:start position:0%
great deal of time in great DC
 
03:40:36.530 --> 03:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
uh my question I guess is should state
 
03:40:38.570 --> 03:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
house or should a standard come around
 
03:40:41.570 --> 03:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
with the traffic problems be any better
 
03:40:46.729 --> 03:40:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:48.410 --> 03:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
you think that that
 
03:40:50.690 --> 03:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
things would have the competitive
 
03:40:55.550 --> 03:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:58.490 --> 03:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
I wish anyone who distributed emergency
 
03:41:00.650 --> 03:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
notice it takes
 
03:41:02.870 --> 03:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
versus driving matters
 
03:41:05.690 --> 03:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
and today then ask the world's driving
 
03:41:07.670 --> 03:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
jobs too
 
03:41:07.680 --> 03:41:08.990 align:start position:0%
jobs too
um Irish

03:41:08.990 --> 03:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
um Irish
 
03:41:10.130 --> 03:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
that's why they have a great public
 
03:41:15.229 --> 03:41:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:15.239 --> 03:41:45.670 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:41:45.670 --> 03:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:45.680 --> 03:41:47.210 align:start position:0%
 
together

03:41:47.210 --> 03:41:47.220 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:41:50.630 --> 03:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
it would be that it's the only land
 
03:41:54.650 --> 03:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
where U.S citizens live that does not
 
03:42:00.910 --> 03:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:02.929 --> 03:42:02.939 align:start position:0%
's capital
 
03:42:05.410 --> 03:42:05.420 align:start position:0%
yet doesn't have true representation
 
03:42:08.269 --> 03:42:08.279 align:start position:0%
like every other
 
03:42:11.510 --> 03:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
aspect of the United States is just
 
03:42:14.030 --> 03:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
impossible to me and it doesn't even
 
03:42:17.570 --> 03:42:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:17.580 --> 03:42:20.150 align:start position:0%

03:43:02.330 --> 03:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:03.889 --> 03:43:03.899 align:start position:0%
covered uh
 
03:43:03.899 --> 03:43:04.990 align:start position:0%
covered uh

03:43:04.990 --> 03:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:43:07.849 --> 03:43:07.859 align:start position:0%
kind of the most amazing
 
03:43:10.370 --> 03:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
not to repeat too much of the electro
 
03:43:10.380 --> 03:43:12.050 align:start position:0%
not to repeat too much of the electro

03:43:12.050 --> 03:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
iron
 
03:43:13.309 --> 03:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
IC since
 
03:43:16.250 --> 03:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
in the District of Columbia such bigger
 
03:43:18.889 --> 03:43:18.899 align:start position:0%
than two of the uh took the existing
 
03:43:20.570 --> 03:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
mistakes which is so that's good in
 
03:43:23.269 --> 03:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
Vermont and they deserved
 
03:43:26.510 --> 03:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
full representation in Congress although
 
03:43:29.210 --> 03:43:29.220 align:start position:0%
although I am handed watch CBS featuring
 
03:43:30.950 --> 03:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
Congress selection so sometimes that's a
 
03:43:33.769 --> 03:43:33.779 align:start position:0%
duty is honored but if
 
03:43:33.779 --> 03:43:34.849 align:start position:0%
duty is honored but if
big

03:43:34.849 --> 03:43:34.859 align:start position:0%
big
 
03:43:34.859 --> 03:43:35.929 align:start position:0%
big
dick facility

03:43:35.929 --> 03:43:35.939 align:start position:0%
dick facility
 
03:43:38.510 --> 03:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
it's important that the program Jose
 
03:43:40.610 --> 03:43:40.620 align:start position:0%
have no senators and they certainly
 
03:43:40.620 --> 03:43:41.630 align:start position:0%
have no senators and they certainly
deserve

03:43:41.630 --> 03:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
deserve
 
03:43:43.790 --> 03:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
to deserve to pick if those they were
 
03:43:46.309 --> 03:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
safe they were entitled to uh to
 
03:43:49.670 --> 03:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
a state that the population and and two
 
03:43:49.680 --> 03:43:51.050 align:start position:0%
a state that the population and and two
senators

03:43:51.050 --> 03:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
senators
 
03:43:53.690 --> 03:43:53.700 align:start position:0%
and uh they do they do have a delegate
 
03:43:57.050 --> 03:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
one of the house rules um has full most
 
03:43:58.750 --> 03:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
of the Privileges of a rep they already
 
03:44:01.429 --> 03:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
so their current delegates who've been
 
03:44:03.349 --> 03:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
1990s one of the most respective members
 
03:44:06.110 --> 03:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
of the U.S house is Eleanor Holmes
 
03:44:09.170 --> 03:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
Norton and she's uh this has even been a
 
03:44:11.210 --> 03:44:11.220 align:start position:0%
committee chair in the past but she's a
 
03:44:13.550 --> 03:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
very well respected member and she can
 
03:44:14.870 --> 03:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
participate fully in the committee
 
03:44:16.729 --> 03:44:16.739 align:start position:0%
process but she can't vote on the floor
 
03:44:18.650 --> 03:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
not on legislation not even in the
 
03:44:21.050 --> 03:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
leadership election which is your called
 
03:44:23.929 --> 03:44:23.939 align:start position:0%
hints not a very few votes
 
03:44:25.429 --> 03:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:44:27.590 --> 03:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
the there's going to be uh I know
 
03:44:30.229 --> 03:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
there's some criticisms I mean there's
 
03:44:32.510 --> 03:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
like one Congressman last time he's
 
03:44:34.370 --> 03:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
considered Congress claimed they could
 
03:44:35.570 --> 03:44:35.580 align:start position:0%
be a state because they don't have an
 
03:44:37.250 --> 03:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
auto dealership I don't know if that's
 
03:44:38.990 --> 03:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
true or not but I mean that's not a
 
03:44:42.349 --> 03:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
requirement but uh it would be obviously
 
03:44:44.929 --> 03:44:44.939 align:start position:0%
the smallest state by far in size since
 
03:44:48.590 --> 03:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
it's just a a medium-sized City but
 
03:44:50.510 --> 03:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
um it uh I think there's a lot of value
 
03:44:52.910 --> 03:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
to give you the full representation dark
 
03:44:55.790 --> 03:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
a couple there are a couple of
 
03:44:57.769 --> 03:44:57.779 align:start position:0%
and there are some practical issues in
 
03:44:59.990 --> 03:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
the past like for example uh not to go
 
03:45:01.790 --> 03:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
in too much details but not long ago
 
03:45:03.410 --> 03:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
03:45:06.650 --> 03:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
serious incident at at the U.S Capitol
 
03:45:09.530 --> 03:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
and the mayor
 
03:45:12.349 --> 03:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
was a hampered in her inner efforts to
 
03:45:13.790 --> 03:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
respond just because the limitations
 
03:45:16.250 --> 03:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
since she's not a governor she's just a
 
03:45:18.469 --> 03:45:18.479 align:start position:0%
mayor and um
 
03:45:21.290 --> 03:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
I guess there's some and so as a result
 
03:45:23.210 --> 03:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
for example the DC National Guard they
 
03:45:26.030 --> 03:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
do have a National Guard was not of
 
03:45:29.090 --> 03:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
was not able it was not able to step in
 
03:45:31.010 --> 03:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
as fast as they would have been if this
 
03:45:32.330 --> 03:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
had to say happened
 
03:45:34.550 --> 03:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
she was not able as debates in another
 
03:45:36.410 --> 03:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
state so I'm sure like governor sanduno
 
03:45:37.729 --> 03:45:37.739 align:start position:0%
for example if there's an incident here
 
03:45:39.650 --> 03:45:39.660 align:start position:0%
could call it the National Guard uh you
 
03:45:41.450 --> 03:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
know instantaneously without anybody
 
03:45:43.729 --> 03:45:43.739 align:start position:0%
else's permission but
 
03:45:45.410 --> 03:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of practical issues
 
03:45:48.290 --> 03:45:48.300 align:start position:0%
like that there's going to be and also
 
03:45:51.110 --> 03:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
even after if it becomes a state
 
03:45:51.120 --> 03:45:51.710 align:start position:0%
even after if it becomes a state
um

03:45:51.710 --> 03:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:53.870 --> 03:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
to be an enabling an act and that could
 
03:45:55.490 --> 03:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
express some of the issues have been
 
03:45:57.830 --> 03:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
used to argue against uh statehood I
 
03:45:59.929 --> 03:45:59.939 align:start position:0%
mean like for example uh
 
03:46:02.750 --> 03:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
they owned a D.C National airport which
 
03:46:04.429 --> 03:46:04.439 align:start position:0%
is technically in Virginia they're
 
03:46:04.439 --> 03:46:05.750 align:start position:0%
is technically in Virginia they're
prisoners

03:46:05.750 --> 03:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
prisoners
 
03:46:08.809 --> 03:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
are imprisoned uh in federal prisons
 
03:46:10.190 --> 03:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
across the country because they don't
 
03:46:12.710 --> 03:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
have a Penitentiary of their own they
 
03:46:13.969 --> 03:46:13.979 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure where their water supply
 
03:46:15.650 --> 03:46:15.660 align:start position:0%
comes from but it's probably outside the
 
03:46:17.330 --> 03:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
district but those things
 
03:46:20.630 --> 03:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
can be addressed in an enabling Act
 
03:46:24.590 --> 03:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
and also if the committee an alternative
 
03:46:27.170 --> 03:46:27.180 align:start position:0%
of course and I guess if and also like
 
03:46:30.290 --> 03:46:30.300 align:start position:0%
uh as just repeat what said before but
 
03:46:32.450 --> 03:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
relate to that is that we're the
 
03:46:34.670 --> 03:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
only Democratic country probably the
 
03:46:35.710 --> 03:46:35.720 align:start position:0%
only country
 
03:46:38.150 --> 03:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
non-democratic or Democratic where the
 
03:46:42.050 --> 03:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
uh where the capital many cities have a
 
03:46:43.910 --> 03:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
federal district like we do that's not
 
03:46:45.530 --> 03:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
part of a state or a province whatever
 
03:46:46.910 --> 03:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
they have but this we're the only one
 
03:46:48.950 --> 03:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
where they don't have full uh
 
03:46:51.530 --> 03:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
representation in the in the Congress or
 
03:46:54.830 --> 03:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
other National institutions so that uh
 
03:46:56.929 --> 03:46:56.939 align:start position:0%
and uh so that's
 
03:47:00.769 --> 03:47:00.779 align:start position:0%
it's just Justice is long overdue and
 
03:47:03.889 --> 03:47:03.899 align:start position:0%
should be fixed and also point out uh
 
03:47:05.570 --> 03:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
some countries
 
03:47:07.490 --> 03:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
lots of countries give their Federal
 
03:47:09.110 --> 03:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
have a federal district that's a
 
03:47:10.729 --> 03:47:10.739 align:start position:0%
different slightly different legal
 
03:47:14.150 --> 03:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
status from the other subdivisions but
 
03:47:14.160 --> 03:47:14.809 align:start position:0%
status from the other subdivisions but
um

03:47:14.809 --> 03:47:14.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:17.570 --> 03:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
every other country as I said they give
 
03:47:18.950 --> 03:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
the residents of the federal district
 
03:47:21.290 --> 03:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
the same political rights as people of
 
03:47:22.610 --> 03:47:22.620 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country you know like
 
03:47:23.809 --> 03:47:23.819 align:start position:0%
for example
 
03:47:27.110 --> 03:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
for example Mexico
 
03:47:28.670 --> 03:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
they have a separate federal district
 
03:47:31.070 --> 03:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
for the city of Mexico but every every
 
03:47:34.130 --> 03:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
uh it's the Constitution guarantees of
 
03:47:35.630 --> 03:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
all the rights of a state and that's
 
03:47:38.389 --> 03:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
true with other countries so please
 
03:47:40.610 --> 03:47:40.620 align:start position:0%
please vote for this resolution and I
 
03:47:42.889 --> 03:47:42.899 align:start position:0%
said taxation without representation is
 
03:47:46.309 --> 03:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:48.849 --> 03:47:48.859 align:start position:0%
would you take any questions
 
03:47:52.250 --> 03:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
uh well sure
 
03:47:58.250 --> 03:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:02.090 --> 03:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
seeing none they will let you go thank
 
03:48:04.550 --> 03:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
you our Senator Morgan
 
03:48:06.290 --> 03:48:06.300 align:start position:0%
would anyone else like to speak to this
 
03:48:06.300 --> 03:48:11.630 align:start position:0%
would anyone else like to speak to this
measure

03:48:11.630 --> 03:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:11.640 --> 03:48:13.010 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:48:13.010 --> 03:48:13.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:48:17.870 --> 03:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:20.809 --> 03:48:20.819 align:start position:0%
my name is representative Schmidt again
 
03:48:23.150 --> 03:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
I didn't find a pink card in the back so
 
03:48:27.290 --> 03:48:27.300 align:start position:0%
I will sign in subsequently so
 
03:48:30.229 --> 03:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
look around you
 
03:48:33.769 --> 03:48:33.779 align:start position:0%
this committee has either cooperatively
 
03:48:38.150 --> 03:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
or or uh in the person of the chair
 
03:48:42.610 --> 03:48:42.620 align:start position:0%
deemed this in an issue of significance
 
03:48:45.830 --> 03:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
sufficient significance to have you all
 
03:48:48.110 --> 03:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
come here in Representatives Hall
 
03:48:50.210 --> 03:48:50.220 align:start position:0%
because of the possibility that the
 
03:48:52.150 --> 03:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire
 
03:48:55.190 --> 03:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
would want to weigh in on this and the
 
03:48:58.130 --> 03:48:58.140 align:start position:0%
committee room would be too small
 
03:49:01.070 --> 03:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
you understand the significance of this
 
03:49:04.130 --> 03:49:04.140 align:start position:0%
issue unfortunately
 
03:49:07.610 --> 03:49:07.620 align:start position:0%
um and in terms of the citizenry either
 
03:49:09.910 --> 03:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
for a lack of notification or awareness
 
03:49:14.450 --> 03:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
uh is not here uh to take up your
 
03:49:16.570 --> 03:49:16.580 align:start position:0%
perceived uh
 
03:49:19.309 --> 03:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
importance of this issue but that
 
03:49:21.769 --> 03:49:21.779 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that it is less important
 
03:49:25.550 --> 03:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:28.849 --> 03:49:28.859 align:start position:0%
the bill the resolution has been read to
 
03:49:28.859 --> 03:49:29.889 align:start position:0%
the bill the resolution has been read to
you

03:49:29.889 --> 03:49:29.899 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:49:32.750 --> 03:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
and so I won't believe be there for any
 
03:49:34.370 --> 03:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
of the issues that you've already heard
 
03:49:37.910 --> 03:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
and the facts but the reality is this
 
03:49:40.790 --> 03:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
that DC ought to be a state
 
03:49:44.269 --> 03:49:44.279 align:start position:0%
its citizens should not be denied the
 
03:49:46.969 --> 03:49:46.979 align:start position:0%
new representation so I hope that you
 
03:49:50.150 --> 03:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
will support the motion when of ought to
 
03:49:52.250 --> 03:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
pass when it comes up thank you very
 
03:49:52.260 --> 03:49:53.210 align:start position:0%
pass when it comes up thank you very
much

03:49:53.210 --> 03:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
much
 
03:49:55.729 --> 03:49:55.739 align:start position:0%
I'll answer any questions you might have
 
03:50:01.250 --> 03:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:02.870 --> 03:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
and saying that I thank you for your
 
03:50:04.790 --> 03:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you
 
03:50:07.670 --> 03:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
in a pink card of course and I see
 
03:50:12.530 --> 03:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:14.990 --> 03:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
going to be recognized from the other
 
03:50:18.050 --> 03:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
side of Representative C welcome to the
 
03:50:18.060 --> 03:50:20.809 align:start position:0%
side of Representative C welcome to the
hearing

03:50:20.809 --> 03:50:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:22.429 --> 03:50:22.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and members of the committee
 
03:50:24.710 --> 03:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
my name is Alvin C I represent Merrimack
 
03:50:26.950 --> 03:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
County District 26.
 
03:50:30.290 --> 03:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
I'm not taking a position on this
 
03:50:32.690 --> 03:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
particular bill but I did want to
 
03:50:36.769 --> 03:50:36.779 align:start position:0%
suggest that I think it's in the Puerto
 
03:50:41.269 --> 03:50:41.279 align:start position:0%
Rico now jeez I'm sorry wrong bill in
 
03:50:43.389 --> 03:50:43.399 align:start position:0%
the country's
 
03:50:45.950 --> 03:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
best interest not to create another
 
03:50:45.960 --> 03:50:47.269 align:start position:0%
best interest not to create another
state

03:50:47.269 --> 03:50:47.279 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:50:49.670 --> 03:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
03:50:53.090 --> 03:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
if the district doesn't need all the
 
03:50:55.610 --> 03:50:55.620 align:start position:0%
land they have it should be returned to
 
03:50:57.670 --> 03:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
the state of Maryland
 
03:51:00.349 --> 03:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
when the district was originally formed
 
03:51:03.170 --> 03:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
it was 10 miles by 10 miles with
 
03:51:04.969 --> 03:51:04.979 align:start position:0%
approximately half in Virginia and half
 
03:51:07.190 --> 03:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
in Maryland when they realized they
 
03:51:10.010 --> 03:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
didn't need the party in Virginia it was
 
03:51:11.750 --> 03:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
returned to the state of Virginia so
 
03:51:13.849 --> 03:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
there is precedence for that
 
03:51:17.510 --> 03:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
and I think the best thing would be just
 
03:51:21.410 --> 03:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
simply to return the land to state of
 
03:51:23.210 --> 03:51:23.220 align:start position:0%
Maryland if the district doesn't need it
 
03:51:24.349 --> 03:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:51:26.750 --> 03:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
I'll take questions if there are any
 
03:51:29.809 --> 03:51:29.819 align:start position:0%
girls have so my question to you on that
 
03:51:33.349 --> 03:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
would be word this to revert the
 
03:51:35.030 --> 03:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
original District of Columbia as you
 
03:51:36.590 --> 03:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
pointed out included a lot of land in
 
03:51:38.809 --> 03:51:38.819 align:start position:0%
Virginia Which uh went back to Virginia
 
03:51:41.330 --> 03:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
what belonged to Maryland is now what is
 
03:51:43.790 --> 03:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
the District of Columbia so if that
 
03:51:45.650 --> 03:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
reverted to Maryland then Maryland would
 
03:51:47.570 --> 03:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
pick up like one
 
03:51:50.389 --> 03:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
or two Congress people correct
 
03:51:53.090 --> 03:51:53.100 align:start position:0%
well that would be entirely possible
 
03:51:56.630 --> 03:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
okay uh it it depends on what the
 
03:51:58.550 --> 03:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
population is versus all the other
 
03:52:01.610 --> 03:52:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:04.910 --> 03:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
but yes it's likely that Maryland would
 
03:52:04.920 --> 03:52:06.010 align:start position:0%
but yes it's likely that Maryland would
increase

03:52:06.010 --> 03:52:06.020 align:start position:0%
increase
 
03:52:08.690 --> 03:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
their delegation
 
03:52:10.790 --> 03:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
to the Congress
 
03:52:14.389 --> 03:52:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:16.670 --> 03:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
seen on thank you representative C thank
 
03:52:19.070 --> 03:52:19.080 align:start position:0%

03:52:26.389 --> 03:52:26.399 align:start position:0%
and if not uh at this time we'll con uh
 
03:52:29.690 --> 03:52:29.700 align:start position:0%
we'll conclude this uh hearing

I Rise to present house concurrent
 
04:02:13.370 --> 04:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
resolution one Convention of states
 
04:02:16.429 --> 04:02:16.439 align:start position:0%
Article 5 establishes two paths to
 
04:02:19.910 --> 04:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
create a constitutional amendment
 
04:02:23.090 --> 04:02:23.100 align:start position:0%
not a constitutional convention but a
 
04:02:25.729 --> 04:02:25.739 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment
 
04:02:29.389 --> 04:02:29.399 align:start position:0%
those two paths are either Congress
 
04:02:32.570 --> 04:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
or a Convention of two-thirds of the
 
04:02:32.580 --> 04:02:33.530 align:start position:0%
or a Convention of two-thirds of the
states

04:02:33.530 --> 04:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:02:36.349 --> 04:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
May propose an amendment
 
04:02:39.110 --> 04:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
then three-quarters of the states in
 
04:02:42.290 --> 04:02:42.300 align:start position:0%
either route are required to ratify that
 
04:02:45.349 --> 04:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment before it becomes an amendment
 
04:02:47.689 --> 04:02:47.699 align:start position:0%
not a chance not to redo the
 
04:02:49.910 --> 04:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution but an amendment to the
 
04:02:49.920 --> 04:02:52.070 align:start position:0%
Constitution but an amendment to the
Constitution

04:02:52.070 --> 04:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
04:02:55.550 --> 04:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
neither of these processes would be
 
04:02:58.550 --> 04:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
successful if the great will of the
 
04:03:01.429 --> 04:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
American people was not behind it
 
04:03:04.870 --> 04:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
polls have shown an overwhelming
 
04:03:08.150 --> 04:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support for the convention of
 
04:03:10.130 --> 04:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
State subject matter
 
04:03:12.889 --> 04:03:12.899 align:start position:0%
this resolution seeks a convention to
 
04:03:16.070 --> 04:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
impose fiscal restraints on the on the
 
04:03:18.889 --> 04:03:18.899 align:start position:0%
federal government commonly referred to
 
04:03:21.769 --> 04:03:21.779 align:start position:0%
as a balanced budget amendment
 
04:03:24.349 --> 04:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
limit powers and jurisdictions of the
 
04:03:25.729 --> 04:03:25.739 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
04:03:28.070 --> 04:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
and impose term limits on federal
 
04:03:28.080 --> 04:03:30.050 align:start position:0%
and impose term limits on federal
officials

04:03:30.050 --> 04:03:30.060 align:start position:0%
officials
 
04:03:33.170 --> 04:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
the common tasking has been adopted by
 
04:03:36.530 --> 04:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
19 other states today
 
04:03:38.750 --> 04:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
again there's overwhelming public
 
04:03:38.760 --> 04:03:40.070 align:start position:0%
again there's overwhelming public
support

04:03:40.070 --> 04:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:03:42.170 --> 04:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
to address these issues
 
04:03:45.410 --> 04:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
55 percent of Democrats 65 percent of
 
04:03:47.870 --> 04:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
independent 75 percent of Republicans
 
04:03:50.870 --> 04:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
when polled agree that these resolutions
 
04:03:53.269 --> 04:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
need to be taken up
 
04:03:57.410 --> 04:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
yet Congress does not act
 
04:03:59.630 --> 04:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
why is that
 
04:04:02.269 --> 04:04:02.279 align:start position:0%
it's not in their interest to limit
 
04:04:05.929 --> 04:04:05.939 align:start position:0%
their financial or personal power or
 
04:04:08.510 --> 04:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
time in office
 
04:04:10.490 --> 04:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
this point received considerable
 
04:04:12.070 --> 04:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
discussion during the Philadelphia
 
04:04:15.530 --> 04:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
Convention forming our nation
 
04:04:18.410 --> 04:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
the need for State Convention was
 
04:04:20.870 --> 04:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
proposed initially by Charles Pinckney
 
04:04:22.910 --> 04:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
at the very start of the Constitutional
 
04:04:25.550 --> 04:04:25.560 align:start position:0%

concurs
 
04:04:38.150 --> 04:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
they say we're wearing short Congress
 
04:04:41.269 --> 04:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
would not always be trusted to do what
 
04:04:42.950 --> 04:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
is in the best interest of the country
 
04:04:45.469 --> 04:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
and that when it is
 
04:04:47.570 --> 04:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
when it is the practice of Congress
 
04:04:50.269 --> 04:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
itself that gave rise to the need for
 
04:04:53.090 --> 04:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
amendments some other body should be
 
04:04:56.349 --> 04:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
made available to the people to initiate
 
04:05:01.130 --> 04:05:01.140 align:start position:0%
changes to the Constitution
 
04:05:04.070 --> 04:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
Federalist 51 addresses the need for
 
04:05:07.670 --> 04:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
checks and balances separation of powers
 
04:05:11.330 --> 04:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
but there also Madison writes if men
 
04:05:13.849 --> 04:05:13.859 align:start position:0%
were Angels no government would be
 
04:05:13.859 --> 04:05:15.349 align:start position:0%
were Angels no government would be
necessary

04:05:15.349 --> 04:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
04:05:17.689 --> 04:05:17.699 align:start position:0%
he further notes
 
04:05:20.150 --> 04:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
should the provision of the Constitution
 
04:05:24.410 --> 04:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
as here reviewed by to be found not to
 
04:05:26.630 --> 04:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
secure the government and the rights of
 
04:05:29.030 --> 04:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
the states against user patients and
 
04:05:32.570 --> 04:05:32.580 align:start position:0%
abuses on the part of the United States
 
04:05:35.330 --> 04:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
the final Resort within the Constitution
 
04:05:38.110 --> 04:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
lies in an Amendment of the Constitution
 
04:05:42.410 --> 04:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
according to a process applicable by the
 
04:05:42.420 --> 04:05:44.570 align:start position:0%
according to a process applicable by the
states

04:05:44.570 --> 04:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:05:46.610 --> 04:05:46.620 align:start position:0%
our contention is we have reached that
 
04:05:49.010 --> 04:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
point we've reached the point
 
04:05:51.790 --> 04:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
where we need a Convention of the states
 
04:05:54.710 --> 04:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
to impose fiscal restraints on the
 
04:05:56.929 --> 04:05:56.939 align:start position:0%
federal government to limit Federal
 
04:06:00.290 --> 04:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
power returning it to the states and to
 
04:06:02.630 --> 04:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
establish term limits for the federal
 
04:06:02.640 --> 04:06:03.889 align:start position:0%
establish term limits for the federal
officials

04:06:03.889 --> 04:06:03.899 align:start position:0%
officials
 
04:06:06.830 --> 04:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
these are issues rightfully to be
 
04:06:09.290 --> 04:06:09.300 align:start position:0%
discussed in a convention
 
04:06:12.050 --> 04:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
I'm open to any questions but as you
 
04:06:14.809 --> 04:06:14.819 align:start position:0%
know chairman we have several highly
 
04:06:17.389 --> 04:06:17.399 align:start position:0%
qualified candidates here including
 
04:06:20.030 --> 04:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
Michael Ferris one of the co-founders of
 
04:06:22.729 --> 04:06:22.739 align:start position:0%
Convention of States organization and
 
04:06:25.729 --> 04:06:25.739 align:start position:0%
many others so I'll answer whatever
 
04:06:27.769 --> 04:06:27.779 align:start position:0%
questions you have but
 
04:06:31.189 --> 04:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
they may be better Suited
 
04:06:31.199 --> 04:06:32.570 align:start position:0%
they may be better Suited
especially

04:06:32.570 --> 04:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
especially
 
04:06:37.490 --> 04:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:39.590 --> 04:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
okay Shane on thank you representative
 
04:06:41.689 --> 04:06:41.699 align:start position:0%
there are questions that will come up
 
04:06:43.490 --> 04:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
about a runaway convention I'm not going
 
04:06:46.189 --> 04:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
to I know some of us have that question
 
04:06:48.290 --> 04:06:48.300 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to have it posed now I
 
04:06:50.689 --> 04:06:50.699 align:start position:0%
know it's going to be addressed uh in a
 
04:06:53.990 --> 04:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
bit uh what we're going to do here is
 
04:06:56.030 --> 04:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
um typically our tradition is if we have
 
04:06:58.969 --> 04:06:58.979 align:start position:0%
Sitting reps who are looking to testify
 
04:07:02.510 --> 04:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
we try to get them uh up to the front
 
04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
um there are also a couple people who
 
04:07:06.349 --> 04:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
came a long way and have to leave early
 
04:07:08.990 --> 04:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to get them up to the front
 
04:07:12.710 --> 04:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
as well we have 20 plus folks who would
 
04:07:14.210 --> 04:07:14.220 align:start position:0%
like to speak which is great and it's
 
04:07:17.450 --> 04:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
great to see uh this turn out here I
 
04:07:20.269 --> 04:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
would ask that when it comes your turn
 
04:07:23.210 --> 04:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
to uh to speak and we're very much want
 
04:07:25.130 --> 04:07:25.140 align:start position:0%
to hear everybody speak that's why we're
 
04:07:27.590 --> 04:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
here uh if some of the points that you
 
04:07:30.050 --> 04:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
wanted to make have been made before you
 
04:07:32.570 --> 04:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
don't need to repeat them necessarily so
 
04:07:34.250 --> 04:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
and I notice in the cards many of you
 
04:07:36.590 --> 04:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
have only asked for one minute which is
 
04:07:38.990 --> 04:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh which is one wonderful if you can be
 
04:07:41.210 --> 04:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
that succinct and that organized
 
04:07:44.330 --> 04:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
so all that said I'd like to go to Mr
 
04:07:46.309 --> 04:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
Michael Ferris who's here from Virginia
 
04:07:49.490 --> 04:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
now he's asked for 10 plus minutes
 
04:07:53.030 --> 04:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
if we can make that 10 my 10 minus
 
04:07:56.809 --> 04:07:56.819 align:start position:0%
minutes Mr Ferris but we want you to
 
04:07:59.750 --> 04:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
There He Is We you came a long way and
 
04:08:02.210 --> 04:08:02.220 align:start position:0%
we wanted and you know this material we
 
04:08:03.769 --> 04:08:03.779 align:start position:0%
want to hear what you have to say so uh
 
04:08:10.130 --> 04:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:11.990 --> 04:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and members of the committee
 
04:08:14.809 --> 04:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for holding this
 
04:08:16.610 --> 04:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
wonderful meeting this great room this
 
04:08:17.929 --> 04:08:17.939 align:start position:0%
is terrific when I was here before
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
several years ago we were downstairs in
 
04:08:21.469 --> 04:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
a much smaller room this is terrific
 
04:08:23.570 --> 04:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity
 
04:08:26.269 --> 04:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
I am an attorney been in practice since
 
04:08:29.450 --> 04:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
1976 so that's getting uh close to 50
 
04:08:31.490 --> 04:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
years I've argued two cases
 
04:08:32.750 --> 04:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional cases in the Supreme
 
04:08:34.250 --> 04:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
Court of the United States and I've
 
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
litigated the Article 5 issue in the
 
04:08:40.670 --> 04:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
past in the early late 1970s when
 
04:08:42.410 --> 04:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
Congress tried to change the deadline
 
04:08:44.570 --> 04:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
for the ratification of the Equal Rights
 
04:08:47.210 --> 04:08:47.220 align:start position:0%
Amendment going from seven years to ten
 
04:08:50.030 --> 04:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
and a half years I represented several
 
04:08:51.469 --> 04:08:51.479 align:start position:0%
legislators from the state of Washington
 
04:08:53.689 --> 04:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
in a case that got Consolidated together
 
04:08:57.189 --> 04:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
with a similar case in Idaho and Arizona
 
04:09:01.610 --> 04:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
and worked together in the net finding
 
04:09:03.889 --> 04:09:03.899 align:start position:0%
of that case was you can't change the
 
04:09:05.570 --> 04:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
rules in the middle of the stream and
 
04:09:07.490 --> 04:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
that was the the holding of the federal
 
04:09:09.110 --> 04:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
district court it went to the Supreme
 
04:09:10.790 --> 04:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
Court of the United States and the
 
04:09:12.710 --> 04:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court made a summary ruling
 
04:09:14.630 --> 04:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
because the second deadline passed and
 
04:09:17.450 --> 04:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
they held basically that the era had
 
04:09:20.630 --> 04:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
expired and so that the the prior
 
04:09:23.090 --> 04:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
decision stances of persuasive but not
 
04:09:24.050 --> 04:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
binding process
 
04:09:26.030 --> 04:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's one of the more important
 
04:09:28.070 --> 04:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
precedences Article Five and so I'm one
 
04:09:29.450 --> 04:09:29.460 align:start position:0%
of the rare lawyers in the in the
 
04:09:31.189 --> 04:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
country that is actually litigated in
 
04:09:33.349 --> 04:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
researched on Article Five in addition
 
04:09:35.870 --> 04:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
and this is germane to The Runaway
 
04:09:38.330 --> 04:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
convention I published an article in the
 
04:09:40.010 --> 04:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
Harvard Journal of Law and public policy
 
04:09:42.410 --> 04:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
to definitively answer kind of the
 
04:09:45.650 --> 04:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
Baseline question of whether or not the
 
04:09:47.750 --> 04:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
original constitutional convention was a
 
04:09:50.330 --> 04:09:50.340 align:start position:0%
runaway I mean the theory goes well it
 
04:09:52.550 --> 04:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
was they were only supposed to amend the
 
04:09:54.710 --> 04:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
Articles of Confederation and instead
 
04:09:56.210 --> 04:09:56.220 align:start position:0%
they wrote a whole new document that's
 
04:09:58.070 --> 04:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
the the Genesis of a lot of the
 
04:10:00.410 --> 04:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
arguments that raised about the runaway
 
04:10:02.570 --> 04:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
convention it's just simply historically
 
04:10:03.769 --> 04:10:03.779 align:start position:0%
not true
 
04:10:03.779 --> 04:10:05.269 align:start position:0%
not true
the

04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:10:07.849 --> 04:10:07.859 align:start position:0%
uh as we all probably remember from our
 
04:10:10.969 --> 04:10:10.979 align:start position:0%
history uh the Annapolis convention was
 
04:10:13.309 --> 04:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
held uh previous to that they had been
 
04:10:16.189 --> 04:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
given of the delegates and given uh
 
04:10:17.750 --> 04:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility by their various States
 
04:10:19.790 --> 04:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
Authority by their states to discuss
 
04:10:22.729 --> 04:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
problems with Commerce we needed to have
 
04:10:24.530 --> 04:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
a different mechanism for regulating
 
04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
Commerce the delegates got together and
 
04:10:29.030 --> 04:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
said we don't have enough authority to
 
04:10:30.710 --> 04:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
solve the real problems and so they went
 
04:10:32.870 --> 04:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
back to their states and asked for more
 
04:10:34.969 --> 04:10:34.979 align:start position:0%
Authority and their The Authority they
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
asked for was to render the Federal
 
04:10:39.229 --> 04:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
Constitution adequate for the exigencies
 
04:10:40.689 --> 04:10:40.699 align:start position:0%
of the Union
 
04:10:42.889 --> 04:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
several states started passing
 
04:10:45.110 --> 04:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
resolutions calling for a convention in
 
04:10:48.349 --> 04:10:48.359 align:start position:0%
May of 1787 in Philadelphia for that
 
04:10:49.729 --> 04:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
purpose to render the Federal
 
04:10:51.469 --> 04:10:51.479 align:start position:0%
Constitution advocate for the
 
04:10:54.070 --> 04:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
existencies of the Union Six States
 
04:10:57.290 --> 04:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
called for that convention named their
 
04:10:59.389 --> 04:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
delegates gave their delegates their
 
04:11:02.150 --> 04:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
various voting instructions and then at
 
04:11:03.830 --> 04:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
that point the Articles of Confederation
 
04:11:07.429 --> 04:11:07.439 align:start position:0%
Congress passed the resolution that has
 
04:11:09.530 --> 04:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
the language only amend the Articles of
 
04:11:11.510 --> 04:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
Confederation that's where it comes from
 
04:11:13.090 --> 04:11:13.100 align:start position:0%
it's from that Congressional resolution
 
04:11:15.830 --> 04:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
now when Congress the Articles of
 
04:11:17.630 --> 04:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
Confederation Congress wanted to
 
04:11:19.010 --> 04:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
communicate to the states and ask the
 
04:11:20.809 --> 04:11:20.819 align:start position:0%
states to do something they had a
 
04:11:25.309 --> 04:11:25.319 align:start position:0%
process of passing two resolutions the
 
04:11:27.170 --> 04:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
substantive resolution and then they
 
04:11:29.090 --> 04:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
have voted and approved official letter
 
04:11:33.170 --> 04:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
of communication Congress never passed a
 
04:11:35.210 --> 04:11:35.220 align:start position:0%
resolution of communication of the
 
04:11:38.870 --> 04:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
resolution because it wasn't intended as
 
04:11:41.389 --> 04:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
a request for the states it was like a
 
04:11:43.969 --> 04:11:43.979 align:start position:0%
congressional resolution today endorsing
 
04:11:46.010 --> 04:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
National pickle week or something it was
 
04:11:49.189 --> 04:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
Express expressing the the beliefs of
 
04:11:50.929 --> 04:11:50.939 align:start position:0%
Congress about it but it was not a
 
04:11:52.670 --> 04:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
binding document we should all know that
 
04:11:55.309 --> 04:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
under the Articles of Confederation the
 
04:11:57.349 --> 04:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
Articles of Confederation Congress had
 
04:11:59.929 --> 04:11:59.939 align:start position:0%
no residual or implied powers to do
 
04:12:02.870 --> 04:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
anything they had no power to call a
 
04:12:05.469 --> 04:12:05.479 align:start position:0%
convention or anything else and so after
 
04:12:08.929 --> 04:12:08.939 align:start position:0%
they gave their resolution the rest of
 
04:12:10.490 --> 04:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
the states continued and New Hampshire
 
04:12:12.650 --> 04:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
was one of them continue and New
 
04:12:15.110 --> 04:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire told its delegates to render
 
04:12:16.910 --> 04:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
the Federal Constitution adequate for
 
04:12:18.830 --> 04:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
the existencies of the union and that's
 
04:12:20.809 --> 04:12:20.819 align:start position:0%
what they did and this article goes into
 
04:12:24.889 --> 04:12:24.899 align:start position:0%
great detail to prove that the delegates
 
04:12:27.469 --> 04:12:27.479 align:start position:0%
officially obeyed their Instructions Not
 
04:12:28.910 --> 04:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
only on subject matter but our own
 
04:12:31.189 --> 04:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
voting process as well the delegates can
 
04:12:33.050 --> 04:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
be held to be faithful New York for
 
04:12:35.389 --> 04:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
example said that all three delegates
 
04:12:38.330 --> 04:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
from their state that included Alexander
 
04:12:39.950 --> 04:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
Hamilton and Yates won another man's
 
04:12:43.130 --> 04:12:43.140 align:start position:0%
names escaping at the moment the three
 
04:12:45.110 --> 04:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
of them all had to be present in voting
 
04:12:47.150 --> 04:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
for New York to cast its one state one
 
04:12:51.050 --> 04:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
vote vote and two of them got mad at the
 
04:12:53.389 --> 04:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
way things were going they left new art
 
04:12:55.729 --> 04:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
never voted again so Alexander Hamilton
 
04:12:57.830 --> 04:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
never tried to cast the vote because
 
04:13:00.469 --> 04:13:00.479 align:start position:0%
that would be violating the standards of
 
04:13:02.330 --> 04:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
the state of New York set upon its
 
04:13:05.150 --> 04:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
delegates the the rules that states give
 
04:13:06.950 --> 04:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
their delegates have to be followed in
 
04:13:08.689 --> 04:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
the historical precedent is absolutely
 
04:13:10.490 --> 04:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
without exception
 
04:13:10.500 --> 04:13:12.229 align:start position:0%
without exception
so

04:13:12.229 --> 04:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:13:15.590 --> 04:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
um the and there's a similar answer it
 
04:13:17.750 --> 04:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
takes a long time to explain as to why
 
04:13:19.790 --> 04:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
the ratification process was proper as
 
04:13:22.670 --> 04:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
well the short answer is the 1787
 
04:13:24.229 --> 04:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention proposed two
 
04:13:26.570 --> 04:13:26.580 align:start position:0%
documents not the Constitution was one
 
04:13:29.870 --> 04:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
and a methodology of ratification was a
 
04:13:32.090 --> 04:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
second the Congress under Articles of
 
04:13:34.250 --> 04:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
Confederation unanimously approved the
 
04:13:36.229 --> 04:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
methodology only didn't vote on the
 
04:13:37.790 --> 04:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution sentenced to the state
 
04:13:40.550 --> 04:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
legislatures all 13 state legislatures
 
04:13:42.830 --> 04:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
approved the new ratification process
 
04:13:44.450 --> 04:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
which is the way had to be done in an
 
04:13:46.429 --> 04:13:46.439 align:start position:0%
articles Confederation Congress in all
 
04:13:48.650 --> 04:13:48.660 align:start position:0%
13 states had to approve any change in
 
04:13:51.349 --> 04:13:51.359 align:start position:0%
process that's what happened and then it
 
04:13:53.330 --> 04:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
was sent to the state ratification
 
04:13:56.210 --> 04:13:56.220 align:start position:0%
conventions and and and we all know that
 
04:13:58.969 --> 04:13:58.979 align:start position:0%
It ultimately got ratified so the whole
 
04:14:00.889 --> 04:14:00.899 align:start position:0%
runaway convention mess is
 
04:14:03.050 --> 04:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
anti-historical and frankly it's
 
04:14:04.790 --> 04:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
defamatory of the Constitution of the
 
04:14:06.410 --> 04:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
United States because if it was a
 
04:14:08.510 --> 04:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
runaway convention then the Constitution
 
04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
of the United States was illegally
 
04:14:11.870 --> 04:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
adopted and I don't know why anybody
 
04:14:12.769 --> 04:14:12.779 align:start position:0%
would call themselves a
 
04:14:14.570 --> 04:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
constitutionalist I don't know why
 
04:14:16.849 --> 04:14:16.859 align:start position:0%
anybody would swear an oath to uphold
 
04:14:18.170 --> 04:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
and defend the Constitution of the
 
04:14:19.910 --> 04:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
United States and contend it was
 
04:14:22.130 --> 04:14:22.140 align:start position:0%
illegally adopted you are not a
 
04:14:23.630 --> 04:14:23.640 align:start position:0%
constitutionalist if you think it was
 
04:14:25.150 --> 04:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
illegally adopted You Are
 
04:14:27.950 --> 04:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
anti-constitutionalist by definition and
 
04:14:29.330 --> 04:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
so the people that are spreading these
 
04:14:31.309 --> 04:14:31.319 align:start position:0%
rumors about a Runway convention do not
 
04:14:33.410 --> 04:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
know the law do not know the history and
 
04:14:35.210 --> 04:14:35.220 align:start position:0%
they are
 
04:14:37.370 --> 04:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
putting forth propaganda of people who
 
04:14:38.870 --> 04:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
have been enemies of the Constitution
 
04:14:41.269 --> 04:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
for years and it's simply inappropriate
 
04:14:41.279 --> 04:14:42.710 align:start position:0%
for years and it's simply inappropriate
now

04:14:42.710 --> 04:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:14:44.809 --> 04:14:44.819 align:start position:0%
why do we need this convention at this
 
04:14:46.729 --> 04:14:46.739 align:start position:0%
particular time the sponsor gave you
 
04:14:49.370 --> 04:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
good reason but I'll just say this the
 
04:14:52.250 --> 04:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
reason that George Mason and others said
 
04:14:54.410 --> 04:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
that we need to give the states the
 
04:14:56.750 --> 04:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
authority to amend the Constitution is
 
04:14:57.889 --> 04:14:57.899 align:start position:0%
the federal government going to abuse
 
04:15:01.670 --> 04:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
its power now think of I have 10 kids 29
 
04:15:03.349 --> 04:15:03.359 align:start position:0%
grandkids you take over America your way
 
04:15:07.130 --> 04:15:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:10.370 --> 04:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
um think of what would happen if I never
 
04:15:12.769 --> 04:15:12.779 align:start position:0%
disciplined my 10 children
 
04:15:15.410 --> 04:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
they would grow up not to be pretty
 
04:15:17.570 --> 04:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
Rowdy and inappropriate you couldn't
 
04:15:19.910 --> 04:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
trust what they were doing now for over
 
04:15:22.610 --> 04:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
200 years now the parent who are the
 
04:15:25.729 --> 04:15:25.739 align:start position:0%
states have never used Article 5 to
 
04:15:27.610 --> 04:15:27.620 align:start position:0%
discipline The Runaway of federal power
 
04:15:30.290 --> 04:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
and this convention needs to be called
 
04:15:32.929 --> 04:15:32.939 align:start position:0%
to show the Congress show the federal
 
04:15:35.689 --> 04:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
government there are limits here and we
 
04:15:37.729 --> 04:15:37.739 align:start position:0%
have the authority to change your mind
 
04:15:39.650 --> 04:15:39.660 align:start position:0%
we have the authority change your path
 
04:15:43.130 --> 04:15:43.140 align:start position:0%
pattern of behavior and the subject
 
04:15:44.570 --> 04:15:44.580 align:start position:0%
matters that we've given are limiting
 
04:15:46.670 --> 04:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
Federal power and for example my
 
04:15:49.130 --> 04:15:49.140 align:start position:0%
personal favorite is to impose a single
 
04:15:52.670 --> 04:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
subject rule on Congress to not let them
 
04:15:55.729 --> 04:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
pass the 1.7 trillion dollar package
 
04:15:57.530 --> 04:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
bills where they throw everything in the
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
Under the Sun in into it and that would
 
04:16:04.130 --> 04:16:04.140 align:start position:0%
not happen if you simply pass a single
 
04:16:05.990 --> 04:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
subject rule what's going to come out of
 
04:16:07.910 --> 04:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
this convention like this is going to be
 
04:16:10.070 --> 04:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
something short concise and
 
04:16:12.349 --> 04:16:12.359 align:start position:0%
commonsensical like that there might be
 
04:16:15.110 --> 04:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
two or three other things but what we're
 
04:16:17.090 --> 04:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
doing in this stage of the process is
 
04:16:19.250 --> 04:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
setting the agenda for discussion the
 
04:16:21.170 --> 04:16:21.180 align:start position:0%
agenda for discussion is fiscal
 
04:16:23.269 --> 04:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
restraints term limits not just on
 
04:16:25.490 --> 04:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
Congress but on all federal officials
 
04:16:27.550 --> 04:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
and other limitations on federal power
 
04:16:29.389 --> 04:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
it's safe
 
04:16:31.550 --> 04:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
we've litigated we've done the
 
04:16:33.530 --> 04:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
historical research if you have any
 
04:16:35.150 --> 04:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
questions of the article that I've been
 
04:16:37.010 --> 04:16:37.020 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'll give you my hard copy
 
04:16:40.010 --> 04:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
all the the documents been posted on
 
04:16:42.110 --> 04:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
your website or your link so you all
 
04:16:45.710 --> 04:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
have access to it and I would be glad to
 
04:16:47.389 --> 04:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you have thank
 
04:16:49.729 --> 04:16:49.739 align:start position:0%
you for this time Mr chairman thank you
 
04:16:52.490 --> 04:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
Ms Ferris questions for the uh for Mr
 
04:16:52.500 --> 04:16:54.229 align:start position:0%
Ms Ferris questions for the uh for Mr
Ferris

04:16:54.229 --> 04:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
Ferris
 
04:16:57.229 --> 04:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
representative NASA Miller
 
04:17:05.389 --> 04:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:07.729 --> 04:17:07.739 align:start position:0%
in this article five convention the
 
04:17:09.530 --> 04:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention and a
 
04:17:11.030 --> 04:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
Convention of states
 
04:17:11.040 --> 04:17:12.170 align:start position:0%
Convention of states
okay

04:17:12.170 --> 04:17:12.180 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:17:14.210 --> 04:17:14.220 align:start position:0%
um two of them are synonymous and
 
04:17:15.830 --> 04:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
Article 5 convention in the convention
 
04:17:17.450 --> 04:17:17.460 align:start position:0%
of the states are the same thing two
 
04:17:19.429 --> 04:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
names are the exactly the same thing a
 
04:17:21.410 --> 04:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention is what you
 
04:17:24.530 --> 04:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
would do if you were trying to rewrite
 
04:17:26.450 --> 04:17:26.460 align:start position:0%
the document entirely
 
04:17:29.330 --> 04:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
and in order to do that we would
 
04:17:30.950 --> 04:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
basically have to do the Revolutionary
 
04:17:32.990 --> 04:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
power under the article of the
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence where it
 
04:17:34.319 --> 04:17:35.090 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence where it
says

04:17:35.090 --> 04:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
says
 
04:17:36.469 --> 04:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
we'll get upset with the government they
 
04:17:39.050 --> 04:17:39.060 align:start position:0%
have the authority to to redo it that's
 
04:17:40.189 --> 04:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
what you'd have to do to have a
 
04:17:42.229 --> 04:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention to an
 
04:17:43.670 --> 04:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
amendments convention there's an
 
04:17:46.189 --> 04:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
amendance convention in in uh session
 
04:17:48.650 --> 04:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
right now it's called Congress
 
04:17:50.870 --> 04:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
and every day they're in session they
 
04:17:52.370 --> 04:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
can propose amendments to the
 
04:17:54.769 --> 04:17:54.779 align:start position:0%
Constitution the United States and so
 
04:17:58.370 --> 04:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
this would be a convention where the
 
04:18:00.170 --> 04:18:00.180 align:start position:0%
states pick who's there and the states
 
04:18:02.210 --> 04:18:02.220 align:start position:0%
get to control the agenda not Congress
 
04:18:03.590 --> 04:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
so the amendments are going to come from
 
04:18:05.330 --> 04:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
one place and ultimately for the
 
04:18:07.189 --> 04:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
resolution that we've proposed it
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
answers two questions who decides how
 
04:18:10.610 --> 04:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
much power the federal government should
 
04:18:12.349 --> 04:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
have should Congress decide how much
 
04:18:13.490 --> 04:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
power the federal government should have
 
04:18:15.170 --> 04:18:15.180 align:start position:0%
or should the states for this convention
 
04:18:17.570 --> 04:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
process decide and I think this High
 
04:18:19.969 --> 04:18:19.979 align:start position:0%
time that the states say we're going to
 
04:18:21.889 --> 04:18:21.899 align:start position:0%
do it do it ourselves so our article 5
 
04:18:23.809 --> 04:18:23.819 align:start position:0%
convention convention states exactly the
 
04:18:25.790 --> 04:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
same thing the founders called it a
 
04:18:27.710 --> 04:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
Convention of states and that's when
 
04:18:30.349 --> 04:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
um I basically wrote the text that
 
04:18:32.330 --> 04:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
you've got before you when writing that
 
04:18:33.950 --> 04:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
that's why we called it that because of
 
04:18:36.349 --> 04:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
the historical use by the founders
 
04:18:37.809 --> 04:18:37.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:18:41.150 --> 04:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
Spirits if this proposed convention were
 
04:18:42.410 --> 04:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
to occur
 
04:18:44.689 --> 04:18:44.699 align:start position:0%
who would be the convener or the
 
04:18:47.090 --> 04:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
convening officer and where would it be
 
04:18:48.950 --> 04:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
held who would determine where it would
 
04:18:50.510 --> 04:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
be held
 
04:18:53.650 --> 04:18:53.660 align:start position:0%
well the uh when there are 34 states
 
04:18:55.969 --> 04:18:55.979 align:start position:0%
that call for a convention for the same
 
04:18:57.950 --> 04:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
purpose now there are hundreds probably
 
04:19:00.110 --> 04:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
about 500
 
04:19:03.110 --> 04:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
current valid resolutions that call for
 
04:19:04.670 --> 04:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
Convention of the states on a lot of
 
04:19:06.830 --> 04:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
different topics and they don't they
 
04:19:08.809 --> 04:19:08.819 align:start position:0%
don't call us and so the reason you
 
04:19:10.670 --> 04:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
can't have a runaway you can't call us
 
04:19:12.290 --> 04:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
to call a convention you can't change
 
04:19:13.849 --> 04:19:13.859 align:start position:0%
the subject matter
 
04:19:17.090 --> 04:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
uh at the convention either but the
 
04:19:18.950 --> 04:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
Congress calls the convention they would
 
04:19:21.170 --> 04:19:21.180 align:start position:0%
name the time they would name at least
 
04:19:24.229 --> 04:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
the initial place that it meets the
 
04:19:26.330 --> 04:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
convention itself at that point in time
 
04:19:29.090 --> 04:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
once they convene could adjourn to
 
04:19:30.309 --> 04:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
another location
 
04:19:33.530 --> 04:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
and so if if for example they decide to
 
04:19:36.050 --> 04:19:36.060 align:start position:0%
put it in Washington DC I don't think
 
04:19:38.510 --> 04:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
that's a particularly good idea I think
 
04:19:40.969 --> 04:19:40.979 align:start position:0%
that there'd be a lot of momentum for
 
04:19:43.370 --> 04:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
moving to a a different location outside
 
04:19:46.969 --> 04:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
the Beltway and and so but the the
 
04:19:51.050 --> 04:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
states themselves would decide the rules
 
04:19:53.630 --> 04:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
I I uh there are a lot of states that
 
04:19:55.550 --> 04:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
are looking at passing a recommended
 
04:19:57.410 --> 04:19:57.420 align:start position:0%
rules package and if enough States
 
04:19:59.269 --> 04:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
commit themselves to a particular rules
 
04:20:01.670 --> 04:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
package beforehand it's like the
 
04:20:03.349 --> 04:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
delegate limitation acts the number of
 
04:20:04.990 --> 04:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
states are passing
 
04:20:08.150 --> 04:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
and we're working on a complete rules
 
04:20:10.610 --> 04:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
package our organization has sponsored
 
04:20:12.830 --> 04:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
the Article 5 compendium that's all the
 
04:20:15.650 --> 04:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
log if you want a full compendium all
 
04:20:16.910 --> 04:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
along the subject we have it available
 
04:20:19.090 --> 04:20:19.100 align:start position:0%
for you and
 
04:20:22.370 --> 04:20:22.380 align:start position:0%
we're working on a package of rules to
 
04:20:24.170 --> 04:20:24.180 align:start position:0%
make it happen but in the meantime
 
04:20:25.790 --> 04:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
probably the Mason's rules of
 
04:20:27.769 --> 04:20:27.779 align:start position:0%
legislative practice that would be in
 
04:20:27.779 --> 04:20:29.689 align:start position:0%
legislative practice that would be in
control

04:20:29.689 --> 04:20:29.699 align:start position:0%
control
 
04:20:32.090 --> 04:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
04:20:33.710 --> 04:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
representative Kerry
 
04:20:35.929 --> 04:20:35.939 align:start position:0%

04:21:05.510 --> 04:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
you said that information
 
04:21:08.450 --> 04:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
the organization is Convention of States
 
04:21:11.750 --> 04:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
cos action.org is that right
 
04:21:14.570 --> 04:21:14.580 align:start position:0%

organization in the world and so but I
 
04:21:29.510 --> 04:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
retired from being CEO I could actually
 
04:21:32.389 --> 04:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
be a lawyer again uh so
 
04:21:35.570 --> 04:21:35.580 align:start position:0%

I'm a resident of Salem New Hampshire
 
04:22:32.750 --> 04:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
and I am grateful
 
04:22:34.729 --> 04:22:34.739 align:start position:0%
for this opportunity to present my
 
04:22:37.910 --> 04:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
testimony to this assembly in support of
 
04:22:37.920 --> 04:22:40.670 align:start position:0%
testimony to this assembly in support of
hcr1

04:22:40.670 --> 04:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
hcr1
 
04:22:43.490 --> 04:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
it is my deep conviction that America is
 
04:22:45.950 --> 04:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
now at a Crossroads from which there
 
04:22:48.110 --> 04:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
could well be no return
 
04:22:49.969 --> 04:22:49.979 align:start position:0%
we find ourselves once again living
 
04:22:52.969 --> 04:22:52.979 align:start position:0%
under a tyrannical central government
 
04:22:55.130 --> 04:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
not unlike the one we threw off during
 
04:22:56.929 --> 04:22:56.939 align:start position:0%
the revolution
 
04:22:59.630 --> 04:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
now is the time to reclaim our power as
 
04:23:03.889 --> 04:23:03.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:05.809 --> 04:23:05.819 align:start position:0%
we as Citizens at the time of our
 
04:23:08.929 --> 04:23:08.939 align:start position:0%
founding created our federal government
 
04:23:11.510 --> 04:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
we created this body for the purpose of
 
04:23:13.729 --> 04:23:13.739 align:start position:0%
serving our several sovereign states by
 
04:23:15.889 --> 04:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
providing a National Defense in making
 
04:23:19.309 --> 04:23:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:19.319 --> 04:23:20.929 align:start position:0%
 
instead

04:23:20.929 --> 04:23:20.939 align:start position:0%
instead
 
04:23:22.729 --> 04:23:22.739 align:start position:0%
we find ourselves burdened by heavy
 
04:23:25.910 --> 04:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
taxes in innumerable regulations many of
 
04:23:28.550 --> 04:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
which do not serve the common good
 
04:23:30.710 --> 04:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
often our tax money is spent to
 
04:23:32.870 --> 04:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
Institute initiatives which go against
 
04:23:35.389 --> 04:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
our deeply held beliefs and our natural
 
04:23:37.370 --> 04:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
rights to free speech and self-defense
 
04:23:40.250 --> 04:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
are being threatened
 
04:23:42.170 --> 04:23:42.180 align:start position:0%
for these and many other reasons we
 
04:23:44.030 --> 04:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
citizens working through our state
 
04:23:44.040 --> 04:23:45.769 align:start position:0%
citizens working through our state
legislators

04:23:45.769 --> 04:23:45.779 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
04:23:47.389 --> 04:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
need to rein in the federal government
 
04:23:49.309 --> 04:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
by proposing amendments to our original
 
04:23:52.429 --> 04:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
Constitution for this purpose we don't
 
04:23:54.650 --> 04:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
want to change our constitution we love
 
04:23:57.050 --> 04:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
our Constitution and I gave the same
 
04:23:59.450 --> 04:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
example is Mr Ferris so I won't repeat
 
04:23:59.460 --> 04:24:01.070 align:start position:0%
example is Mr Ferris so I won't repeat
it

04:24:01.070 --> 04:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:24:02.809 --> 04:24:02.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has an opportunity to
 
04:24:04.910 --> 04:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
become the 20th State to call for an
 
04:24:06.650 --> 04:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
article 5 Convention of states for the
 
04:24:08.269 --> 04:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
purpose of taking our sovereignty back
 
04:24:10.910 --> 04:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
as free American citizens
 
04:24:12.889 --> 04:24:12.899 align:start position:0%
it is not our goal to change our
 
04:24:14.870 --> 04:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
constitution but to see that the
 
04:24:16.130 --> 04:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
original structure of our government
 
04:24:19.309 --> 04:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
which is proposed therein is reinstated
 
04:24:21.189 --> 04:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
and preserved for future Generations
 
04:24:24.290 --> 04:24:24.300 align:start position:0%

today but I that's fine because I have
 
04:25:29.689 --> 04:25:29.699 align:start position:0%
an expertise in the Article 5 convention
 
04:25:31.969 --> 04:25:31.979 align:start position:0%
process what I'm passing out to you
 
04:25:33.290 --> 04:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
right now is the same thing that I gave
 
04:25:35.030 --> 04:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
you last week when I testified on a
 
04:25:36.710 --> 04:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
different Bill I'm not going to talk
 
04:25:38.330 --> 04:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
about that in my testimony but I want
 
04:25:40.490 --> 04:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
you to have that available as a quick
 
04:25:43.910 --> 04:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
reference guide for the plethora of
 
04:25:45.290 --> 04:25:45.300 align:start position:0%
misinformation that I'm sure you will
 
04:25:47.450 --> 04:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
hear about some of the views of the
 
04:25:49.790 --> 04:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
founders and other Scholars
 
04:25:52.490 --> 04:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
um you can refer to the quotes that are
 
04:25:55.729 --> 04:25:55.739 align:start position:0%
often misquoted in great detail and in

04:25:59.630 --> 04:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
sources
 
04:26:01.790 --> 04:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
um Mr Ferris gave a very good background
 
04:26:04.189 --> 04:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
on the theoretical
 
04:26:06.170 --> 04:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
um reasons why we know that an article 5
 
04:26:08.389 --> 04:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
convention can be limited and that is
 
04:26:10.550 --> 04:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
important but the main thing that I want
 
04:26:12.290 --> 04:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
to talk to you about today are the
 
04:26:14.510 --> 04:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
practical tools that allow for that
 
04:26:17.809 --> 04:26:17.819 align:start position:0%
enforcement to to uh be in effect and
 
04:26:19.790 --> 04:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
the reason why we know that we can trust
 
04:26:22.550 --> 04:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
the process to ensure that will happen
 
04:26:24.530 --> 04:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
um the the way the founders wrote the
 
04:26:27.410 --> 04:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh they created a system of
 
04:26:29.689 --> 04:26:29.699 align:start position:0%
checks and balances and a distribution
 
04:26:31.849 --> 04:26:31.859 align:start position:0%
of power between states and the state
 
04:26:33.229 --> 04:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
and federal government and different
 
04:26:35.870 --> 04:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
bodies and that creates what I call a
 
04:26:37.729 --> 04:26:37.739 align:start position:0%
safety net around the Article 5
 
04:26:40.849 --> 04:26:40.859 align:start position:0%
convention process not every protection
 
04:26:42.590 --> 04:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
is written as specifically into Article
 
04:26:45.950 --> 04:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
5 as an explicit protection instead
 
04:26:47.389 --> 04:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
they're written into the nature of how
 
04:26:49.550 --> 04:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
the government itself Works how Article
 
04:26:52.070 --> 04:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
5 Works how the entire process works and
 
04:26:53.929 --> 04:26:53.939 align:start position:0%
the four main bodies that have some
 
04:26:56.090 --> 04:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
ability and some authority to provide
 
04:26:58.670 --> 04:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
for that safety net are the courts the
 
04:27:01.189 --> 04:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
the Congress the delegates and the
 
04:27:02.870 --> 04:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
states and I want to tell you right up
 
04:27:04.490 --> 04:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
front I don't trust the courts and I
 
04:27:06.050 --> 04:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
don't trust the Congress and I don't
 
04:27:07.729 --> 04:27:07.739 align:start position:0%
trust the delegates and I don't trust
 
04:27:10.010 --> 04:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
the states what I trust is that Network
 
04:27:12.530 --> 04:27:12.540 align:start position:0%
that safety net of all of those working
 
04:27:14.570 --> 04:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
together in contention because it only
 
04:27:16.729 --> 04:27:16.739 align:start position:0%
takes one of them to enforce the
 
04:27:19.429 --> 04:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
limitations over the others to disagree
 
04:27:21.410 --> 04:27:21.420 align:start position:0%
with the others in order to prevent the
 
04:27:23.870 --> 04:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
process from leading to an amendment on
 
04:27:27.290 --> 04:27:27.300 align:start position:0%
another issue and that's why when I said
 
04:27:29.689 --> 04:27:29.699 align:start position:0%
to you last week 100 percent of
 
04:27:31.429 --> 04:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed Scholars agree that
 
04:27:33.649 --> 04:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
there's no way a new limited Article 5
 
04:27:35.330 --> 04:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
convention call like the one before you
 
04:27:37.250 --> 04:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
today could possibly lead to an
 
04:27:39.710 --> 04:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
amendment on another issue there is an
 
04:27:42.710 --> 04:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
enormous body of legal research on each
 
04:27:45.290 --> 04:27:45.300 align:start position:0%
of these different protections uh that
 
04:27:47.990 --> 04:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
that explains how the the process can be
 
04:27:50.750 --> 04:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
limited and why we know that
 
04:27:54.050 --> 04:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
um that the enforcement mechanisms can
 
04:27:57.170 --> 04:27:57.180 align:start position:0%
and will remain in place so first for
 
04:27:59.870 --> 04:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
the the courts
 
04:28:02.090 --> 04:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
um they're the courts have have checks
 
04:28:03.649 --> 04:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
and balances over several other parts of
 
04:28:05.210 --> 04:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
the process
 
04:28:07.309 --> 04:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of different types
 
04:28:08.929 --> 04:28:08.939 align:start position:0%
of conventions under the U.S
 
04:28:11.929 --> 04:28:11.939 align:start position:0%
Constitution and under the states and
 
04:28:14.090 --> 04:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
all of them have uh well each one of
 
04:28:16.370 --> 04:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
them is unique they all have some
 
04:28:19.189 --> 04:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
bearing on understanding how other types
 
04:28:21.950 --> 04:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
of conventions work and Florida as a
 
04:28:24.349 --> 04:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
state happens to have a State Convention
 
04:28:26.510 --> 04:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
that is very analogous to the article
 
04:28:28.910 --> 04:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
Cloud convention process every 20 years
 
04:28:30.710 --> 04:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
they have a convention that's limited
 
04:28:32.990 --> 04:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
specifically to budgetary issues under
 
04:28:35.510 --> 04:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
their constitution the convention meets
 
04:28:37.610 --> 04:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
only to propose amendments which then
 
04:28:40.610 --> 04:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
get sent on to the states uh in 2008
 
04:28:44.030 --> 04:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
that convention met and they proposed
 
04:28:45.290 --> 04:28:45.300 align:start position:0%
some amendments that the delegates
 
04:28:47.990 --> 04:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
believed were within their powers but
 
04:28:50.269 --> 04:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
some other people did not agree and they
 
04:28:52.250 --> 04:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
sued in the case was called Ford B
 
04:28:54.229 --> 04:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
Browning the state supreme court in
 
04:28:56.570 --> 04:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
Florida agreed that some of the
 
04:28:58.189 --> 04:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
amendments were fine and could be sent
 
04:29:01.610 --> 04:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
on to ratification other amendments I
 
04:29:03.469 --> 04:29:03.479 align:start position:0%
were outside of the scope and they
 
04:29:05.210 --> 04:29:05.220 align:start position:0%
enforced the delegate limitation rules
 
04:29:07.189 --> 04:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
that were in place in this analogous
 
04:29:09.410 --> 04:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
convention in Florida and did not allow
 
04:29:11.349 --> 04:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
those to be sent on for ratification
 
04:29:14.389 --> 04:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
there are also ways that the that the
 
04:29:16.729 --> 04:29:16.739 align:start position:0%
court system has uh powered over the
 
04:29:19.370 --> 04:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
checks that Congress has or has checks
 
04:29:21.889 --> 04:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
over the power Congress has in place
 
04:29:21.899 --> 04:29:22.490 align:start position:0%
over the power Congress has in place
um

04:29:22.490 --> 04:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:26.330 --> 04:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
the there's uh cases such as palabi
 
04:29:28.849 --> 04:29:28.859 align:start position:0%
McCormick which show the Congress able
 
04:29:31.610 --> 04:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
to use the declaratory judgment act to
 
04:29:34.010 --> 04:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
make it as if Congress acted in a
 
04:29:36.649 --> 04:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
situation where Congress has refused to
 
04:29:39.469 --> 04:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
do its ministerial duty of calling for a
 
04:29:39.479 --> 04:29:41.030 align:start position:0%
do its ministerial duty of calling for a
convention

04:29:41.030 --> 04:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
convention
 
04:29:43.670 --> 04:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
um and uh in in policy McCormick it was
 
04:29:45.110 --> 04:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
a different Duty obviously it was a duty
 
04:29:46.969 --> 04:29:46.979 align:start position:0%
to see a member of Congress and pay him
 
04:29:49.849 --> 04:29:49.859 align:start position:0%
his salary they could not make Congress
 
04:29:52.490 --> 04:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
act but in that case they made it as if
 
04:29:53.630 --> 04:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
Congress had done what they were
 
04:29:56.750 --> 04:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to do and therefore the clerk
 
04:29:58.790 --> 04:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
of Congress had to pay representative
 
04:30:02.149 --> 04:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
Powell his salary uh by virtue of that
 
04:30:02.159 --> 04:30:03.469 align:start position:0%
Powell his salary uh by virtue of that
act

04:30:03.469 --> 04:30:03.479 align:start position:0%
act
 
04:30:06.590 --> 04:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
um there there are also the case that I
 
04:30:08.389 --> 04:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned last week which was just in
 
04:30:10.610 --> 04:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
2020 unanimous by the Supreme Court see
 
04:30:12.950 --> 04:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
if all of you Washington which enforced
 
04:30:16.130 --> 04:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
delegate limitation uh procedures those
 
04:30:18.469 --> 04:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
procedures in that particular case it
 
04:30:20.929 --> 04:30:20.939 align:start position:0%
was in reference to the um to the
 
04:30:23.269 --> 04:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
convention to the uh electoral college
 
04:30:26.389 --> 04:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
but that same exact provision was copied
 
04:30:29.210 --> 04:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
virtually verbatim from delegate
 
04:30:31.010 --> 04:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
limitation instructions from Article 5
 
04:30:34.070 --> 04:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
ratification convention in in New Mexico
 
04:30:37.429 --> 04:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
from 1933 and that com uh that concept
 
04:30:40.809 --> 04:30:40.819 align:start position:0%
came originally from uh
 
04:30:43.910 --> 04:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
Baskin I want to make sure I'm saying
 
04:30:45.889 --> 04:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
possible in sorry I mispronounced it
 
04:30:46.969 --> 04:30:46.979 align:start position:0%
last time and I appreciate
 
04:30:48.830 --> 04:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative Kerry correcting me on
 
04:30:48.840 --> 04:30:50.389 align:start position:0%
representative Kerry correcting me on
that

04:30:50.389 --> 04:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:30:53.929 --> 04:30:53.939 align:start position:0%
um it came from from Concepts that were
 
04:30:55.309 --> 04:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
there as well as in numerous other
 
04:30:59.030 --> 04:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
states uh the the Congress has its role
 
04:31:01.010 --> 04:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
to play as well Congress has given the
 
04:31:02.830 --> 04:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
authority both to call the convention
 
04:31:06.530 --> 04:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
upon receiving of the sufficient number
 
04:31:08.769 --> 04:31:08.779 align:start position:0%
of applications and we've seen Congress
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
despite having hundreds of applications
 
04:31:15.290 --> 04:31:15.300 align:start position:0%
has not exercised a call and that is
 
04:31:18.410 --> 04:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
because presumably depending on who you
 
04:31:21.649 --> 04:31:21.659 align:start position:0%
ask uh they don't if for those who
 
04:31:24.530 --> 04:31:24.540 align:start position:0%
believe that different calls cannot be
 
04:31:27.530 --> 04:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
counted together as I do uh that's
 
04:31:30.429 --> 04:31:30.439 align:start position:0%
because they've not had 34 on any one
 
04:31:32.990 --> 04:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
subject matter for those who believe
 
04:31:34.429 --> 04:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
that different calls can be countered
 
04:31:36.710 --> 04:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
together in some ways then that's
 
04:31:38.469 --> 04:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
because Congress
 
04:31:41.389 --> 04:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
has not done its Duty
 
04:31:43.309 --> 04:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
um and if you are in that ladder Camp
 
04:31:45.889 --> 04:31:45.899 align:start position:0%
which I am not uh then a new article 5
 
04:31:47.570 --> 04:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
convention call on a different subject
 
04:31:49.309 --> 04:31:49.319 align:start position:0%
matter is irrelevant because the duty
 
04:31:51.769 --> 04:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
has already been triggered so which are
 
04:31:53.689 --> 04:31:53.699 align:start position:0%
whichever way you go and whichever Camp
 
04:31:55.130 --> 04:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
you agree with whether you agree with me
 
04:31:57.170 --> 04:31:57.180 align:start position:0%
or not on that issue
 
04:31:59.330 --> 04:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
um either way a new article 5 convention
 
04:32:02.149 --> 04:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
call could not trigger a convention that
 
04:32:03.410 --> 04:32:03.420 align:start position:0%
could lead to an amendment on any other
 
04:32:06.429 --> 04:32:06.439 align:start position:0%
subject uh Congress also has the power
 
04:32:09.950 --> 04:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
to regulate the convention process there
 
04:32:11.689 --> 04:32:11.699 align:start position:0%
have been numerous bills introduced in
 
04:32:13.790 --> 04:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
Congress over the years it's past the
 
04:32:16.670 --> 04:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
Senate unanimously twice I'm going to
 
04:32:18.349 --> 04:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
talk in more detail next week when I
 
04:32:20.510 --> 04:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
come back to talk about regulations
 
04:32:23.929 --> 04:32:23.939 align:start position:0%
about Senator Chuck Schumer and
 
04:32:25.670 --> 04:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
President Biden's views they've
 
04:32:27.769 --> 04:32:27.779 align:start position:0%
expressed on those kinds of regulations
 
04:32:30.229 --> 04:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
they were both in support of it as were
 
04:32:31.610 --> 04:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
many on the on the other side of the
 
04:32:33.229 --> 04:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
aisle as well
 
04:32:33.239 --> 04:32:34.210 align:start position:0%
aisle as well
um

04:32:34.210 --> 04:32:34.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:38.269 --> 04:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
and I those regulations like I said past
 
04:32:40.330 --> 04:32:40.340 align:start position:0%
the Senate unanimously twice they were
 
04:32:42.170 --> 04:32:42.180 align:start position:0%
uncontroversial supported by the
 
04:32:44.330 --> 04:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
American Bar Association
 
04:32:46.490 --> 04:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
um the ability to regulate this process
 
04:32:49.490 --> 04:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
is generally pretty well recognized uh
 
04:32:52.090 --> 04:32:52.100 align:start position:0%
Congress also has the ability to send um
 
04:32:54.830 --> 04:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
the the amendment on to the states and
 
04:32:56.330 --> 04:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
there's limitations over that process
 
04:32:58.550 --> 04:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's also a process that has been tried
 
04:33:01.729 --> 04:33:01.739 align:start position:0%
and true and well well known and you
 
04:33:03.469 --> 04:33:03.479 align:start position:0%
heard testimony about that already today
 
04:33:04.970 --> 04:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
about how that works and what the
 
04:33:07.010 --> 04:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
limitations are on it and court cases
 
04:33:08.449 --> 04:33:08.459 align:start position:0%
that have been litigated over that
 
04:33:10.369 --> 04:33:10.379 align:start position:0%
process there's quite a few that have
 
04:33:13.189 --> 04:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
been litigated over that process uh then
 
04:33:15.650 --> 04:33:15.660 align:start position:0%
there's the delegates I'm gonna I'm not
 
04:33:17.269 --> 04:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
going to talk much about delegates the
 
04:33:19.250 --> 04:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
moment because I'm going to go into more
 
04:33:20.929 --> 04:33:20.939 align:start position:0%
detail on that next week when we talk
 
04:33:24.529 --> 04:33:24.539 align:start position:0%
about delegate limitation statute
 
04:33:26.570 --> 04:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
um but there are protections over the
 
04:33:28.310 --> 04:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
delegates that we will get into into
 
04:33:30.769 --> 04:33:30.779 align:start position:0%
detail on then and then finally there's
 
04:33:32.869 --> 04:33:32.879 align:start position:0%
yourselves there's the states
 
04:33:36.529 --> 04:33:36.539 align:start position:0%
um you have the role first to change uh
 
04:33:37.849 --> 04:33:37.859 align:start position:0%
things about the country about the way
 
04:33:39.470 --> 04:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
the Constitution Works through the
 
04:33:41.150 --> 04:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
amendment process through the power that
 
04:33:44.750 --> 04:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
was given to you as co-equal sovereigns
 
04:33:46.369 --> 04:33:46.379 align:start position:0%
the states and the federal government
 
04:33:49.310 --> 04:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
together both have equal power to amend
 
04:33:50.990 --> 04:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
the Constitution
 
04:33:53.390 --> 04:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
um and both have equal power to propose
 
04:33:55.970 --> 04:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
uh amendments that are limited to
 
04:33:57.529 --> 04:33:57.539 align:start position:0%
whatever subject matter you want to
 
04:34:00.349 --> 04:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
limit your authority to do
 
04:34:00.359 --> 04:34:01.131 align:start position:0%
limit your authority to do
um

04:34:01.131 --> 04:34:01.141 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:04.131 --> 04:34:04.141 align:start position:0%
you also have the the power to ratify
 
04:34:05.750 --> 04:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
anything that comes from a convention
 
04:34:07.730 --> 04:34:07.740 align:start position:0%
just as you have the power to ratify
 
04:34:10.189 --> 04:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
anything that comes from uh from
 
04:34:11.929 --> 04:34:11.939 align:start position:0%
Congress just as Congress couldn't
 
04:34:14.810 --> 04:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
propose something and then change the
 
04:34:17.570 --> 04:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
ratification procedure they have two
 
04:34:19.070 --> 04:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
things in Congress they have the
 
04:34:21.289 --> 04:34:21.299 align:start position:0%
amendment by two-thirds and then a
 
04:34:23.029 --> 04:34:23.039 align:start position:0%
simple majority to propose the method of
 
04:34:25.250 --> 04:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
ratification the method of ratification
 
04:34:26.990 --> 04:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
is limited to two options either the
 
04:34:28.970 --> 04:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
state legislatures or state conventions
 
04:34:31.369 --> 04:34:31.379 align:start position:0%
ratify they only have those two options
 
04:34:33.650 --> 04:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
they can't propose something else the
 
04:34:35.631 --> 04:34:35.641 align:start position:0%
convention is limited by the exact same
 
04:34:37.789 --> 04:34:37.799 align:start position:0%
provision in the Constitution to only
 
04:34:40.730 --> 04:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
those two options and nothing else and
 
04:34:44.390 --> 04:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
as you heard earlier today uh nothing
 
04:34:46.849 --> 04:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
about the 1787 Convention contradicts
 
04:34:49.429 --> 04:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
any of that indeed this provision was in
 
04:34:50.869 --> 04:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
place at that point it's a different
 
04:34:53.449 --> 04:34:53.459 align:start position:0%
type of convention so you have the
 
04:34:57.590 --> 04:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
ability there to uh to yourselves ratify
 
04:34:59.929 --> 04:34:59.939 align:start position:0%
anything that comes out of uh out of the
 
04:35:02.390 --> 04:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
convention and it needs to meet a very
 
04:35:04.209 --> 04:35:04.219 align:start position:0%
high bar of three quarters of the states
 
04:35:07.010 --> 04:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
think about two-thirds of the states
 
04:35:08.929 --> 04:35:08.939 align:start position:0%
call for convention limited to one
 
04:35:11.209 --> 04:35:11.219 align:start position:0%
subject matter you then need four other
 
04:35:11.219 --> 04:35:12.310 align:start position:0%
subject matter you then need four other
states

04:35:12.310 --> 04:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:35:15.170 --> 04:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
in that did not call for a convention on
 
04:35:17.810 --> 04:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
that issue of the remaining 16 a quarter
 
04:35:19.490 --> 04:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
of the other states that didn't even
 
04:35:21.830 --> 04:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
call for this issue to say you know what
 
04:35:24.709 --> 04:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
you guys did something so great that not
 
04:35:26.510 --> 04:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
only does every state that called for
 
04:35:29.929 --> 04:35:29.939 align:start position:0%
the convention agree so to form more uh
 
04:35:33.470 --> 04:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
so 25 of the others and if just one
 
04:35:35.570 --> 04:35:35.580 align:start position:0%
brand just one house in 13 different
 
04:35:38.510 --> 04:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
states do not want to see it passed they
 
04:35:40.730 --> 04:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
can block it because you need 38 States
 
04:35:42.650 --> 04:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
in order to ratify and without having to
 
04:35:44.090 --> 04:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you famous
 
04:35:48.170 --> 04:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
field another questions for Mr fieldman
 
04:35:50.269 --> 04:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
representative Kerry
 
04:35:52.730 --> 04:35:52.740 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to understand process if
 
04:35:54.470 --> 04:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
we go through this process of the
 
04:35:56.689 --> 04:35:56.699 align:start position:0%
convention of states can the federal
 
04:35:59.510 --> 04:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
government then revert what has been
 
04:36:02.689 --> 04:36:02.699 align:start position:0%
done by the convention of states
 
04:36:05.929 --> 04:36:05.939 align:start position:0%
um in in what way
 
04:36:08.029 --> 04:36:08.039 align:start position:0%
like not send it on the same way they
 
04:36:08.039 --> 04:36:08.750 align:start position:0%
like not send it on the same way they
are

04:36:08.750 --> 04:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:36:11.330 --> 04:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
just been the only body that has created
 
04:36:13.910 --> 04:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
amendments to the Constitution sure uh
 
04:36:16.310 --> 04:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
the they would have the same authority
 
04:36:18.650 --> 04:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
to us to propose an amendment as they
 
04:36:20.810 --> 04:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
always have historically what's happened
 
04:36:23.330 --> 04:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
is that when they've seen Article 5
 
04:36:25.490 --> 04:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
convention calls get very close they've
 
04:36:27.529 --> 04:36:27.539 align:start position:0%
benched to the will of people we've seen
 
04:36:29.090 --> 04:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
that with the Bill of Rights which
 
04:36:31.250 --> 04:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
Alexander Hamilton and John Jay called
 
04:36:32.750 --> 04:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
for the use of this process for the Bill
 
04:36:35.269 --> 04:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
of Rights we've seen that with the 17th
 
04:36:37.310 --> 04:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment we've seen that with uh other
 
04:36:39.289 --> 04:36:39.299 align:start position:0%
actions in Congress but furthermore
 
04:36:41.510 --> 04:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
anything that Congress proposes has the
 
04:36:43.490 --> 04:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
same limitations as things that are
 
04:36:47.570 --> 04:36:47.580 align:start position:0%
proposed by the states it cannot go it
 
04:36:49.910 --> 04:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
cannot be ratified unless 38 States
 
04:36:52.789 --> 04:36:52.799 align:start position:0%
agree to it so if the states use this
 
04:36:54.410 --> 04:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
process to get an amendment to the
 
04:36:56.390 --> 04:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
Constitution and Congress comes along
 
04:36:58.730 --> 04:36:58.740 align:start position:0%
and proposes changing it back the states
 
04:37:01.609 --> 04:37:01.619 align:start position:0%
can simply say no
 
04:37:06.590 --> 04:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:08.929 --> 04:37:08.939 align:start position:0%
seeing thank you Mr fieldman for coming
 
04:37:11.449 --> 04:37:11.459 align:start position:0%
here to testify this uh is by the way is
 
04:37:13.910 --> 04:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
being streamed it will be on YouTube so
 
04:37:16.789 --> 04:37:16.799 align:start position:0%
it's a potential nice civics lesson for
 
04:37:19.010 --> 04:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
those who uh want to understand this
 
04:37:21.230 --> 04:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
better we have three reps three
 
04:37:23.990 --> 04:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
legislators and if I missed anybody in
 
04:37:26.869 --> 04:37:26.879 align:start position:0%
the pile I apologize
 
04:37:29.631 --> 04:37:29.641 align:start position:0%
um we'll go there's one who is four one
 
04:37:32.330 --> 04:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
who was against and one was four we'll
 
04:37:34.250 --> 04:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
uh go in that order representative
 
04:37:36.109 --> 04:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
Finney asked for one minute to speak for
 
04:37:39.590 --> 04:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:39.600 --> 04:37:42.349 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:37:42.349 --> 04:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:37:44.750 --> 04:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon fellow committee members
 
04:37:47.150 --> 04:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
I am Brandon Finney from Stratford nine
 
04:37:50.090 --> 04:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
which is Rochester Ward 6. uh I come
 
04:37:52.070 --> 04:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
before you as a co-sponsor of the bill
 
04:37:54.109 --> 04:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
to uh to present you a few points that I
 
04:37:56.209 --> 04:37:56.219 align:start position:0%
think are poignant and a little more
 
04:37:58.910 --> 04:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
ethereal and not as a technical
 
04:38:02.269 --> 04:38:02.279 align:start position:0%
so I want to to reiterate that the
 
04:38:04.849 --> 04:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
purpose of convolving of calling a
 
04:38:07.189 --> 04:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
convention is to affirm states rights
 
04:38:09.650 --> 04:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
which we've heard about uh we as a free
 
04:38:11.150 --> 04:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
and individual sovereign state have the
 
04:38:12.890 --> 04:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
right to you know to govern ourselves
 
04:38:15.170 --> 04:38:15.180 align:start position:0%
outside our federal Authority
 
04:38:17.029 --> 04:38:17.039 align:start position:0%
it is important to maintain our checks
 
04:38:20.150 --> 04:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
on power we also have the right to tell
 
04:38:22.070 --> 04:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
the federal government that they're
 
04:38:23.449 --> 04:38:23.459 align:start position:0%
being tyrannical and they need to be
 
04:38:26.269 --> 04:38:26.279 align:start position:0%
reigned in and one way to do that
 
04:38:29.029 --> 04:38:29.039 align:start position:0%
is to amend our Constitution and to go
 
04:38:30.890 --> 04:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
through the the process that the
 
04:38:33.170 --> 04:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
founders had enough foresight into to
 
04:38:35.810 --> 04:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
realize that in future Generations we're
 
04:38:38.869 --> 04:38:38.879 align:start position:0%
going to have societal political
 
04:38:41.449 --> 04:38:41.459 align:start position:0%
and Technical evolution in our societies
 
04:38:43.369 --> 04:38:43.379 align:start position:0%
and that we'll need to update
 
04:38:45.890 --> 04:38:45.900 align:start position:0%
what the Constitution covers as we
 
04:38:49.369 --> 04:38:49.379 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:52.750 --> 04:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
the convention is specifically uh
 
04:38:55.551 --> 04:38:55.561 align:start position:0%
designed to be limited in specific
 
04:38:55.561 --> 04:38:56.689 align:start position:0%
designed to be limited in specific
topics

04:38:56.689 --> 04:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
topics
 
04:39:01.010 --> 04:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
so the the you know the the fear that of
 
04:39:02.631 --> 04:39:02.641 align:start position:0%
the runaway convention which we've heard
 
04:39:04.670 --> 04:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
about it's it's more of a buzzword now
 
04:39:06.230 --> 04:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
than anything else really has no value
 
04:39:10.070 --> 04:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:10.080 --> 04:39:11.269 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:39:11.269 --> 04:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:13.670 --> 04:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
we need to have fundamental changes
 
04:39:16.910 --> 04:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
to protect our future Generations
 
04:39:20.150 --> 04:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
from the the uh the the scope and power
 
04:39:21.830 --> 04:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
of the federal government
 
04:39:25.490 --> 04:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
and to do that is is to specifically
 
04:39:28.789 --> 04:39:28.799 align:start position:0%
rein in the corporatism and plutocracy
 
04:39:31.670 --> 04:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
that's invaded our modern society as
 
04:39:33.470 --> 04:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
we've allowed corporations to speak more
 
04:39:35.570 --> 04:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
for us than the individual and the
 
04:39:37.430 --> 04:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
individuals the smallest minority in our
 
04:39:39.770 --> 04:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
society that's not uh you know kid
 
04:39:41.990 --> 04:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
ourselves about that it's not groups
 
04:39:43.730 --> 04:39:43.740 align:start position:0%
it's individuals and as an individual we
 
04:39:46.670 --> 04:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
have the right to be protected uh
 
04:39:49.368 --> 04:39:49.378 align:start position:0%
from that tyrannical power State you
 
04:39:50.630 --> 04:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
know Federal
 
04:39:53.330 --> 04:39:53.340 align:start position:0%
or other individuals
 
04:39:56.448 --> 04:39:56.458 align:start position:0%
our natural rights are not at risk again
 
04:39:58.850 --> 04:39:58.860 align:start position:0%
the Bill of Rights is protected it's not
 
04:40:00.830 --> 04:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
going anywhere it cannot be changed it
 
04:40:02.090 --> 04:40:02.100 align:start position:0%
is fundamental
 
04:40:05.030 --> 04:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
and this is specifically talking about
 
04:40:07.130 --> 04:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
what the role of federal government is
 
04:40:09.948 --> 04:40:09.958 align:start position:0%
in our society in our economy and our
 
04:40:14.270 --> 04:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:15.830 --> 04:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
we want to stem
 
04:40:18.350 --> 04:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
political apathy and extremism in
 
04:40:20.690 --> 04:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
society by making the political process
 
04:40:23.868 --> 04:40:23.878 align:start position:0%
more inclusive not just to other groups
 
04:40:27.110 --> 04:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
and individuals but as the right of all
 
04:40:28.490 --> 04:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
citizens to be involved in their
 
04:40:29.930 --> 04:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
government I mean we can look around the
 
04:40:31.610 --> 04:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
room and see everybody that's involved
 
04:40:33.770 --> 04:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
here that cares about the Integrity of
 
04:40:36.470 --> 04:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
our future and our and and today and
 
04:40:38.810 --> 04:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
today we have serious problems we are 32
 
04:40:41.030 --> 04:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
trillion dollars in debt that is an
 
04:40:43.368 --> 04:40:43.378 align:start position:0%
unfathomable amount of money that will
 
04:40:45.288 --> 04:40:45.298 align:start position:0%
never be paid that could possibly
 
04:40:47.930 --> 04:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
collapse our entire economic system and
 
04:40:49.310 --> 04:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
the reason that is happening is because
 
04:40:51.410 --> 04:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
we've allowed our our federal government
 
04:40:54.890 --> 04:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
to be so involved and intertwined with
 
04:40:58.610 --> 04:40:58.620 align:start position:0%
private institutions that can funnel all
 
04:41:01.010 --> 04:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
of our Congressional campaigns that
 
04:41:03.230 --> 04:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
pretty much takes
 
04:41:08.868 --> 04:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
the policy out of it and uh uh excuse me
 
04:41:12.410 --> 04:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
and replaces it with corporate power we
 
04:41:13.788 --> 04:41:13.798 align:start position:0%
are not a corporation we are a
 
04:41:15.470 --> 04:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
government of the people and we need to
 
04:41:17.270 --> 04:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
change that we need to
 
04:41:19.310 --> 04:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
tell our federal government that they do
 
04:41:21.170 --> 04:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
not have power over us that we are a
 
04:41:23.330 --> 04:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
free and sovereign individual State and
 
04:41:24.590 --> 04:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
we will maintain that through the
 
04:41:27.288 --> 04:41:27.298 align:start position:0%
convention process uh I will yield any
 
04:41:29.448 --> 04:41:29.458 align:start position:0%
technical questions to The Experts I
 
04:41:33.290 --> 04:41:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:33.300 --> 04:41:36.770 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

04:41:36.770 --> 04:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:38.810 --> 04:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
thank you rep representative Finney a
 
04:41:41.330 --> 04:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor uh speaking against the
 
04:41:43.670 --> 04:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
measure uh representative Timothy Horgan
 
04:41:50.270 --> 04:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:52.490 --> 04:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much Mr chair
 
04:41:53.990 --> 04:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
04:41:55.850 --> 04:41:55.860 align:start position:0%
so I'm representative Timothy Horrigan
 
04:41:57.590 --> 04:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
I'm also from Stratford County but from
 
04:42:00.230 --> 04:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
District 10 which is the town of Durham
 
04:42:03.050 --> 04:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
and uh some of my I submitted these
 
04:42:04.910 --> 04:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
written remarks actually a week ago at
 
04:42:07.490 --> 04:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
the same time as the hearing for HV 269
 
04:42:09.530 --> 04:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
which is about uh
 
04:42:12.350 --> 04:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
a delegate limitation bill so my
 
04:42:14.448 --> 04:42:14.458 align:start position:0%
testimony and I submitted testimony of
 
04:42:15.948 --> 04:42:15.958 align:start position:0%
that bill too although I was unable to
 
04:42:17.690 --> 04:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
attend in person
 
04:42:20.990 --> 04:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
and uh it's about half the sponsors of
 
04:42:24.050 --> 04:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
the delegate limitation Bill HP 269 are
 
04:42:27.650 --> 04:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
also sponsors of this one and
 
04:42:29.990 --> 04:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
actually that feels somewhat 269
 
04:42:31.070 --> 04:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
somewhat different from another bill
 
04:42:32.330 --> 04:42:32.340 align:start position:0%
you're going to be hearing next week but
 
04:42:34.190 --> 04:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
you can worry about that one next week
 
04:42:36.410 --> 04:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
when that one comes so
 
04:42:38.330 --> 04:42:38.340 align:start position:0%
anyway I shared the basic concern of the
 
04:42:41.390 --> 04:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
HB 269 sponsors um which is Article Five
 
04:42:42.830 --> 04:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention can easily
 
04:42:44.628 --> 04:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
turn into a runaway convention and
 
04:42:47.150 --> 04:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
they're preferred solution was to impose
 
04:42:50.810 --> 04:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
an unworkable and set of rules on our
 
04:42:52.550 --> 04:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
state's convention delegates although
 
04:42:54.530 --> 04:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
that particular bill is like one that's
 
04:42:57.530 --> 04:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
passed many many times this house but so
 
04:42:59.930 --> 04:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
my preferred Solutions are one not to
 
04:43:01.730 --> 04:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
have an article five convention in the
 
04:43:03.050 --> 04:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
first place
 
04:43:05.868 --> 04:43:05.878 align:start position:0%
and number two to refuse to ratify any
 
04:43:07.970 --> 04:43:07.980 align:start position:0%
amendments produced by such a convention
 
04:43:10.070 --> 04:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
although I suppose I would be willing to
 
04:43:11.448 --> 04:43:11.458 align:start position:0%
make an exception if it was a good
 
04:43:11.458 --> 04:43:12.470 align:start position:0%
make an exception if it was a good
Amendment

04:43:12.470 --> 04:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:43:14.690 --> 04:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
it only takes 13 out of 50 states to
 
04:43:16.930 --> 04:43:16.940 align:start position:0%
block a constitutional amendment
 
04:43:20.628 --> 04:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
uh line 14 hcr1 as you know specifies
 
04:43:23.330 --> 04:43:23.340 align:start position:0%
we're applying to Congress
 
04:43:25.430 --> 04:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
so if this convention ever happened so I
 
04:43:26.990 --> 04:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
have to pursuant to an enabling Act
 
04:43:30.050 --> 04:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
passed by Congress and uh which means
 
04:43:31.070 --> 04:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
we'll have to send the number of
 
04:43:33.708 --> 04:43:33.718 align:start position:0%
delegates they allow us to send we have
 
04:43:34.970 --> 04:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
to choose them the way they tell us to
 
04:43:36.470 --> 04:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
send it and
 
04:43:38.750 --> 04:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
etc etc the rights and responsibilities
 
04:43:41.270 --> 04:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
will be basically whatever's
 
04:43:43.910 --> 04:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
convents its own rules uh states that
 
04:43:45.708 --> 04:43:45.718 align:start position:0%
can be outlined in the enabling act and
 
04:43:47.208 --> 04:43:47.218 align:start position:0%
then obviously fleshed out by the
 
04:43:48.350 --> 04:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
convention itself and their
 
04:43:48.360 --> 04:43:49.788 align:start position:0%
convention itself and their
responsibilities

04:43:49.788 --> 04:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
04:43:51.470 --> 04:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
are going to be basically much the same
 
04:43:53.208 --> 04:43:53.218 align:start position:0%
as those enjoyed by members of Congress
 
04:43:55.610 --> 04:43:55.620 align:start position:0%
and at state level by us you know the
 
04:43:56.930 --> 04:43:56.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire house
 
04:43:58.850 --> 04:43:58.860 align:start position:0%
and actually something I
 
04:44:01.310 --> 04:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
didn't mention in my which maybe I
 
04:44:02.090 --> 04:44:02.100 align:start position:0%
should have worked in my written
 
04:44:03.530 --> 04:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
testimonial though it's pretty long
 
04:44:05.628 --> 04:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
already is that those rights of
 
04:44:07.368 --> 04:44:07.378 align:start position:0%
responsibilities also have the roots in
 
04:44:10.490 --> 04:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
English common law so and it's similar
 
04:44:11.570 --> 04:44:11.580 align:start position:0%
to other
 
04:44:14.030 --> 04:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
other parliaments in in other countries
 
04:44:16.010 --> 04:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
but especially in English common law the
 
04:44:17.390 --> 04:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
parliament uh
 
04:44:20.208 --> 04:44:20.218 align:start position:0%
governs itself it sets its own rules
 
04:44:20.218 --> 04:44:20.810 align:start position:0%
governs itself it sets its own rules
um

04:44:20.810 --> 04:44:20.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:23.030 --> 04:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
and it has the right you know you can't
 
04:44:25.010 --> 04:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
be punished merely for voting the wrong
 
04:44:27.230 --> 04:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
way when a measure comes to the floor
 
04:44:29.090 --> 04:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
for example just like us we're free to
 
04:44:30.410 --> 04:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
press either the
 
04:44:32.750 --> 04:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
red or green buttoned
 
04:44:34.190 --> 04:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
um it's not a crime to press the wrong
 
04:44:36.350 --> 04:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
button although I do see Revenant shirt
 
04:44:37.490 --> 04:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
lift here and I was one of the shirt
 
04:44:42.590 --> 04:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
with 189 so some people decided 189 of
 
04:44:44.448 --> 04:44:44.458 align:start position:0%
us Revenue shared living Andre together
 
04:44:46.610 --> 04:44:46.620 align:start position:0%
voted the wrong way on a bill and we
 
04:44:48.650 --> 04:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
were accused of crying but could you
 
04:44:50.510 --> 04:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
speaker please speak to the measure well
 
04:44:53.150 --> 04:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
I was speaking the measure Okay so
 
04:44:55.730 --> 04:44:55.740 align:start position:0%
yeah the uh so if a when there's a
 
04:44:58.250 --> 04:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
convention it's going to be a
 
04:45:00.170 --> 04:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
it's going to be operate much the same
 
04:45:02.750 --> 04:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
way the Congress already does only and
 
04:45:05.330 --> 04:45:05.340 align:start position:0%
uh there's anyway to get back to the
 
04:45:06.948 --> 04:45:06.958 align:start position:0%
three specified topics two of them are
 
04:45:08.330 --> 04:45:08.340 align:start position:0%
so vague it's going to guarantee a
 
04:45:10.368 --> 04:45:10.378 align:start position:0%
runaway convention and I don't really
 
04:45:11.810 --> 04:45:11.820 align:start position:0%
know why
 
04:45:13.368 --> 04:45:13.378 align:start position:0%
this is not going to be a popular state
 
04:45:14.690 --> 04:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
in this room but I don't really know why
 
04:45:16.250 --> 04:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
it's under necessary the federal
 
04:45:17.810 --> 04:45:17.820 align:start position:0%
government is already under fiscal
 
04:45:19.550 --> 04:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
constraints I mean so far as that term
 
04:45:21.890 --> 04:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
is any meeting at all then the power and
 
04:45:22.970 --> 04:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction the federal government
 
04:45:25.310 --> 04:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
already is limited I mean maybe it
 
04:45:26.868 --> 04:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
should be more limited I don't
 
04:45:28.010 --> 04:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
necessarily like everything the federal
 
04:45:31.190 --> 04:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
government does but it's it's limited
 
04:45:33.530 --> 04:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
the third item it's a valid topic for
 
04:45:35.030 --> 04:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention I'll actually
 
04:45:37.128 --> 04:45:37.138 align:start position:0%
admit that but
 
04:45:39.170 --> 04:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
I personally oppose it and I think the
 
04:45:41.090 --> 04:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
majority of the American people reject
 
04:45:43.190 --> 04:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
that idea every election cycle when the
 
04:45:45.230 --> 04:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
Democratic re-elect Congress persons and
 
04:45:46.670 --> 04:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
Senators you've been serving for a long
 
04:45:47.990 --> 04:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
time more than whatever
 
04:45:50.150 --> 04:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
12 years is kind of the standard for
 
04:45:51.350 --> 04:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
these term limited amendments but
 
04:45:51.360 --> 04:45:52.128 align:start position:0%
these term limited amendments but
there's

04:45:52.128 --> 04:45:52.138 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:45:53.930 --> 04:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
members of Congress have been reelected
 
04:45:55.490 --> 04:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
and serving for many many years and
 
04:45:57.530 --> 04:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
they're not any better or worse than the
 
04:46:00.170 --> 04:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
ones that have been serving a short time
 
04:46:03.050 --> 04:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
and uh also by the same token long time
 
04:46:04.670 --> 04:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
members can do often lose their
 
04:46:06.890 --> 04:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
re-election bids I mean it happens less
 
04:46:08.270 --> 04:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
often in Congress to the chair of
 
04:46:09.948 --> 04:46:09.958 align:start position:0%
Mandarin than it does here we had a
 
04:46:11.990 --> 04:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
number of members were lost their
 
04:46:13.550 --> 04:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
re-election bids for example here in
 
04:46:15.470 --> 04:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
Congo here in New Hampshire
 
04:46:17.208 --> 04:46:17.218 align:start position:0%
in fact I came within four boats and
 
04:46:18.830 --> 04:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
losing my primary but that's a subject
 
04:46:20.690 --> 04:46:20.700 align:start position:0%
for a whole nother committee
 
04:46:22.610 --> 04:46:22.620 align:start position:0%
finally I disagree and this can be even
 
04:46:24.230 --> 04:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
more popular with the basic rationale
 
04:46:25.550 --> 04:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
for convention
 
04:46:27.110 --> 04:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
our federal government's far from
 
04:46:29.390 --> 04:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
perfect in fact I'd say it's a
 
04:46:31.368 --> 04:46:31.378 align:start position:0%
I'd say it's not that great at all but
 
04:46:33.110 --> 04:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
it's not totally out of control it's not
 
04:46:35.150 --> 04:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
out of control it's it's operating maybe
 
04:46:36.708 --> 04:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
just barely if it's operating from the
 
04:46:39.288 --> 04:46:39.298 align:start position:0%
bounds the United States Constitution
 
04:46:40.910 --> 04:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
and it is pretty much
 
04:46:43.270 --> 04:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
doing what uh
 
04:46:45.708 --> 04:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
the Congress is pretty much doing what
 
04:46:47.270 --> 04:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
they think the people want them to do
 
04:46:48.948 --> 04:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
they may be wrong in lots of cases and
 
04:46:50.448 --> 04:46:50.458 align:start position:0%
I've spent lots of 15 years life in
 
04:46:51.708 --> 04:46:51.718 align:start position:0%
state government I love all three
 
04:46:53.930 --> 04:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
branches of my state government but
 
04:46:56.030 --> 04:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
the federal government is in most cases
 
04:46:58.070 --> 04:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
more Progressive more responsive less
 
04:47:00.170 --> 04:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
oppressive than state governments New
 
04:47:01.910 --> 04:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're a small state with
 
04:47:04.070 --> 04:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
regressive tax system and our state
 
04:47:05.510 --> 04:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
budget is going to be totally dependent
 
04:47:07.070 --> 04:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
on federal dollars as we're going to
 
04:47:09.590 --> 04:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
find out the hard way uh on Valentine's
 
04:47:12.050 --> 04:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
Day when we get to do budget so
 
04:47:15.590 --> 04:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
and uh and although we deal with this uh
 
04:47:17.448 --> 04:47:17.458 align:start position:0%
we do have this rather wonderful and
 
04:47:19.250 --> 04:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
wacky State Legislature that's different
 
04:47:20.690 --> 04:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
those a lot of other states but even
 
04:47:22.128 --> 04:47:22.138 align:start position:0%
here a lot of the legislation we
 
04:47:23.810 --> 04:47:23.820 align:start position:0%
consider is much more restrictive than
 
04:47:25.070 --> 04:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
anything that the Congress is
 
04:47:28.190 --> 04:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
considering as for the federal debt
 
04:47:30.708 --> 04:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
I agree 31.5 trillion it's a lot of
 
04:47:32.330 --> 04:47:32.340 align:start position:0%
money and it's going up it sounds
 
04:47:32.340 --> 04:47:33.650 align:start position:0%
money and it's going up it sounds
crushing

04:47:33.650 --> 04:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
crushing
 
04:47:36.830 --> 04:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
but actually our population is 330
 
04:47:39.410 --> 04:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
million and that does indeed divide out
 
04:47:41.090 --> 04:47:41.100 align:start position:0%
to a hundred thousand dollars per person
 
04:47:41.100 --> 04:47:42.530 align:start position:0%
to a hundred thousand dollars per person
which

04:47:42.530 --> 04:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:47:44.930 --> 04:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
that's a that's pretty scary although
 
04:47:45.948 --> 04:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
actually I think our country probably
 
04:47:47.570 --> 04:47:47.580 align:start position:0%
does have more than a hundred thousand
 
04:47:49.250 --> 04:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
dollars per person worth of debt it's
 
04:47:51.050 --> 04:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
not distributed very equally but I'm
 
04:47:52.250 --> 04:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
sure if sake
 
04:47:54.230 --> 04:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
President Putin somehow managed to buy
 
04:47:56.270 --> 04:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
up all her debt we could probably break
 
04:47:58.910 --> 04:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
over piggy bank would the speaker uh I
 
04:48:01.128 --> 04:48:01.138 align:start position:0%
was speaking to yes so the I think the
 
04:48:04.128 --> 04:48:04.138 align:start position:0%
rationale for the debt um it's we don't
 
04:48:05.628 --> 04:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
need extraordinary measure like an
 
04:48:07.550 --> 04:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention to address it and
 
04:48:10.788 --> 04:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
there's another 7.4 oh there's another
 
04:48:12.708 --> 04:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
seven trillion of that 35 which is just
 
04:48:14.628 --> 04:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
money to federal agent when the federal
 
04:48:16.190 --> 04:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
agency owes to another like because
 
04:48:18.410 --> 04:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
they're revenues and their expenditures
 
04:48:21.830 --> 04:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
toys match up just like we have
 
04:48:21.840 --> 04:48:24.650 align:start position:0%
toys match up just like we have
yeah

04:48:24.650 --> 04:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:24.660 --> 04:48:25.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:48:25.670 --> 04:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:26.930 --> 04:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
is that a member of the committee is
 
04:48:29.170 --> 04:48:29.180 align:start position:0%
facing the point of order
 
04:48:37.010 --> 04:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:38.930 --> 04:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
is we need to talk about the bill at
 
04:48:38.940 --> 04:48:39.948 align:start position:0%
is we need to talk about the bill at
hand

04:48:39.948 --> 04:48:39.958 align:start position:0%
hand
 
04:48:42.948 --> 04:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
please well obviously if that finger
 
04:48:44.868 --> 04:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
upset events twice if you could try to
 
04:48:46.610 --> 04:48:46.620 align:start position:0%
be succinct and speak directly to the
 
04:48:48.590 --> 04:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
measure uh representative would you turn
 
04:48:50.690 --> 04:48:50.700 align:start position:0%
that uh well the red light up so we can
 
04:48:52.010 --> 04:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
hear better and yes go ahead and
 
04:48:54.050 --> 04:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
continue please
 
04:48:55.850 --> 04:48:55.860 align:start position:0%
and both the pros to the procedure and
 
04:48:57.890 --> 04:48:57.900 align:start position:0%
then I'm also arguing further that it's
 
04:48:59.390 --> 04:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
not maybe
 
04:49:01.550 --> 04:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
that the it's not this is not
 
04:49:02.868 --> 04:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
necessarily a good solution to the
 
04:49:04.788 --> 04:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
province or setting to what we're facing
 
04:49:07.010 --> 04:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
us so there's a
 
04:49:09.530 --> 04:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
anyway so all that debt so there's like
 
04:49:12.470 --> 04:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
that uh 24 trillion of that is the money
 
04:49:14.810 --> 04:49:14.820 align:start position:0%
supply and you know the FED does
 
04:49:16.310 --> 04:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes lower the money supply but
 
04:49:17.810 --> 04:49:17.820 align:start position:0%
obviously it's impossible to get the
 
04:49:19.670 --> 04:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
money supplied down to zero in fact it's
 
04:49:20.930 --> 04:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
better to have
 
04:49:22.850 --> 04:49:22.860 align:start position:0%
better to have a adequate money supply
 
04:49:25.850 --> 04:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
than an inadequate one so and the rates
 
04:49:28.010 --> 04:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
are pretty low the US government is
 
04:49:29.208 --> 04:49:29.218 align:start position:0%
actually having no trouble and of course
 
04:49:30.590 --> 04:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
that's maybe one of the reasons why the
 
04:49:31.788 --> 04:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
debt keeps Rising they're having no
 
04:49:33.708 --> 04:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
trouble selling those debt instruments
 
04:49:36.890 --> 04:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
the corporate secret you know prefers
 
04:49:39.470 --> 04:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
buying those
 
04:49:42.170 --> 04:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
um thank you what is your point of order
 
04:49:45.350 --> 04:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:45.360 --> 04:49:46.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:49:46.190 --> 04:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:48.470 --> 04:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
we're getting way off topic I think I'm
 
04:49:48.480 --> 04:49:49.250 align:start position:0%
we're getting way off topic I think I'm
again

04:49:49.250 --> 04:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:49:51.830 --> 04:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
I believe I'm on topic and actually uh
 
04:49:54.170 --> 04:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
all right at this time you don't need to
 
04:49:55.730 --> 04:49:55.740 align:start position:0%
move along does anyone in the committee
 
04:49:57.050 --> 04:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
have any questions for the speaker
 
04:50:00.250 --> 04:50:00.260 align:start position:0%
anyway I urge you to vote no on this um
 
04:50:02.628 --> 04:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
uh I apprecially knowing this resolution
 
04:50:02.638 --> 04:50:05.570 align:start position:0%
uh I apprecially knowing this resolution
and

04:50:05.570 --> 04:50:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:07.490 --> 04:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
actually I got to the end though at one
 
04:50:08.750 --> 04:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
point I pointed out the USA is that
 
04:50:10.128 --> 04:50:10.138 align:start position:0%
we're actually a net creditor the rest
 
04:50:11.930 --> 04:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
of the world like 14 trillion you know I
 
04:50:14.750 --> 04:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
mean the global economy is not great but
 
04:50:17.390 --> 04:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
I don't think this I don't think such
 
04:50:19.128 --> 04:50:19.138 align:start position:0%
historical High convention is going to
 
04:50:20.570 --> 04:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
be helpful at all so thank you I'd be
 
04:50:21.830 --> 04:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions are there
 
04:50:25.190 --> 04:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:27.230 --> 04:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
seeing on thank you for your testimony

representative Claudine Burnham from
 
04:50:53.930 --> 04:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:55.368 --> 04:50:55.378 align:start position:0%
so I recently
 
04:50:57.708 --> 04:50:57.718 align:start position:0%
um there's been a little object lesson I
 
04:51:00.470 --> 04:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
recently completed a homeschool civics
 
04:51:03.590 --> 04:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
class for my high school senior daughter
 
04:51:05.390 --> 04:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
she is um
 
04:51:08.770 --> 04:51:08.780 align:start position:0%
my fourth youngest out of
 
04:51:11.810 --> 04:51:11.820 align:start position:0%
my daughters that I've homeschooled and
 
04:51:15.288 --> 04:51:15.298 align:start position:0%
I've had the privilege to teach them
 
04:51:19.010 --> 04:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
our wonderful Constitution and how our
 
04:51:20.990 --> 04:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
country operates
 
04:51:22.550 --> 04:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
that was a little off cup I'm going to
 
04:51:23.810 --> 04:51:23.820 align:start position:0%
go back to what I'm going to say here
 
04:51:25.550 --> 04:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
because I I might share a little bit
 
04:51:29.570 --> 04:51:29.580 align:start position:0%
something personal at the end so
 
04:51:32.990 --> 04:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
the book this book here is kept simple
 
04:51:35.990 --> 04:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
for this simplified reader and just like
 
04:51:38.150 --> 04:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
this book Article 5 of the United States
 
04:51:40.010 --> 04:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
Constitution simply gives the
 
04:51:42.830 --> 04:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity for not only our elected
 
04:51:45.770 --> 04:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
officials for making amendments to the
 
04:51:48.470 --> 04:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
U.S Constitution but it also gives
 
04:51:51.350 --> 04:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to the people to have a
 
04:51:53.390 --> 04:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
voice should the people decide that
 
04:51:55.970 --> 04:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
their elected representatives Duties are
 
04:51:58.190 --> 04:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
not fulfilled
 
04:52:00.890 --> 04:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
how would American people know if their
 
04:52:02.570 --> 04:52:02.580 align:start position:0%
elected officials
 
04:52:04.250 --> 04:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
were in trouble
 
04:52:06.590 --> 04:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
or if the American government was
 
04:52:06.600 --> 04:52:09.530 align:start position:0%
or if the American government was
hijacked

04:52:09.530 --> 04:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:12.470 --> 04:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
how could the people reign in and out of
 
04:52:14.530 --> 04:52:14.540 align:start position:0%
control spending overreaching
 
04:52:17.150 --> 04:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan career laddering
 
04:52:20.030 --> 04:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
money making government officials
 
04:52:21.948 --> 04:52:21.958 align:start position:0%
how much of what we see in our
 
04:52:24.590 --> 04:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
governments today is what
 
04:52:27.288 --> 04:52:27.298 align:start position:0%
I just mentioned complete abuse from
 
04:52:29.390 --> 04:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
many of our elected officials
 
04:52:33.110 --> 04:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
how can the American people help
 
04:52:35.510 --> 04:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
Article 5 brings back the voice of the
 
04:52:35.520 --> 04:52:36.830 align:start position:0%
Article 5 brings back the voice of the
people

04:52:36.830 --> 04:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:52:39.650 --> 04:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
it is not easy for We the People to make
 
04:52:42.010 --> 04:52:42.020 align:start position:0%
a move to amending the Constitution
 
04:52:45.890 --> 04:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
indeed it takes a lot of unification
 
04:52:49.190 --> 04:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
in an unified Nation
 
04:52:51.470 --> 04:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
the process is arduous
 
04:52:54.170 --> 04:52:54.180 align:start position:0%
the effort is great for the people and
 
04:52:56.930 --> 04:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
then after all that is said and done
 
04:52:59.090 --> 04:52:59.100 align:start position:0%
after all two-thirds of the state's
 
04:53:02.868 --> 04:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
legislatures must be willing
 
04:53:07.190 --> 04:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:11.150 --> 04:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
many who are opposed to hcr1 have
 
04:53:14.030 --> 04:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
nicknamed the convention of States a
 
04:53:16.128 --> 04:53:16.138 align:start position:0%
runaway convention
 
04:53:18.830 --> 04:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
I say we are at a precipice of a runaway
 
04:53:18.840 --> 04:53:20.330 align:start position:0%
I say we are at a precipice of a runaway
government

04:53:20.330 --> 04:53:20.340 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:53:23.208 --> 04:53:23.218 align:start position:0%
ready to be sold to the highest bidder
 
04:53:26.390 --> 04:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
in the world economic forum
 
04:53:29.090 --> 04:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
I support hcr1
 
04:53:30.650 --> 04:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
keep it simple
 
04:53:34.368 --> 04:53:34.378 align:start position:0%
let New Hampshire's people speak
 
04:53:37.250 --> 04:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
and now I share something personal
 
04:53:38.628 --> 04:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
I am
 
04:53:41.030 --> 04:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
first born generation in my family I
 
04:53:43.430 --> 04:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
grew up in a Polish household some of
 
04:53:45.530 --> 04:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
you may know my story
 
04:53:48.050 --> 04:53:48.060 align:start position:0%
my both my grandparents were in Poland
 
04:53:51.470 --> 04:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
when World War II broke out
 
04:53:54.350 --> 04:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
my grandmother at the age of 15
 
04:53:57.050 --> 04:53:57.060 align:start position:0%
one of 15 siblings
 
04:54:00.770 --> 04:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:02.690 --> 04:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
were taken from their home in the middle
 
04:54:05.690 --> 04:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
of the night after second attempts being
 
04:54:07.788 --> 04:54:07.798 align:start position:0%
hiding in their home
 
04:54:12.288 --> 04:54:12.298 align:start position:0%
from the Germans we would think yes
 
04:54:15.050 --> 04:54:15.060 align:start position:0%
wrong that second time when I asked my
 
04:54:17.510 --> 04:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
grandmother who was at the door
 
04:54:20.270 --> 04:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
she said the Polish army with the German
 
04:54:20.280 --> 04:54:23.030 align:start position:0%
she said the Polish army with the German
army

04:54:23.030 --> 04:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:24.890 --> 04:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
they were successful the second time and
 
04:54:27.410 --> 04:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
took her to Warsaw she saw Hitler she
 
04:54:29.570 --> 04:54:29.580 align:start position:0%
saw Stalin she didn't know who they were
 
04:54:31.368 --> 04:54:31.378 align:start position:0%
she was 15 years old
 
04:54:33.830 --> 04:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
I have a 17 year old daughter
 
04:54:36.890 --> 04:54:36.900 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine what she must have
 
04:54:36.900 --> 04:54:37.850 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine what she must have
thought

04:54:37.850 --> 04:54:37.860 align:start position:0%
thought
 
04:54:40.150 --> 04:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
she was lined up in a closed down school
 
04:54:42.890 --> 04:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
like cattle
 
04:54:45.948 --> 04:54:45.958 align:start position:0%
physically being checked out if she was
 
04:54:47.090 --> 04:54:47.100 align:start position:0%
strong enough
 
04:54:50.930 --> 04:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
to handle attack of bread and a small
 
04:54:53.930 --> 04:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
container of water where she traveled a
 
04:54:55.310 --> 04:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
week on a train
 
04:54:58.610 --> 04:54:58.620 align:start position:0%
to a farm and for seven years
 
04:54:58.620 --> 04:54:59.930 align:start position:0%
to a farm and for seven years
she

04:54:59.930 --> 04:54:59.940 align:start position:0%
she
 
04:55:03.590 --> 04:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
was a slave labor milking cows all day
 
04:55:07.850 --> 04:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:11.030 --> 04:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
my grandfather very similar nine years
 
04:55:11.040 --> 04:55:12.350 align:start position:0%
my grandfather very similar nine years
old

04:55:12.350 --> 04:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
old
 
04:55:14.330 --> 04:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
parents weren't able to take care of him
 
04:55:16.490 --> 04:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
father had died
 
04:55:19.970 --> 04:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
he's had to live in a barn in a local
 
04:55:19.980 --> 04:55:21.590 align:start position:0%
he's had to live in a barn in a local
Farm

04:55:21.590 --> 04:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
Farm
 
04:55:23.868 --> 04:55:23.878 align:start position:0%
to shovel manure all day so he can get
 
04:55:25.250 --> 04:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
something to eat by the end of the day
 
04:55:27.948 --> 04:55:27.958 align:start position:0%
and by the time he was 12 he enlisted in
 
04:55:29.990 --> 04:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
the Polish Army that's where his story
 
04:55:31.550 --> 04:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
ends for me
 
04:55:35.330 --> 04:55:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:38.990 --> 04:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
we are down the slippery slope already
 
04:55:41.030 --> 04:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
if we don't speak
 
04:55:42.830 --> 04:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
then who will
 
04:55:45.750 --> 04:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:45.760 --> 04:55:48.350 align:start position:0%

um hcr1
 
04:56:51.948 --> 04:56:51.958 align:start position:0%
I was going to say a lot of things today
 
04:56:55.128 --> 04:56:55.138 align:start position:0%
and I changed my my tune because we had
 
04:56:57.530 --> 04:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
of course you know Michael Farris here
 
04:56:59.868 --> 04:56:59.878 align:start position:0%
which was amazing and he can answer all
 
04:57:01.128 --> 04:57:01.138 align:start position:0%
of these
 
04:57:03.770 --> 04:57:03.780 align:start position:0%
um constitutional questions and really
 
04:57:06.788 --> 04:57:06.798 align:start position:0%
some of it is just um it's a lot of fear
 
04:57:09.770 --> 04:57:09.780 align:start position:0%
and why are we living in this place
 
04:57:11.690 --> 04:57:11.700 align:start position:0%
where we're basing everything on fear
 
04:57:14.270 --> 04:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
and fear controls so
 
04:57:17.750 --> 04:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
Article 5 was made for such a time as
 
04:57:17.760 --> 04:57:18.890 align:start position:0%
Article 5 was made for such a time as
this

04:57:18.890 --> 04:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:57:20.930 --> 04:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
the fathering fathers just didn't give
 
04:57:23.448 --> 04:57:23.458 align:start position:0%
us you know hey just focus on these
 
04:57:26.690 --> 04:57:26.700 align:start position:0%
articles they knew they knew that at
 
04:57:28.670 --> 04:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
some point in time that we would reach
 
04:57:30.770 --> 04:57:30.780 align:start position:0%
where we are today
 
04:57:32.868 --> 04:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
we really no longer have a government
 
04:57:34.190 --> 04:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:57:36.530 --> 04:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
about we the people
 
04:57:38.628 --> 04:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
um there's not really a runaway
 
04:57:39.890 --> 04:57:39.900 align:start position:0%
convention we don't have to worry about
 
04:57:41.690 --> 04:57:41.700 align:start position:0%
that that's been disproven like I said
 
04:57:45.170 --> 04:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
by multiple Scholars we actually have a
 
04:57:46.490 --> 04:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
runaway government
 
04:57:48.730 --> 04:57:48.740 align:start position:0%
so taxation without representation
 
04:57:51.410 --> 04:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
everything that's going on right now
 
04:57:53.628 --> 04:57:53.638 align:start position:0%
trillions of dollars in spending
 
04:57:56.810 --> 04:57:56.820 align:start position:0%
that's not what I voted for
 
04:57:59.150 --> 04:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
you know we are
 
04:58:01.550 --> 04:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
we are about who decides right not what
 
04:58:03.770 --> 04:58:03.780 align:start position:0%
is decided that's what freedom is all
 
04:58:06.410 --> 04:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
about so securing freedom to be
 
04:58:08.390 --> 04:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
self-governing to be able to make
 
04:58:10.970 --> 04:58:10.980 align:start position:0%
decisions that align with what we
 
04:58:10.980 --> 04:58:12.288 align:start position:0%
decisions that align with what we
believe

04:58:12.288 --> 04:58:12.298 align:start position:0%
believe
 
04:58:14.868 --> 04:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
um and what you believe uh without
 
04:58:17.030 --> 04:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
someone trying to mandate or impose
 
04:58:19.490 --> 04:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
beliefs or decisions on you
 
04:58:22.070 --> 04:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's how our founding fathers decided
 
04:58:25.190 --> 04:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
this this is why they had this option
 
04:58:27.650 --> 04:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
Convention of states is really where
 
04:58:29.510 --> 04:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
I've gotten so much of my information I
 
04:58:31.610 --> 04:58:31.620 align:start position:0%
feel very blessed to have wonderful
 
04:58:33.230 --> 04:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
people that have educated me and I'm not
 
04:58:35.448 --> 04:58:35.458 align:start position:0%
a scholar on this at all
 
04:58:38.330 --> 04:58:38.340 align:start position:0%
um but this article five it's truly it's
 
04:58:41.170 --> 04:58:41.180 align:start position:0%
this kind of unifying
 
04:58:44.390 --> 04:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
non-partisan freedom-loving movement for
 
04:58:46.850 --> 04:58:46.860 align:start position:0%
Liberty that is really centrally aligned
 
04:58:49.010 --> 04:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
with what like I said our founding
 
04:58:51.708 --> 04:58:51.718 align:start position:0%
fathers fought so hard to give us
 
04:58:54.650 --> 04:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
Article 5 of The Constitution
 
04:58:56.628 --> 04:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
um was given us so we can ensure that
 
04:58:58.670 --> 04:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
we're able to continue to be the land of
 
04:59:01.310 --> 04:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
the free and the home of the brave
 
04:59:03.530 --> 04:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
and so the only question really left to
 
04:59:06.050 --> 04:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
ask all of you is are you brave enough
 
04:59:08.448 --> 04:59:08.458 align:start position:0%
to help us fight for the freedom to keep
 
04:59:08.458 --> 04:59:09.230 align:start position:0%
to help us fight for the freedom to keep
it

04:59:09.230 --> 04:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:59:10.730 --> 04:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:59:14.930 --> 04:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
thank you representative is there any
 
04:59:16.850 --> 04:59:16.860 align:start position:0%
and it looks like we're not going to be
 
04:59:19.368 --> 04:59:19.378 align:start position:0%
taking questions here at this time are
 
04:59:22.310 --> 04:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
there any other legislators here sitting
 
04:59:24.890 --> 04:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
legislators that we've missed
 
04:59:27.890 --> 04:59:27.900 align:start position:0%
and not seeing any uh I'd like to ask
 
04:59:30.948 --> 04:59:30.958 align:start position:0%

this bill
 
04:59:45.470 --> 04:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to focus on first of all a
 
04:59:47.090 --> 04:59:47.100 align:start position:0%
little background I've been involved in
 
04:59:49.190 --> 04:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
the uh what's I'm calling the amending
 
04:59:52.070 --> 04:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
movement I'm for all of the above
 
04:59:54.830 --> 04:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
and so I'm a background former District
 
04:59:56.448 --> 04:59:56.458 align:start position:0%

uh former chair of the New Hampshire GOP

platform committee so I've dig into
 
05:00:03.480 --> 05:00:04.788 align:start position:0%
platform committee so I've dig into
ideas

05:00:04.788 --> 05:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
ideas
 
05:00:08.750 --> 05:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
I was a GOP Primary candidate for the
 
05:00:12.170 --> 05:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
U.S Senate in 2014 2016 have experienced
 
05:00:15.590 --> 05:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
the election process from various levels
 
05:00:19.190 --> 05:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
I'm a member of the uh of an informal
 
05:00:21.530 --> 05:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
group a Steering group that works
 
05:00:22.730 --> 05:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
together with all the amending
 
05:00:22.740 --> 05:00:23.948 align:start position:0%
together with all the amending
organizations

05:00:23.948 --> 05:00:23.958 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
05:00:26.090 --> 05:00:26.100 align:start position:0%
that is
 
05:00:27.708 --> 05:00:27.718 align:start position:0%
trying to keep in touch with one another
 
05:00:30.470 --> 05:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
trying to mobilize together I'm a board
 
05:00:33.010 --> 05:00:33.020 align:start position:0%
member for American promise
 
05:00:34.670 --> 05:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
americanpromise.net which is the
 
05:00:37.010 --> 05:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
nation's leading group focused on a
 
05:00:39.650 --> 05:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
congressionally drafted amendment to
 
05:00:41.570 --> 05:00:41.580 align:start position:0%
allow Congress and the states to limit
 
05:00:43.070 --> 05:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
campaign money
 
05:00:45.050 --> 05:00:45.060 align:start position:0%
and I'm a volunteer backer of the
 
05:00:47.750 --> 05:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
Wolfpack state-led Article 5 process
 
05:00:51.890 --> 05:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
also focused on seeking limits to uh
 
05:00:54.590 --> 05:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
allowable limits to uh to campaign money
 
05:00:56.628 --> 05:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
so I'm involved in I've been very very
 
05:00:59.628 --> 05:00:59.638 align:start position:0%
involved in this movement at many levels
 
05:01:01.610 --> 05:01:01.620 align:start position:0%
for about 10 years so I'm just going to
 
05:01:04.010 --> 05:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
speak to two things one I'm going to
 
05:01:05.990 --> 05:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
speak to all members of the committee
 
05:01:08.150 --> 05:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
about the runaway process and
 
05:01:10.550 --> 05:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
protections against that the the alleged
 
05:01:10.560 --> 05:01:12.010 align:start position:0%
protections against that the the alleged
asserted

05:01:12.010 --> 05:01:12.020 align:start position:0%
asserted
 
05:01:14.628 --> 05:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
hypothesized or runaway convention to
 
05:01:16.128 --> 05:01:16.138 align:start position:0%
put you at ease on that and secondly I'm
 
05:01:18.708 --> 05:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
going to speak uh just to maybe the
 
05:01:21.530 --> 05:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
Democrats on the committee here uh you
 
05:01:24.050 --> 05:01:24.060 align:start position:0%
know on another topic but and I won't
 
05:01:26.510 --> 05:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
repeat uh protections against Runway
 
05:01:28.190 --> 05:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
except there are basically nine of them
 
05:01:31.128 --> 05:01:31.138 align:start position:0%
nine levels of protection against a
 
05:01:33.410 --> 05:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
runaway convention that would digress
 
05:01:35.750 --> 05:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
from the application that you see here
 
05:01:38.570 --> 05:01:38.580 align:start position:0%
in hcr1 the the document you see is a
 
05:01:41.570 --> 05:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
very very very brief it describes what
 
05:01:43.730 --> 05:01:43.740 align:start position:0%
delegates can do what they can talk
 
05:01:45.288 --> 05:01:45.298 align:start position:0%
about what they can propose at the
 
05:01:47.628 --> 05:01:47.638 align:start position:0%
convention so the hypothesized runaway
 
05:01:51.830 --> 05:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
convention is a process where somehow we
 
05:01:53.750 --> 05:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
get something different than what is
 
05:01:55.670 --> 05:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
described in the bill you see right here
 
05:01:57.948 --> 05:01:57.958 align:start position:0%
in HCR one so protection number one
 
05:01:59.330 --> 05:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
you've probably already heard about this
 
05:02:01.550 --> 05:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
the U.S Department of Justice opinion of
 
05:02:07.070 --> 05:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
1979 which clearly opines that a
 
05:02:09.230 --> 05:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
convention can limit itself to the
 
05:02:11.868 --> 05:02:11.878 align:start position:0%
subjects named as you see here in hcr1
 
05:02:13.850 --> 05:02:13.860 align:start position:0%
that's Protection One
 
05:02:16.368 --> 05:02:16.378 align:start position:0%
protection two is a bit of history there
 
05:02:19.430 --> 05:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
have been 41 multi-state conventions uh
 
05:02:21.788 --> 05:02:21.798 align:start position:0%
to date 11 before
 
05:02:25.368 --> 05:02:25.378 align:start position:0%
1787 and 30 after afterward and not a
 
05:02:27.948 --> 05:02:27.958 align:start position:0%
single one of the Fort 41 multi-state
 
05:02:30.230 --> 05:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
conventions that we've experienced in
 
05:02:31.850 --> 05:02:31.860 align:start position:0%
our United States of America and before
 
05:02:34.010 --> 05:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
we were the United States has ever
 
05:02:36.830 --> 05:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
digressed from the subject matter
 
05:02:38.930 --> 05:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
limitations in the application so
 
05:02:41.810 --> 05:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
there's a very very strong history of
 
05:02:43.910 --> 05:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
conventions multi-state conventions
 
05:02:47.930 --> 05:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
sticking to the task assigned to them
 
05:02:47.940 --> 05:02:49.010 align:start position:0%
sticking to the task assigned to them
um

05:02:49.010 --> 05:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:50.990 --> 05:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
next this is the third level of
 
05:02:51.000 --> 05:02:52.368 align:start position:0%
next this is the third level of
protection

05:02:52.368 --> 05:02:52.378 align:start position:0%
protection
 
05:02:54.288 --> 05:02:54.298 align:start position:0%
Congress is
 
05:02:57.830 --> 05:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
barred constitutionally from calling a
 
05:02:57.840 --> 05:02:59.930 align:start position:0%
barred constitutionally from calling a
convention

05:02:59.930 --> 05:02:59.940 align:start position:0%
convention
 
05:03:04.730 --> 05:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
outside of the limits specified in hcr1
 
05:03:06.770 --> 05:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
how would that borrow happen it would
 
05:03:09.530 --> 05:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly almost instantaneously be
 
05:03:11.090 --> 05:03:11.100 align:start position:0%
litigated where a litigation happy
 
05:03:13.628 --> 05:03:13.638 align:start position:0%
Society so should there be a convention
 
05:03:17.810 --> 05:03:17.820 align:start position:0%
derived from HCR one here and uh and and
 
05:03:20.690 --> 05:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
con and someone assert that the subject
 
05:03:22.310 --> 05:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
matter might include
 
05:03:24.470 --> 05:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh some environmental matter global
 
05:03:26.448 --> 05:03:26.458 align:start position:0%
warming or anything else there would be
 
05:03:28.970 --> 05:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
litigation against that and given the
 
05:03:30.590 --> 05:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
conservative nature of the Supreme Court
 
05:03:32.390 --> 05:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
the litigation would like to Prevail so
 
05:03:34.490 --> 05:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
Congress would be barred from calling
 
05:03:37.670 --> 05:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
the convention so that's uh protection
 
05:03:40.430 --> 05:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
number three protection number four
 
05:03:40.440 --> 05:03:41.570 align:start position:0%
number three protection number four
is

05:03:41.570 --> 05:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:03:44.208 --> 05:03:44.218 align:start position:0%
the the the delegates to the convention
 
05:03:47.868 --> 05:03:47.878 align:start position:0%
under law are acting a principal agent
 
05:03:50.090 --> 05:03:50.100 align:start position:0%
relationship so you folks are the
 
05:03:51.230 --> 05:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
principal you and the New Hampshire
 
05:03:53.030 --> 05:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
legislature here you have a live
 
05:03:56.270 --> 05:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
application now in HCR 40 from 2012
 
05:03:58.550 --> 05:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
relative to budget balancing and debt
 
05:03:58.560 --> 05:03:59.390 align:start position:0%
relative to budget balancing and debt
limit

05:03:59.390 --> 05:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
limit
 
05:04:01.368 --> 05:04:01.378 align:start position:0%
so should you appoint delegates
 
05:04:03.850 --> 05:04:03.860 align:start position:0%
associated with HCR 40
 
05:04:06.830 --> 05:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
those those delegates are your agents
 
05:04:09.530 --> 05:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
you folks sitting in the room and you
 
05:04:12.708 --> 05:04:12.718 align:start position:0%
have a you have a you have a you have a
 
05:04:15.110 --> 05:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
power over them so should they dig
 
05:04:17.390 --> 05:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
digress from the charge you've given
 
05:04:21.110 --> 05:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
them in HCR one or in this case hdr40
 
05:04:24.110 --> 05:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
they are breaching uh the the the the
 
05:04:26.090 --> 05:04:26.100 align:start position:0%
implied contract from you you already
 
05:04:28.788 --> 05:04:28.798 align:start position:0%
have that power 15 states have gone a
 
05:04:30.830 --> 05:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
bit beyond that then they've passed a
 
05:04:33.830 --> 05:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
delegate limitation law 15 states have
 
05:04:36.170 --> 05:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
done this you folks have heard one last
 
05:04:37.850 --> 05:04:37.860 align:start position:0%
Friday you heard it elegant limitation
 
05:04:40.670 --> 05:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
law that that takes a power you already
 
05:04:43.550 --> 05:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
have that principle agent power you
 
05:04:45.310 --> 05:04:45.320 align:start position:0%
already have controlling the delegates
 
05:04:47.750 --> 05:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
forcing them to stick to the subject
 
05:04:50.390 --> 05:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
matter limitations in your resolution in
 
05:04:52.490 --> 05:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
the application so this would simply
 
05:04:55.070 --> 05:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
this bill would simply speed the process
 
05:04:56.690 --> 05:04:56.700 align:start position:0%
and formalize it so that's protection
 
05:04:59.628 --> 05:04:59.638 align:start position:0%
number four protection number five
 
05:05:02.810 --> 05:05:02.820 align:start position:0%
the um is is is a law you might pass
 
05:05:05.990 --> 05:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
protection number six
 
05:05:09.770 --> 05:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
uh you folks appoint likely you will be
 
05:05:11.390 --> 05:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
the people who will appoint the
 
05:05:13.310 --> 05:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
delegates to the amendment convention
 
05:05:15.410 --> 05:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
and this is where it gets a little
 
05:05:18.470 --> 05:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
emotional I trust you folks to appoint
 
05:05:20.448 --> 05:05:20.458 align:start position:0%
delegates number one that will stick to
 
05:05:22.128 --> 05:05:22.138 align:start position:0%
the task that you've assigned to them
 
05:05:24.830 --> 05:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
you folks will have written and passed
 
05:05:27.948 --> 05:05:27.958 align:start position:0%
the legislation in hcr1 describing the
 
05:05:30.110 --> 05:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
task of the delegates I'm I'm confident
 
05:05:32.330 --> 05:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
you folks will appoint delegates who
 
05:05:34.190 --> 05:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
will stick to that task not only that
 
05:05:36.708 --> 05:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
delegates who will work very hard to
 
05:05:38.288 --> 05:05:38.298 align:start position:0%
find consensus around language
 
05:05:40.730 --> 05:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
reflecting the task the charge you give
 
05:05:42.470 --> 05:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
them I have confidence you and I have
 
05:05:44.628 --> 05:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
far more confidence in you than I do in
 
05:05:46.430 --> 05:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
members of Congress because I can walk
 
05:05:48.650 --> 05:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
up and I can talk with you folks I can't
 
05:05:50.390 --> 05:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
do that in Congress I got to pay now
 
05:05:52.788 --> 05:05:52.798 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the I'm getting a little
 
05:05:56.030 --> 05:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
yeah to get a walk and talk in the U.S
 
05:05:58.010 --> 05:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
Senate is about a five to twenty
 
05:06:00.110 --> 05:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar campaign contributions I
 
05:06:01.368 --> 05:06:01.378 align:start position:0%
don't have to do that to talk with you
 
05:06:03.470 --> 05:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
folks so I trust you folks
 
05:06:07.850 --> 05:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
uh protection number seven
 
05:06:10.730 --> 05:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
should delegates propose an amendment
 
05:06:13.250 --> 05:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
outside the charge you've given them for
 
05:06:15.230 --> 05:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
example here in HCR one
 
05:06:17.810 --> 05:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
Congress would be forbidden by the
 
05:06:20.990 --> 05:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution from sending that proposal
 
05:06:23.150 --> 05:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
that proposed amendment back to the
 
05:06:24.770 --> 05:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
States for potential ratification
 
05:06:27.190 --> 05:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
because it digresses from the charge
 
05:06:29.690 --> 05:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
originally given to the delegates and to
 
05:06:31.368 --> 05:06:31.378 align:start position:0%
the amended convention and again there
 
05:06:32.810 --> 05:06:32.820 align:start position:0%
would be litigation should Congress
 
05:06:35.448 --> 05:06:35.458 align:start position:0%
attempt to set back a uh send back to
 
05:06:37.628 --> 05:06:37.638 align:start position:0%
the States for potential ratification
 
05:06:40.490 --> 05:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
a proposed amendment outside the charge
 
05:06:40.500 --> 05:06:42.590 align:start position:0%
a proposed amendment outside the charge
protection

05:06:42.590 --> 05:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
protection
 
05:06:46.788 --> 05:06:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:49.788 --> 05:06:49.798 align:start position:0%
I'll skip beyond that one and protection
 
05:06:52.250 --> 05:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
number nine which is uh really the
 
05:06:53.930 --> 05:06:53.940 align:start position:0%
strongest one of all and this has been
 
05:06:56.390 --> 05:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned and it can be stated very
 
05:06:57.650 --> 05:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
briefly and this is the one because I've
 
05:06:58.788 --> 05:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
been on the phone for about a month
 
05:07:01.010 --> 05:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
talking with people about this article 5
 
05:07:03.470 --> 05:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
process and I've heard the concerns
 
05:07:05.030 --> 05:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
about it they're almost entirely
 
05:07:06.830 --> 05:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
concerns about the runaway convention
 
05:07:09.170 --> 05:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
this is your strongest protection of all
 
05:07:11.750 --> 05:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
let's say all those other eight veils of
 
05:07:14.750 --> 05:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
protection fail and a rogue Amendment
 
05:07:16.490 --> 05:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
somehow gets back to the States for
 
05:07:19.490 --> 05:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
ratification it requires 38 states to
 
05:07:21.590 --> 05:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
ratify and if you heard it takes only 13
 
05:07:24.610 --> 05:07:24.620 align:start position:0%
of 99 legislative bodies in this country
 
05:07:28.310 --> 05:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
to kill any amendment that is not number
 
05:07:30.948 --> 05:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
one well thought out understandable by
 
05:07:33.288 --> 05:07:33.298 align:start position:0%
the people reflects the will of the
 
05:07:35.930 --> 05:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
people and is is supported broadly
 
05:07:37.970 --> 05:07:37.980 align:start position:0%
across the political Spectrum anything
 
05:07:40.010 --> 05:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
coming out as a convention to propose
 
05:07:43.250 --> 05:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
amendments that does not fulfill those
 
05:07:46.010 --> 05:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
criteria is Dead on Arrival 13
 
05:07:48.530 --> 05:07:48.540 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies out of 99 can kill it
 
05:07:50.990 --> 05:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's the ultimate protection so
 
05:07:52.310 --> 05:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
05:07:54.650 --> 05:07:54.660 align:start position:0%
my testimony to all of you and speaking
 
05:07:58.070 --> 05:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
to just maybe the Democrats on on the
 
05:07:59.448 --> 05:07:59.458 align:start position:0%
committee here and the Democrats in this
 
05:08:01.550 --> 05:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
body here hopefully this will come back
 
05:08:03.470 --> 05:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
to the floor for debate
 
05:08:05.628 --> 05:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
if you read the three-part application
 
05:08:07.430 --> 05:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
here and I'm speaking for myself on this
 
05:08:09.410 --> 05:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
just for myself this is my personal
 
05:08:09.420 --> 05:08:10.730 align:start position:0%
just for myself this is my personal
opinion

05:08:10.730 --> 05:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
05:08:13.610 --> 05:08:13.620 align:start position:0%
if you look at the second feature the
 
05:08:15.288 --> 05:08:15.298 align:start position:0%
second leg of this three-part
 
05:08:18.288 --> 05:08:18.298 align:start position:0%
application limiting the power of the
 
05:08:20.330 --> 05:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
05:08:23.510 --> 05:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
if you look at our campaign money system
 
05:08:25.670 --> 05:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
we have right now and again this is my
 
05:08:26.690 --> 05:08:26.700 align:start position:0%
personal View
 
05:08:29.448 --> 05:08:29.458 align:start position:0%
we have a campaign money system that has
 
05:08:32.150 --> 05:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
become very very federalized due to the
 
05:08:34.490 --> 05:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court's citizens united decision
 
05:08:39.350 --> 05:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
of 2010. that decision stripped from uh
 
05:08:41.330 --> 05:08:41.340 align:start position:0%
you folks here in the state and all the
 
05:08:43.490 --> 05:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
states the power to regulate campaign
 
05:08:45.830 --> 05:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
money except money direct to candidates
 
05:08:48.530 --> 05:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
that power was completely stripped from
 
05:08:50.750 --> 05:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
you by an act of the federal government
 
05:08:53.030 --> 05:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
the federal Supreme Court without a
 
05:08:55.670 --> 05:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
factual basis by the way power stripped
 
05:08:58.430 --> 05:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
from you completely and from Congress
 
05:09:02.330 --> 05:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
so this is a a matter of a federal the
 
05:09:05.150 --> 05:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
federal court removing in 2010 a power
 
05:09:07.670 --> 05:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
from you to stop things like Chinese
 
05:09:10.910 --> 05:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
money coming into elections for members
 
05:09:12.410 --> 05:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
of Congress here in the state and again
 
05:09:14.150 --> 05:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
remember I ran for the U.S Senate in
 
05:09:16.788 --> 05:09:16.798 align:start position:0%
2014 2016. I've experienced some of this
 
05:09:19.128 --> 05:09:19.138 align:start position:0%
stuff it stripped from you the power
 
05:09:21.948 --> 05:09:21.958 align:start position:0%
here in the state to say we want our
 
05:09:24.350 --> 05:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
legislators we want our candidates of
 
05:09:27.410 --> 05:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
whatever party to reflect our viewpoints
 
05:09:30.350 --> 05:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
our unique uh value system our unique
 
05:09:32.570 --> 05:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
issue priorities that reflect here in
 
05:09:33.650 --> 05:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire the money
 
05:09:36.470 --> 05:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
system we have right now imposed upon
 
05:09:38.750 --> 05:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
you here in New Hampshire by the federal
 
05:09:40.390 --> 05:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
government through the Supreme Court
 
05:09:44.208 --> 05:09:44.218 align:start position:0%
strips the power that you have to say we
 
05:09:46.550 --> 05:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
want our candidates to reflect our
 
05:09:48.590 --> 05:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
issues priorities we want our candidates
 
05:09:51.650 --> 05:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
to reflect our values in our state as
 
05:09:53.990 --> 05:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to a Super PAC from California
 
05:09:56.230 --> 05:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
or run by
 
05:09:59.330 --> 05:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
Senator Schumer or senator McConnell
 
05:10:01.070 --> 05:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
this is the way the money system right
 
05:10:03.948 --> 05:10:03.958 align:start position:0%
now highly federalized suppressing local
 
05:10:05.930 --> 05:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
candidates suppressing local viewpoints
 
05:10:09.470 --> 05:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
so here's where this cos uh this this
 
05:10:11.390 --> 05:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
three-part resolution comes in limiting
 
05:10:13.310 --> 05:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
the power of the federal government
 
05:10:15.288 --> 05:10:15.298 align:start position:0%
and I again I'm a volunteer with wolf
 
05:10:18.230 --> 05:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
pack okay wolf pack has three states now
 
05:10:20.270 --> 05:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
with live applications
 
05:10:23.150 --> 05:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
on the way to 34. that's a long way from
 
05:10:26.330 --> 05:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
three this application is at 19 States
 
05:10:30.110 --> 05:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
on its way to 34. this application this
 
05:10:31.670 --> 05:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
is why Democrats ought to get behind
 
05:10:33.110 --> 05:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
there right now it's mostly red states
 
05:10:34.850 --> 05:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
that have adopted this resolution in
 
05:10:37.368 --> 05:10:37.378 align:start position:0%
their states purple States and blue
 
05:10:38.990 --> 05:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
States ought to be doing this because
 
05:10:42.050 --> 05:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
this is in my view this is a direct
 
05:10:45.170 --> 05:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
Pathway to giving States once again the
 
05:10:46.910 --> 05:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
power to take Chinese money out of your
 
05:10:49.128 --> 05:10:49.138 align:start position:0%
elections to take Super PAC money from
 
05:10:50.868 --> 05:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
California or wherever else you don't
 
05:10:53.390 --> 05:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
like out of your elections so that we in
 
05:10:55.310 --> 05:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can control
 
05:10:57.350 --> 05:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
our selection of members of Congress
 
05:10:58.490 --> 05:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
once again
 
05:11:02.030 --> 05:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
so and I believe that that any such a
 
05:11:05.390 --> 05:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
delegate proposing language restoring to
 
05:11:07.310 --> 05:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
States this power
 
05:11:10.730 --> 05:11:10.740 align:start position:0%
uh would be Jermaine uh to this uh this
 
05:11:14.150 --> 05:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
language in in this HCR one and so I'll
 
05:11:16.490 --> 05:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
stop there and uh happy to answer any
 
05:11:18.110 --> 05:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
questions and thank you members of the
 
05:11:19.610 --> 05:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
committee for your time I hope this
 
05:11:21.350 --> 05:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
comes out of your committee with a
 
05:11:23.750 --> 05:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
unanimous unanimous recommendation of
 
05:11:25.670 --> 05:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
ought to pass unanimous
 
05:11:27.770 --> 05:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
well thank you Senator I representative
 
05:11:27.780 --> 05:11:37.190 align:start position:0%
well thank you Senator I representative
Kerry

05:11:37.190 --> 05:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:39.530 --> 05:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
missing number eight so what is number
 
05:11:40.970 --> 05:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
eight please
 
05:11:42.770 --> 05:11:42.780 align:start position:0%
well they're they're on this uh did you
 
05:11:44.868 --> 05:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
get the uh this image you could just for
 
05:11:46.850 --> 05:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
the record be easier than me digging out
 
05:11:49.128 --> 05:11:49.138 align:start position:0%
paper oh okay yes yeah I put my glasses
 
05:11:52.610 --> 05:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:56.570 --> 05:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:58.970 --> 05:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
this is number eight is the uh this is
 
05:12:01.368 --> 05:12:01.378 align:start position:0%
Congress being constitutionally barred
 
05:12:03.530 --> 05:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
from submitting back to the States and I
 
05:12:05.230 --> 05:12:05.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned this briefly
 
05:12:07.730 --> 05:12:07.740 align:start position:0%
Congress being constitutionally barred
 
05:12:09.708 --> 05:12:09.718 align:start position:0%
from submitting back to the States again
 
05:12:12.350 --> 05:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
for potential ratification a proposed
 
05:12:14.270 --> 05:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
amendment that came that may come out of
 
05:12:16.610 --> 05:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
the convention but that does not adhere
 
05:12:18.830 --> 05:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
to the subject matter limitations in
 
05:12:20.750 --> 05:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
this case in hcr1
 
05:12:22.550 --> 05:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
so there would be litigation about that
 
05:12:24.890 --> 05:12:24.900 align:start position:0%
I'm confident that this whole process
 
05:12:27.470 --> 05:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
will be process would be monitored in
 
05:12:31.250 --> 05:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
real time by legal legalize across the
 
05:12:34.430 --> 05:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
country and that such filings for uh for
 
05:12:37.010 --> 05:12:37.020 align:start position:0%
runaway uh proposed amendments would be
 
05:12:41.690 --> 05:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
objected to by litigation very promptly
 
05:12:45.530 --> 05:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
yeah other questions for Senator Rubens
 
05:12:49.190 --> 05:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
Senator Senator representative Massimo
 
05:12:51.230 --> 05:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:12:53.090 --> 05:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
taking my question most welcome
 
05:12:55.610 --> 05:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
um do you believe as as many people do
 
05:12:55.620 --> 05:12:57.530 align:start position:0%
um do you believe as as many people do
that

05:12:57.530 --> 05:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:12:57.540 --> 05:12:58.368 align:start position:0%
that
um

05:12:58.368 --> 05:12:58.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:00.708 --> 05:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
if there was the chance like say we got
 
05:13:04.010 --> 05:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
to the 33 State application that
 
05:13:06.948 --> 05:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
Congress might then be forced to take up
 
05:13:09.230 --> 05:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
the subject that the convention was
 
05:13:11.270 --> 05:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
going to originally take up absolutely
 
05:13:13.368 --> 05:13:13.378 align:start position:0%
about about thank you I didn't get to
 
05:13:15.410 --> 05:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
that my written testimony covers this
 
05:13:18.350 --> 05:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
but about half of the 27 present
 
05:13:20.230 --> 05:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
amendments to the U.S Constitution
 
05:13:23.150 --> 05:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
probably happen because of this article
 
05:13:27.410 --> 05:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
5 state-led process the Congress feels
 
05:13:29.448 --> 05:13:29.458 align:start position:0%
the heat sees the light that we we
 
05:13:31.070 --> 05:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
already heard about the Bill of Rights
 
05:13:32.930 --> 05:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
having originated as a result of
 
05:13:35.090 --> 05:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
pressure from the states the 17th
 
05:13:37.010 --> 05:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
Amendment related to direct election of
 
05:13:40.368 --> 05:13:40.378 align:start position:0%
U.S senators so so this process here and
 
05:13:42.050 --> 05:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
again this this applies to all members
 
05:13:44.510 --> 05:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
of this committee if you have some
 
05:13:46.430 --> 05:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
degree of lack of confidence in this
 
05:13:46.440 --> 05:13:47.628 align:start position:0%
degree of lack of confidence in this
process

05:13:47.628 --> 05:13:47.638 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:13:50.150 --> 05:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
this process has been successful in
 
05:13:52.368 --> 05:13:52.378 align:start position:0%
getting Congress to get up off its stuff
 
05:13:54.530 --> 05:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
and deal with the issues again the
 
05:13:57.830 --> 05:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
issues being covered here are broadly
 
05:13:59.810 --> 05:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
broadly supported by the American public
 
05:14:03.590 --> 05:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
Congress thus far will not act
 
05:14:06.170 --> 05:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
any any extent to which we increase the
 
05:14:08.390 --> 05:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
number of states in this case from 19 up
 
05:14:10.730 --> 05:14:10.740 align:start position:0%
toward Thirty thirty four is going to
 
05:14:13.070 --> 05:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
increase pressure on Congress to get its
 
05:14:15.530 --> 05:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
act in gear and and do what uh do what
 
05:14:17.448 --> 05:14:17.458 align:start position:0%
the American people want
 
05:14:19.310 --> 05:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah
 
05:14:22.250 --> 05:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
and the questions for Senator Rubens
 
05:14:23.868 --> 05:14:23.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:14:26.760 --> 05:14:26.770 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thanks senator
 
05:14:26.770 --> 05:14:46.128 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thanks senator
[Applause]

05:14:46.128 --> 05:14:46.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:47.628 --> 05:14:47.638 align:start position:0%
okay a couple things again as I
 
05:14:48.890 --> 05:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
mentioned before we have a tradition
 
05:14:52.930 --> 05:14:52.940 align:start position:0%
here we try to avoid uh signaling or
 
05:14:57.230 --> 05:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
Applause so I do need to uh to pass that
 
05:14:59.390 --> 05:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
on a second time
 
05:15:03.350 --> 05:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh The Honorable Fenton ground is is he
 
05:15:07.010 --> 05:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
here very yes uh another Rochester very
 
05:15:08.990 --> 05:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
well represented today uh welcome back
 
05:15:09.000 --> 05:15:10.010 align:start position:0%
well represented today uh welcome back
uh

05:15:10.010 --> 05:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:15:15.170 --> 05:15:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:17.690 --> 05:15:17.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:15:21.890 --> 05:15:21.900 align:start position:0%
uh I will not go into the details of how
 
05:15:23.570 --> 05:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
this works because you've heard a whole
 
05:15:26.270 --> 05:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
lot about that I do believe it's a very
 
05:15:30.830 --> 05:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
safe process I was the sponsor of a uh
 
05:15:33.770 --> 05:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
Article 5 resolution when I was in the
 
05:15:37.610 --> 05:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
Senate in 2011 it passed in 2012 and I
 
05:15:39.770 --> 05:15:39.780 align:start position:0%
might say it passed 19 to five in the
 
05:15:42.350 --> 05:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
Senate and with I believe a 60 or 61
 
05:15:44.570 --> 05:15:44.580 align:start position:0%
percent majority in the house at that
 
05:15:47.390 --> 05:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
point so I won't go into that what I
 
05:15:50.810 --> 05:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
want to talk about is why is it neat so
 
05:15:52.910 --> 05:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
first of all I believe it's a safe
 
05:15:56.150 --> 05:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
process I believe we should do it
 
05:15:59.150 --> 05:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
I believe that the danger of not doing
 
05:16:01.850 --> 05:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
it is far greater than the danger of a
 
05:16:03.890 --> 05:16:03.900 align:start position:0%
Runway convention so I want to talk
 
05:16:03.900 --> 05:16:04.788 align:start position:0%
Runway convention so I want to talk
about

05:16:04.788 --> 05:16:04.798 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:16:07.430 --> 05:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
what the purpose of this is so the first
 
05:16:10.310 --> 05:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
purpose that's limited here is to impose
 
05:16:11.868 --> 05:16:11.878 align:start position:0%
fiscal restraints on the federal
 
05:16:11.878 --> 05:16:13.070 align:start position:0%
fiscal restraints on the federal
government

05:16:13.070 --> 05:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:16:17.150 --> 05:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
now looking at the committee here I see
 
05:16:19.490 --> 05:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
a few of you that were here in 1980 as I
 
05:16:21.770 --> 05:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
was not here in this room but here on
 
05:16:25.010 --> 05:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
this Earth uh in 1980
 
05:16:27.470 --> 05:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
you wonder what the federal debt was in
 
05:16:27.480 --> 05:16:29.330 align:start position:0%
you wonder what the federal debt was in
1980.

05:16:29.330 --> 05:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
1980.
 
05:16:32.510 --> 05:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
it's 918 billion
 
05:16:37.570 --> 05:16:37.580 align:start position:0%
in 1980. and I thought that was awful
 
05:16:39.910 --> 05:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
918 billion
 
05:16:42.890 --> 05:16:42.900 align:start position:0%
in 2003
 
05:16:47.208 --> 05:16:47.218 align:start position:0%
excuse me in in 1998 25 years ago it was
 
05:16:49.310 --> 05:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
3.8 trillion
 
05:16:52.550 --> 05:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
in 2003 five years later it was 6.8
 
05:16:56.470 --> 05:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
trillion in 2012 when we passed the
 
05:16:59.090 --> 05:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
resolution in the Senate and then the
 
05:16:59.100 --> 05:16:59.868 align:start position:0%
resolution in the Senate and then the
house

05:16:59.868 --> 05:16:59.878 align:start position:0%
house
 
05:17:04.010 --> 05:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
it was 16 trillion and today it is 31.5
 
05:17:06.948 --> 05:17:06.958 align:start position:0%
trillion so just to put this in
 
05:17:08.448 --> 05:17:08.458 align:start position:0%
perspective I won't give percentages
 
05:17:11.090 --> 05:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
because they're too big to give that is
 
05:17:11.100 --> 05:17:12.010 align:start position:0%
because they're too big to give that is
a

05:17:12.010 --> 05:17:12.020 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:17:15.530 --> 05:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
34.3 Time increase
 
05:17:19.430 --> 05:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
since 1980 in our federal debt it is an
 
05:17:19.440 --> 05:17:21.128 align:start position:0%
since 1980 in our federal debt it is an
8.3

05:17:21.128 --> 05:17:21.138 align:start position:0%
8.3
 
05:17:25.690 --> 05:17:25.700 align:start position:0%
multiplier increase since 1998
 
05:17:28.990 --> 05:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
4.6 cents
 
05:17:32.930 --> 05:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
2003 doubled since 2012.
 
05:17:34.910 --> 05:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
now let's talk a little bit about the
 
05:17:34.920 --> 05:17:35.930 align:start position:0%
now let's talk a little bit about the
debt

05:17:35.930 --> 05:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
debt
 
05:17:38.750 --> 05:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
for years as you know we had Rock Bottom
 
05:17:40.128 --> 05:17:40.138 align:start position:0%
interest rates
 
05:17:42.170 --> 05:17:42.180 align:start position:0%
the federal debt was being serviced at
 
05:17:43.970 --> 05:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
under two percent
 
05:17:43.980 --> 05:17:45.350 align:start position:0%
under two percent
today

05:17:45.350 --> 05:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:17:47.270 --> 05:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
Treasurer bonds are being sold for over
 
05:17:49.190 --> 05:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
four percent
 
05:17:52.128 --> 05:17:52.138 align:start position:0%
you take that two percent difference in
 
05:17:52.138 --> 05:17:53.208 align:start position:0%
you take that two percent difference in
interest

05:17:53.208 --> 05:17:53.218 align:start position:0%
interest
 
05:17:58.430 --> 05:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
it's 630 billion dollars a year Point
 
05:18:02.208 --> 05:18:02.218 align:start position:0%
Six Trillion a year increase in service
 
05:18:04.610 --> 05:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
of the federal debt that's without the
 
05:18:07.070 --> 05:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
federal debt growing
 
05:18:08.750 --> 05:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
what's that going to do to inflation
 
05:18:10.368 --> 05:18:10.378 align:start position:0%
going on what's that going to do to
 
05:18:11.810 --> 05:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
budget going on
 
05:18:14.390 --> 05:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
now what brings this about
 
05:18:14.400 --> 05:18:15.708 align:start position:0%
now what brings this about
so

05:18:15.708 --> 05:18:15.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:18:19.010 --> 05:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
that comes to the second part of it the
 
05:18:21.770 --> 05:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
reining in the power of the federal
 
05:18:21.780 --> 05:18:23.448 align:start position:0%
reining in the power of the federal
government

05:18:23.448 --> 05:18:23.458 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:18:26.570 --> 05:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
I'm contractor general contractor for 18
 
05:18:28.788 --> 05:18:28.798 align:start position:0%
years we Built Homes and some commercial
 
05:18:30.650 --> 05:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
today were strictly a Commercial
 
05:18:30.660 --> 05:18:32.030 align:start position:0%
today were strictly a Commercial
contractor

05:18:32.030 --> 05:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
05:18:34.010 --> 05:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
I've been a member for many years in the
 
05:18:36.050 --> 05:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
National Association of Home Builders
 
05:18:38.628 --> 05:18:38.638 align:start position:0%
their statistics I saw in December they
 
05:18:40.850 --> 05:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
came out and they said that today for
 
05:18:42.890 --> 05:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
the price of a new home and we all know
 
05:18:45.110 --> 05:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
we want to have affordable housing for
 
05:18:48.110 --> 05:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
the price of a new home 41.5 percent of
 
05:18:49.490 --> 05:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
the cost of a new home is due to
 
05:18:49.500 --> 05:18:51.050 align:start position:0%
the cost of a new home is due to
regulations

05:18:51.050 --> 05:18:51.060 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
05:18:54.110 --> 05:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
okay now we know some of those are
 
05:18:56.690 --> 05:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
needed and I won't argue that but some
 
05:18:59.208 --> 05:18:59.218 align:start position:0%
of them are way overboard
 
05:19:02.810 --> 05:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
the bigger problem with it is that most
 
05:19:05.330 --> 05:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
many if not most of those regulations
 
05:19:08.990 --> 05:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
are not created by the federal
 
05:19:11.470 --> 05:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
government or even by the state they're
 
05:19:14.270 --> 05:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
created by
 
05:19:17.628 --> 05:19:17.638 align:start position:0%
either private or federal or state
 
05:19:17.638 --> 05:19:19.368 align:start position:0%
either private or federal or state
bureaucracies

05:19:19.368 --> 05:19:19.378 align:start position:0%
bureaucracies
 
05:19:22.128 --> 05:19:22.138 align:start position:0%
yes I know there's an approval process
 
05:19:24.770 --> 05:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
but the approval process generally does
 
05:19:26.868 --> 05:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
not deal with the specifics as is when
 
05:19:29.030 --> 05:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
we approve a new building code here in
 
05:19:30.410 --> 05:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:19:33.288 --> 05:19:33.298 align:start position:0%
so we need and especially in the federal
 
05:19:35.150 --> 05:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
government level we need that brought
 
05:19:39.470 --> 05:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
back more to the power of limiting that
 
05:19:42.350 --> 05:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
power of anybody but the legislature
 
05:19:47.030 --> 05:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
making that uh making those regulations
 
05:19:49.788 --> 05:19:49.798 align:start position:0%
I'm very familiar with something that
 
05:19:53.390 --> 05:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
that's called waldus w-o-t-u-s
 
05:19:56.288 --> 05:19:56.298 align:start position:0%
and if you're not in construction or
 
05:19:58.730 --> 05:19:58.740 align:start position:0%
issues regarding land use or probably
 
05:20:00.050 --> 05:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
not familiar with that that's called
 
05:20:02.448 --> 05:20:02.458 align:start position:0%
Waters of the United States
 
05:20:04.730 --> 05:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
the Waters of the United States when the
 
05:20:06.590 --> 05:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
bill was passed I believe it was in the
 
05:20:06.600 --> 05:20:07.610 align:start position:0%
bill was passed I believe it was in the
70s

05:20:07.610 --> 05:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
70s
 
05:20:10.368 --> 05:20:10.378 align:start position:0%
was navigable Waters
 
05:20:13.190 --> 05:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
and defined as something you can run a
 
05:20:15.708 --> 05:20:15.718 align:start position:0%
vote on initially that was
 
05:20:17.868 --> 05:20:17.878 align:start position:0%
Rivers such as the Mississippi and
 
05:20:19.670 --> 05:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
Missouri that were navigable for
 
05:20:19.680 --> 05:20:21.350 align:start position:0%
Missouri that were navigable for
Commerce

05:20:21.350 --> 05:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
Commerce
 
05:20:23.030 --> 05:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
eventually it was added that it was
 
05:20:28.368 --> 05:20:28.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:31.150 --> 05:20:31.160 align:start position:0%
in I believe it was
 
05:20:34.868 --> 05:20:34.878 align:start position:0%
2014 or 15.
 
05:20:37.910 --> 05:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
a an executive order came out and then
 
05:20:40.670 --> 05:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
was followed up by rules that expanded
 
05:20:42.708 --> 05:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
waldus the Waters of the United States
 
05:20:46.670 --> 05:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
to be anything that fed a navigable
 
05:20:46.680 --> 05:20:48.230 align:start position:0%
to be anything that fed a navigable
water

05:20:48.230 --> 05:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
water
 
05:20:52.190 --> 05:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
and as a result a man-made ditch that
 
05:20:53.930 --> 05:20:53.940 align:start position:0%
was created
 
05:20:55.550 --> 05:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
by a farmer
 
05:20:57.288 --> 05:20:57.298 align:start position:0%
and had water run through it
 
05:20:59.270 --> 05:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
periodically and might have some Wetland
 
05:21:02.270 --> 05:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
grasses and stuff in it became Waters of
 
05:21:03.770 --> 05:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
the United States
 
05:21:08.030 --> 05:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
and became subject to that regulation
 
05:21:12.830 --> 05:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
it added trillions trillions of dollars
 
05:21:15.530 --> 05:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
to development costs
 
05:21:17.930 --> 05:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
much of that stays in place today that
 
05:21:20.150 --> 05:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
was not approved by Congress that was
 
05:21:22.010 --> 05:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
not put in by Congress we need an
 
05:21:25.010 --> 05:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
ability to Reign this in we need an
 
05:21:27.948 --> 05:21:27.958 align:start position:0%
ability for Congress to challenge such
 
05:21:30.230 --> 05:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
rules and be more effective in it that
 
05:21:33.170 --> 05:21:33.180 align:start position:0%
would be that could be part of this type
 
05:21:35.690 --> 05:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
of a process we know what's happened
 
05:21:38.390 --> 05:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
with executive orders under both
 
05:21:40.970 --> 05:21:40.980 align:start position:0%
Democrats and Republicans executive
 
05:21:43.550 --> 05:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
orders have taken on the the level of
 
05:21:45.530 --> 05:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
Law and their I don't believe they're
 
05:21:47.390 --> 05:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
being challenged properly by the courts
 
05:21:48.708 --> 05:21:48.718 align:start position:0%
over Congress
 
05:21:53.090 --> 05:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
do we need this we need it desperately
 
05:21:55.010 --> 05:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
and we need it now
 
05:21:56.208 --> 05:21:56.218 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:21:57.590 --> 05:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
and I'll be happy to answer any
 
05:21:59.750 --> 05:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
questions and the questions for former
 
05:22:03.770 --> 05:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:06.288 --> 05:22:06.298 align:start position:0%
on thank you for coming here from from
 
05:22:06.298 --> 05:22:11.990 align:start position:0%
on thank you for coming here from from
Rochester

05:22:11.990 --> 05:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:14.628 --> 05:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
okay the honor The Honorable Kurt welper
 
05:22:15.890 --> 05:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
I saw
 
05:22:20.330 --> 05:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
in the house earlier is is he still here
 
05:22:34.310 --> 05:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:36.350 --> 05:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
05:22:39.230 --> 05:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
committee uh obviously
 
05:22:41.510 --> 05:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
I support this for two reasons three
 
05:22:41.520 --> 05:22:44.270 align:start position:0%
I support this for two reasons three
reasons

05:22:44.270 --> 05:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:47.208 --> 05:22:47.218 align:start position:0%
one reason is I think this is something
 
05:22:49.430 --> 05:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
that we absolutely need
 
05:22:52.788 --> 05:22:52.798 align:start position:0%
to help unify our country
 
05:22:55.190 --> 05:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
the political process we have and the
 
05:22:57.230 --> 05:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
operation in Washington
 
05:22:59.150 --> 05:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
has put us in a place where we haven't
 
05:23:01.788 --> 05:23:01.798 align:start position:0%
had a budget in years it seems like they
 
05:23:04.550 --> 05:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
can't pass a bill to
 
05:23:06.288 --> 05:23:06.298 align:start position:0%
recognize the colors of the United
 
05:23:08.510 --> 05:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
States flag
 
05:23:10.730 --> 05:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
and will help us
 
05:23:12.350 --> 05:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
you've heard a lot about the debt and
 
05:23:14.208 --> 05:23:14.218 align:start position:0%
all that that's absolutely true I 100
 
05:23:14.218 --> 05:23:16.070 align:start position:0%
all that that's absolutely true I 100
concur

05:23:16.070 --> 05:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
concur
 
05:23:18.110 --> 05:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
it needs to get fixed but it isn't
 
05:23:19.910 --> 05:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
getting fixed we're going to be putting
 
05:23:21.770 --> 05:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
a couple million on here whatever next
 
05:23:24.350 --> 05:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
week next month trillion I meant
 
05:23:26.570 --> 05:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
it's ridiculous
 
05:23:29.090 --> 05:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
so we have to fix it
 
05:23:32.810 --> 05:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
and the founders gave us away
 
05:23:35.510 --> 05:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
this is the way
 
05:23:38.448 --> 05:23:38.458 align:start position:0%
the lawsuit that's out there
 
05:23:40.430 --> 05:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
that we want the Attorney General to be
 
05:23:42.170 --> 05:23:42.180 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor
 
05:23:46.150 --> 05:23:46.160 align:start position:0%
is a necessary step in that because
 
05:23:50.330 --> 05:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
Congress is failing to do its job
 
05:23:52.010 --> 05:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
05:23:52.020 --> 05:23:54.250 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
tally

05:23:54.250 --> 05:23:54.260 align:start position:0%
tally
 
05:23:54.260 --> 05:23:56.150 align:start position:0%
tally
requests

05:23:56.150 --> 05:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
requests
 
05:24:00.530 --> 05:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't thereby know or recognize
 
05:24:03.830 --> 05:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
when a valid Article 5 request has been
 
05:24:03.840 --> 05:24:04.788 align:start position:0%
when a valid Article 5 request has been
made

05:24:04.788 --> 05:24:04.798 align:start position:0%
made
 
05:24:08.628 --> 05:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
and if it does they just must be with
 
05:24:10.250 --> 05:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
those other classifying documents that
 
05:24:14.150 --> 05:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:14.160 --> 05:24:15.530 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:24:15.530 --> 05:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:24:17.270 --> 05:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
I just see this is something we have to
 
05:24:19.190 --> 05:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
do you can't get done any other way in
 
05:24:21.590 --> 05:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
my view and and
 
05:24:24.830 --> 05:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
this has not been an unknown problem for
 
05:24:26.990 --> 05:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
the past 40 or 50 years it's been
 
05:24:30.110 --> 05:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
discussed on a regular basis
 
05:24:32.690 --> 05:24:32.700 align:start position:0%
time to get moving and the way to do it
 
05:24:32.700 --> 05:24:34.670 align:start position:0%
time to get moving and the way to do it
unfortunately

05:24:34.670 --> 05:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
05:24:38.690 --> 05:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
is to force Congress to do its job
 
05:24:40.788 --> 05:24:40.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:24:43.368 --> 05:24:43.378 align:start position:0%
thank you and the questions for The
 
05:24:47.510 --> 05:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:50.448 --> 05:24:50.458 align:start position:0%
not seeing any The Honorable
 
05:24:53.990 --> 05:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
Erica Victoria Eastman is she from
 
05:25:00.550 --> 05:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:04.128 --> 05:25:04.138 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing her
 
05:25:06.350 --> 05:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
okay moving along I I want to make a
 
05:25:08.930 --> 05:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
quick comment or two here I will be here
 
05:25:11.868 --> 05:25:11.878 align:start position:0%
as long as it takes I very much enjoyed
 
05:25:14.150 --> 05:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
being here that's why I wanted to be
 
05:25:14.160 --> 05:25:15.288 align:start position:0%
being here that's why I wanted to be
here

05:25:15.288 --> 05:25:15.298 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:25:17.810 --> 05:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
um I sponsored a Civics bill it's now a

05:25:27.650 --> 05:25:27.660 align:start position:0%
of us will be here uh so as we move
 
05:25:30.110 --> 05:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
along here I still have a good a pretty
 
05:25:32.270 --> 05:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
good stack of pink cards
 
05:25:35.150 --> 05:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
um as we go through these uh I don't
 
05:25:37.750 --> 05:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
want to limit anybody's test testimony
 
05:25:40.970 --> 05:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
if we can avoid that I want to you took
 
05:25:42.890 --> 05:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
the time to travel here and I want to
 
05:25:44.628 --> 05:25:44.638 align:start position:0%
hear and you want to others want to hear
 
05:25:46.670 --> 05:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
what you have to say so we will just
 
05:25:49.850 --> 05:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
simply ask if if the Salient main points
 
05:25:51.050 --> 05:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
that you want to make have already been
 
05:25:52.610 --> 05:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
stated then you don't need to
 
05:25:54.530 --> 05:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
necessarily elaborate on what has been
 
05:25:56.030 --> 05:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
said I would say that and if everybody
 
05:25:58.310 --> 05:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
wants to waive off you certainly can
 
05:26:00.770 --> 05:26:00.780 align:start position:0%
and I finally I will point out that this
 
05:26:03.410 --> 05:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
is streaming live uh it will be on
 
05:26:06.170 --> 05:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
YouTube uh I know Senator Rubens is
 
05:26:07.910 --> 05:26:07.920 align:start position:0%

05:26:09.708 --> 05:26:09.718 align:start position:0%
whoever's watching or gonna watch on
 
05:26:11.330 --> 05:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
YouTube would have wanted to know that
 
05:26:12.470 --> 05:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
eighth point
 
05:26:14.330 --> 05:26:14.340 align:start position:0%

some folks have asked for five minutes
 
05:26:20.810 --> 05:26:20.820 align:start position:0%

if uh if some of the points have been
 
05:26:32.750 --> 05:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
made uh feel free to not repeat them so
 
05:26:37.128 --> 05:26:37.138 align:start position:0%
let's now go to uh L brendano who I've
 
05:26:48.230 --> 05:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:50.570 --> 05:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:26:54.050 --> 05:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
um chairman Moffett and committee my

director for the convention States
 
05:27:01.430 --> 05:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
and may I begin in this beautiful Hall
 
05:27:04.070 --> 05:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
and I always am overwhelmed when I look
 
05:27:06.288 --> 05:27:06.298 align:start position:0%
around me of the people who've come
 
05:27:08.650 --> 05:27:08.660 align:start position:0%
before us and what they've had to
 
05:27:11.810 --> 05:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
do in our in for the benefit of all of
 
05:27:14.448 --> 05:27:14.458 align:start position:0%
us but I want to start with the words of
 
05:27:17.270 --> 05:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
Alexander Hamilton in 1788 federalist
 
05:27:17.280 --> 05:27:18.770 align:start position:0%
Alexander Hamilton in 1788 federalist
51.

05:27:18.770 --> 05:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
51.
 
05:27:21.530 --> 05:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
if men were Angels no government would
 
05:27:22.730 --> 05:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
be necessary
 
05:27:25.788 --> 05:27:25.798 align:start position:0%
if Angels were to govern men neither
 
05:27:28.910 --> 05:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
external or internal controls on
 
05:27:31.190 --> 05:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
government would be necessary
 
05:27:33.530 --> 05:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
in that spirit I rise today in support
 
05:27:35.510 --> 05:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
of hcr1
 
05:27:37.490 --> 05:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
the resolution of the convention of
 
05:27:41.690 --> 05:27:41.700 align:start position:0%
states to Simply propose amendments to
 
05:27:46.850 --> 05:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:51.170 --> 05:27:51.180 align:start position:0%
you may ask me why I ask you why not
 
05:27:55.550 --> 05:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
One Federal term limits why not over 80
 
05:27:57.470 --> 05:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
percent of the U.S population is in
 
05:27:58.910 --> 05:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
support of it
 
05:28:00.830 --> 05:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
it's interesting if you look at Congress
 
05:28:03.770 --> 05:28:03.780 align:start position:0%
and the Senate they have a 19 approval
 
05:28:06.650 --> 05:28:06.660 align:start position:0%
rating yet they're elected 95 percent of
 
05:28:07.670 --> 05:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
the time
 
05:28:09.948 --> 05:28:09.958 align:start position:0%
if you're a lobbyist who would you be
 
05:28:11.570 --> 05:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
investing in
 
05:28:14.510 --> 05:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
number two fiscal responsibility
 
05:28:17.810 --> 05:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
why not it's supported by 70 percent of
 
05:28:20.750 --> 05:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
the U.S voters in fact today when you
 
05:28:22.490 --> 05:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
left your house your house your wife or
 
05:28:24.590 --> 05:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
husband probably asked you before you
 
05:28:27.350 --> 05:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
left if um if you know we were going to
 
05:28:28.850 --> 05:28:28.860 align:start position:0%
make the budget this week or we had to
 
05:28:30.410 --> 05:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
cut back on something
 
05:28:32.448 --> 05:28:32.458 align:start position:0%
well guess what the nonpartisan
 
05:28:34.430 --> 05:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
Congressional budget office just this
 
05:28:35.990 --> 05:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
week agrees with you
 
05:28:39.230 --> 05:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
they told us that social security
 
05:28:42.770 --> 05:28:42.780 align:start position:0%
could go bust as early as 2033
 
05:28:45.650 --> 05:28:45.660 align:start position:0%
and Medicare trust fund insolvency by
 
05:28:45.660 --> 05:28:47.990 align:start position:0%
and Medicare trust fund insolvency by
2027.

05:28:47.990 --> 05:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
2027.
 
05:28:49.550 --> 05:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
number three
 
05:28:53.170 --> 05:28:53.180 align:start position:0%
return to states rights why not
 
05:28:56.030 --> 05:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
1776 Colonel Mason the father of article
 
05:28:59.330 --> 05:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
5. and Visionary of Liberty
 
05:29:02.690 --> 05:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
Guided by the wisdom of federalist 51
 
05:29:05.868 --> 05:29:05.878 align:start position:0%
got unanimous consent of No Greater body
 
05:29:08.930 --> 05:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
of men of wisdom ever assembled in
 
05:29:11.090 --> 05:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
history at the time of the Constitution
 
05:29:13.128 --> 05:29:13.138 align:start position:0%
imagine that
 
05:29:15.590 --> 05:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
at that time 90 percent of the power of
 
05:29:16.730 --> 05:29:16.740 align:start position:0%
the government
 
05:29:20.868 --> 05:29:20.878 align:start position:0%
would be governed by the States today
 
05:29:23.448 --> 05:29:23.458 align:start position:0%
it's nearly reversed ninety percent is
 
05:29:28.190 --> 05:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
federal and 10 percent is the states
 
05:29:30.590 --> 05:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
yet sadly seven years for seven years
 
05:29:33.050 --> 05:29:33.060 align:start position:0%
I've come before your committee
 
05:29:36.890 --> 05:29:36.900 align:start position:0%
and this committee has prevented debate
 
05:29:39.010 --> 05:29:39.020 align:start position:0%
to the full floor of the house
 
05:29:41.810 --> 05:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
and it's been blocked away maybe for
 
05:29:45.050 --> 05:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
politics or uh even shamefully misguided
 
05:29:45.060 --> 05:29:46.550 align:start position:0%
politics or uh even shamefully misguided
fear

05:29:46.550 --> 05:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
fear
 
05:29:49.310 --> 05:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
during this time that we've been unable
 
05:29:51.110 --> 05:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
to address this
 
05:29:53.570 --> 05:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
the federal government has run away to
 
05:29:55.970 --> 05:29:55.980 align:start position:0%
31 trillion dollars
 
05:29:58.010 --> 05:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
I want to I want to indicate and show
 
05:30:00.050 --> 05:30:00.060 align:start position:0%
you what 31 trillion is we talk about it
 
05:30:04.550 --> 05:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
but we don't know it's 18 round trips
 
05:30:07.850 --> 05:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
from the Earth to the Sun and back a
 
05:30:09.770 --> 05:30:09.780 align:start position:0%
dollar laid end to end
 
05:30:11.690 --> 05:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
think about that for a minute that's
 
05:30:13.430 --> 05:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
05:30:15.470 --> 05:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
according to Janet Yellen today the
 
05:30:16.850 --> 05:30:16.860 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve has taken an
 
05:30:20.868 --> 05:30:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:23.090 --> 05:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
and this is what I've taken in my bag
 
05:30:25.430 --> 05:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
for the last seven years
 
05:30:27.170 --> 05:30:27.180 align:start position:0%
these little shoes
 
05:30:29.390 --> 05:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
and they mean something to me because
 
05:30:31.310 --> 05:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
what they mean to me is
 
05:30:33.350 --> 05:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
we're putting our children our
 
05:30:34.810 --> 05:30:34.820 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and our great
 
05:30:37.788 --> 05:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
grandchildren in servitude these little
 
05:30:37.798 --> 05:30:39.110 align:start position:0%
grandchildren in servitude these little
shoes

05:30:39.110 --> 05:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
shoes
 
05:30:41.090 --> 05:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
when we talk about voting on these
 
05:30:43.910 --> 05:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
things we don't think about this this is
 
05:30:45.288 --> 05:30:45.298 align:start position:0%
the future
 
05:30:47.990 --> 05:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
and we're putting them in servitude and
 
05:30:51.708 --> 05:30:51.718 align:start position:0%
we can't do that and we must act
 
05:30:54.410 --> 05:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
for our national security is also a
 
05:30:56.208 --> 05:30:56.218 align:start position:0%
great risk
 
05:30:58.788 --> 05:30:58.798 align:start position:0%

Nathaniel lavecchio and I'm here to
 
05:32:40.430 --> 05:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of the calling a
 
05:32:42.410 --> 05:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
Convention of the states
 
05:32:42.420 --> 05:32:44.030 align:start position:0%
Convention of the states
I'm

05:32:44.030 --> 05:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
05:32:44.040 --> 05:32:46.730 align:start position:0%
I'm
sorry

05:32:46.730 --> 05:32:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:49.750 --> 05:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
I'm asking that you please approve
 
05:32:53.030 --> 05:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
hcr1 the reason being the chaos spending
 
05:32:53.040 --> 05:32:54.230 align:start position:0%
hcr1 the reason being the chaos spending
of

05:32:54.230 --> 05:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:32:57.170 --> 05:32:57.180 align:start position:0%
our country's Resources by Congress I'm
 
05:32:59.868 --> 05:32:59.878 align:start position:0%
17 years old therefore I cannot vote yet
 
05:33:02.330 --> 05:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
and I cannot vote on what my taxes are
 
05:33:05.510 --> 05:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:07.910 --> 05:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
this means my generation and the future
 
05:33:10.190 --> 05:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
Generations after my time are going to
 
05:33:11.810 --> 05:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
be held responsible for the debt of
 
05:33:14.030 --> 05:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
which we couldn't even vote on not only
 
05:33:16.190 --> 05:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
that but with Congress having no time
 
05:33:18.288 --> 05:33:18.298 align:start position:0%
limits set in place
 
05:33:20.030 --> 05:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
our voices will likely never be
 
05:33:22.670 --> 05:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
understood by the current Congress
 
05:33:24.830 --> 05:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
with that I would lastly like to say
 
05:33:27.470 --> 05:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
Winston Omnia where it toss and thank
 
05:33:30.788 --> 05:33:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:33.830 --> 05:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Brody and I'll be
 
05:33:35.208 --> 05:33:35.218 align:start position:0%
speaking as well as on behalf of
 
05:33:37.368 --> 05:33:37.378 align:start position:0%
convention Estates
 
05:33:40.128 --> 05:33:40.138 align:start position:0%
um I'm asking you to vote Yes the reason
 
05:33:43.010 --> 05:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
that um me and my brother as well as all
 
05:33:44.570 --> 05:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
of our generation will be the future of
 
05:33:48.050 --> 05:33:48.060 align:start position:0%
America and I feel what I'm sorry now I
 
05:33:49.550 --> 05:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
feel like we are not being represented
 
05:33:53.330 --> 05:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
as the younger new generation and I also
 
05:33:56.448 --> 05:33:56.458 align:start position:0%
feel like even though I cannot work or
 
05:33:58.970 --> 05:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
vote that my future tax dollars are
 
05:34:03.350 --> 05:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
being spent carelessly without any minor
 
05:34:06.948 --> 05:34:06.958 align:start position:0%
thought on where they're going to
 
05:34:06.958 --> 05:34:07.610 align:start position:0%
thought on where they're going to
um

05:34:07.610 --> 05:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:09.530 --> 05:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
with that being said
 
05:34:12.770 --> 05:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
thank you all for your time and have a
 
05:34:13.910 --> 05:34:13.920 align:start position:0%

05:34:20.448 --> 05:34:20.458 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:34:22.128 --> 05:34:22.138 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions for
 
05:34:25.970 --> 05:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:28.128 --> 05:34:28.138 align:start position:0%
Cena thank you both for taking the time
 
05:34:30.830 --> 05:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
to be here thank you very much
 
05:34:40.190 --> 05:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:42.050 --> 05:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
the representative former representative
 
05:34:44.628 --> 05:34:44.638 align:start position:0%
for Nashua is that
 
05:34:48.890 --> 05:34:48.900 align:start position:0%
yes if you come up and uh for a clerk if
 
05:34:57.170 --> 05:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:59.390 --> 05:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair members of the
 
05:35:01.250 --> 05:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Erica Victoria
 
05:35:04.010 --> 05:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
Eastman and your past lifetime served
 
05:35:06.050 --> 05:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
here in this helgus chamber very proudly
 
05:35:09.650 --> 05:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
and it's a thrill to be back uh before
 
05:35:13.128 --> 05:35:13.138 align:start position:0%
my former committee as it happens
 
05:35:16.030 --> 05:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just here to speak briefly about
 
05:35:19.610 --> 05:35:19.620 align:start position:0%
change and imperative
 
05:35:21.410 --> 05:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
life has changed we've all heard that
 
05:35:21.420 --> 05:35:22.610 align:start position:0%
life has changed we've all heard that
adage

05:35:22.610 --> 05:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
adage
 
05:35:25.368 --> 05:35:25.378 align:start position:0%
sometimes big changes occur in
 
05:35:26.930 --> 05:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
everyone's life and in the course of the
 
05:35:29.150 --> 05:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
lifetime of a nation that have
 
05:35:31.070 --> 05:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
tremendous imperatives other times as
 
05:35:33.948 --> 05:35:33.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:36.350 --> 05:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
but when those imperatives present
 
05:35:36.360 --> 05:35:37.730 align:start position:0%
but when those imperatives present
themselves

05:35:37.730 --> 05:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
05:35:40.190 --> 05:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
we find ourselves faced with unknown
 
05:35:40.200 --> 05:35:41.628 align:start position:0%
we find ourselves faced with unknown
factors

05:35:41.628 --> 05:35:41.638 align:start position:0%
factors
 
05:35:45.650 --> 05:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
and unknown uh strategies or unclear
 
05:35:47.868 --> 05:35:47.878 align:start position:0%
strategies in order to confront them
 
05:35:49.910 --> 05:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
overcome them and move on
 
05:35:53.030 --> 05:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
and hopefully move on to a better place
 
05:35:55.910 --> 05:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
I know a little bit about change quite
 
05:35:58.430 --> 05:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
evidently and this nation certainly does
 
05:35:58.440 --> 05:36:00.890 align:start position:0%
evidently and this nation certainly does
too

05:36:00.890 --> 05:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:03.530 --> 05:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
the mechanism of Article 5 is simply a
 
05:36:05.330 --> 05:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
road map
 
05:36:08.150 --> 05:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
has it ever been done
 
05:36:11.090 --> 05:36:11.100 align:start position:0%
well attempts have been made
 
05:36:13.190 --> 05:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
many many many times
 
05:36:16.788 --> 05:36:16.798 align:start position:0%
but the actual manifestation
 
05:36:18.830 --> 05:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
of a Convention of States is an
 
05:36:23.448 --> 05:36:23.458 align:start position:0%
unprecedented event here in this country
 
05:36:25.850 --> 05:36:25.860 align:start position:0%
does that mean it's not viable of course
 
05:36:25.860 --> 05:36:27.530 align:start position:0%
does that mean it's not viable of course
not

05:36:27.530 --> 05:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:36:29.510 --> 05:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
lots of people in the course of their
 
05:36:32.690 --> 05:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
lives confront change
 
05:36:34.850 --> 05:36:34.860 align:start position:0%
for which they have no roadmap all they
 
05:36:36.170 --> 05:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
have is conviction
 
05:36:39.650 --> 05:36:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:41.628 --> 05:36:41.638 align:start position:0%
and they handle it
 
05:36:43.850 --> 05:36:43.860 align:start position:0%
they innovate if they have to
 
05:36:43.860 --> 05:36:45.708 align:start position:0%
they innovate if they have to
improvise

05:36:45.708 --> 05:36:45.718 align:start position:0%
improvise
 
05:36:47.510 --> 05:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
in this particular instance in the life
 
05:36:50.750 --> 05:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
of our nation we don't have to do that
 
05:36:55.128 --> 05:36:55.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:58.970 --> 05:36:58.980 align:start position:0%
we have a mechanism in place
 
05:37:02.090 --> 05:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
I've confronted immense change in my
 
05:37:03.830 --> 05:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
life and didn't have one of those didn't
 
05:37:06.050 --> 05:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
have any of that
 
05:37:07.170 --> 05:37:07.180 align:start position:0%
so what does it take
 
05:37:07.180 --> 05:37:09.050 align:start position:0%
so what does it take
[Music]

05:37:09.050 --> 05:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:37:11.030 --> 05:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
it takes a recognition
 
05:37:14.510 --> 05:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
of the degree of imperative
 
05:37:14.520 --> 05:37:15.490 align:start position:0%
of the degree of imperative
why

05:37:15.490 --> 05:37:15.500 align:start position:0%
why
 
05:37:15.500 --> 05:37:16.910 align:start position:0%
why
[Music]

05:37:16.910 --> 05:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:37:16.920 --> 05:37:18.230 align:start position:0%
[Music]
why

05:37:18.230 --> 05:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
why
 
05:37:21.010 --> 05:37:21.020 align:start position:0%
fix this
 
05:37:26.390 --> 05:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
well if the Y is big enough the what
 
05:37:29.090 --> 05:37:29.100 align:start position:0%
will present itself as you go
 
05:37:33.050 --> 05:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
luckily in this case we have a what
 
05:37:36.530 --> 05:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
but now we also have a why
 
05:37:38.270 --> 05:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
bear that in mind members of the
 
05:37:40.190 --> 05:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
committee please as you move forward
 
05:37:43.190 --> 05:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
to vote on this matter
 
05:37:45.590 --> 05:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
the why is valid
 
05:37:47.150 --> 05:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
the what
 
05:37:49.910 --> 05:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
is already delineated in our founding
 
05:37:49.920 --> 05:37:51.770 align:start position:0%
is already delineated in our founding
documents

05:37:51.770 --> 05:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
documents
 
05:37:55.190 --> 05:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
the precedent for that what it exists
 
05:37:57.650 --> 05:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
throughout the course of history in this
 
05:37:57.660 --> 05:38:00.128 align:start position:0%
throughout the course of history in this
nation

05:38:00.128 --> 05:38:00.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:04.190 --> 05:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:06.890 --> 05:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
A change is hard change is good and it's
 
05:38:06.900 --> 05:38:08.448 align:start position:0%
A change is hard change is good and it's
inevitable

05:38:08.448 --> 05:38:08.458 align:start position:0%
inevitable
 
05:38:10.610 --> 05:38:10.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
05:38:12.350 --> 05:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
would you take any questions if there
 
05:38:14.090 --> 05:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
are any
 
05:38:16.430 --> 05:38:16.440 align:start position:0%

I am your support thank you of this

resolution representing the people of
 
05:38:26.340 --> 05:38:31.610 align:start position:0%
resolution representing the people of
Nashua

05:38:31.610 --> 05:38:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:34.670 --> 05:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:36.890 --> 05:38:36.900 align:start position:0%

05:38:39.948 --> 05:38:39.958 align:start position:0%
I have here next up Ross Payne from

05:39:20.150 --> 05:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
05:39:22.610 --> 05:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee
 
05:39:25.250 --> 05:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen
 
05:39:28.368 --> 05:39:28.378 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm from Merrimack
 
05:39:30.830 --> 05:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
I oppose hcr1
 
05:39:33.890 --> 05:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
it attacks what makes America the
 
05:39:37.788 --> 05:39:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:41.288 --> 05:39:41.298 align:start position:0%
it's not our land and natural resources
 
05:39:46.430 --> 05:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
or our people who have fled from tyranny
 
05:39:49.550 --> 05:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
it's the Constitution
 
05:39:51.890 --> 05:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
that has kept us free
 
05:39:53.628 --> 05:39:53.638 align:start position:0%
part two
 
05:39:58.010 --> 05:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:01.730 --> 05:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
it does not need to be fixed it just
 
05:40:10.368 --> 05:40:10.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:13.490 --> 05:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
okay because we the people
 
05:40:17.930 --> 05:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
have made poor choices at The Ballot Box
 
05:40:20.270 --> 05:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
the source of our runaway federal
 
05:40:20.280 --> 05:40:21.350 align:start position:0%
the source of our runaway federal
government

05:40:21.350 --> 05:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:40:24.288 --> 05:40:24.298 align:start position:0%
is the image that looks back at us from
 
05:40:27.470 --> 05:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:29.690 --> 05:40:29.700 align:start position:0%
there are other ways to limit Federal
 
05:40:32.150 --> 05:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
power and the state government has a
 
05:40:34.430 --> 05:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
checks and balance and that's State
 
05:40:34.440 --> 05:40:37.788 align:start position:0%
checks and balance and that's State
nullification

05:40:37.788 --> 05:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:41.208 --> 05:40:41.218 align:start position:0%
Article 5 conventions are dangerous for
 
05:40:44.690 --> 05:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
documented historical precedents reveal
 
05:40:47.890 --> 05:40:47.900 align:start position:0%
that James Madison
 
05:40:50.750 --> 05:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
observation that he trembles with the
 
05:40:54.288 --> 05:40:54.298 align:start position:0%
results of a second convention is wisdom
 
05:40:55.430 --> 05:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
that is
 
05:40:59.270 --> 05:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
critical the passing judgment on Article
 
05:41:00.830 --> 05:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
5 conventions
 
05:41:06.288 --> 05:41:06.298 align:start position:0%
as early as 1776 Madison saw the dangers
 
05:41:08.690 --> 05:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
that loom in our future if another
 
05:41:11.448 --> 05:41:11.458 align:start position:0%
another article 5 convention becomes
 
05:41:11.458 --> 05:41:13.190 align:start position:0%
another article 5 convention becomes
reality

05:41:13.190 --> 05:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
reality
 
05:41:15.590 --> 05:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
where the founders invoked the premise
 
05:41:18.770 --> 05:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
in the Declaration of Independence that
 
05:41:22.368 --> 05:41:22.378 align:start position:0%
the people held a self-evident right to
 
05:41:22.378 --> 05:41:23.628 align:start position:0%
the people held a self-evident right to
alter

05:41:23.628 --> 05:41:23.638 align:start position:0%
alter
 
05:41:27.708 --> 05:41:27.718 align:start position:0%
or abolish their government and set up a
 
05:41:30.470 --> 05:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
new government to throw off British
 
05:41:32.990 --> 05:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
Monarchy monarchy
 
05:41:36.350 --> 05:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
the second time Madison invoked this
 
05:41:39.230 --> 05:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
self-evident right to throw off tyranny
 
05:41:43.310 --> 05:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
in 1787 to replace the Articles of
 
05:41:46.190 --> 05:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
Confederation the fact that both George
 
05:41:46.200 --> 05:41:47.690 align:start position:0%
Confederation the fact that both George
Soros

05:41:47.690 --> 05:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
Soros
 
05:41:50.270 --> 05:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
and the Koch brothers and many socialist
 
05:41:50.280 --> 05:41:52.190 align:start position:0%
and the Koch brothers and many socialist
billionaires

05:41:52.190 --> 05:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
billionaires
 
05:41:55.850 --> 05:41:55.860 align:start position:0%
fund this movement doesn't this mean
 
05:41:59.690 --> 05:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
they have bought the opinions of cos and
 
05:41:59.700 --> 05:42:09.050 align:start position:0%
they have bought the opinions of cos and
Wolfpack

05:42:09.050 --> 05:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:13.070 --> 05:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:16.610 --> 05:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
their con job is it can't be a runaway
 
05:42:16.620 --> 05:42:18.170 align:start position:0%
their con job is it can't be a runaway
convention

05:42:18.170 --> 05:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
convention
 
05:42:21.708 --> 05:42:21.718 align:start position:0%
but because any Article 5 convention is
 
05:42:24.948 --> 05:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
a representation of The Sovereign will
 
05:42:28.190 --> 05:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
of the people the threat is we will
 
05:42:32.330 --> 05:42:32.340 align:start position:0%
duplicate what happens in 1787.
 
05:42:35.330 --> 05:42:35.340 align:start position:0%
unfortunately Washington Madison
 
05:42:38.750 --> 05:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
Hamilton and Jay will not be there to
 
05:42:40.730 --> 05:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
guard our Liberty
 
05:42:43.670 --> 05:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
don't you think it's time
 
05:42:45.708 --> 05:42:45.718 align:start position:0%
that Mark meckler
 
05:42:49.430 --> 05:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
of cos accepts the John Birch society's
 
05:42:54.490 --> 05:42:54.500 align:start position:0%
expert on this subject Robert Brown
 
05:42:56.628 --> 05:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
challenged a ten thousand dollar
 
05:42:58.550 --> 05:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
challenge that was given I believe in
 
05:43:00.890 --> 05:43:00.900 align:start position:0%
Montana several years ago
 
05:43:03.948 --> 05:43:03.958 align:start position:0%
to debate Robert Brown on this issue I'd
 
05:43:05.750 --> 05:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
like to see him
 
05:43:08.270 --> 05:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire and debate Robert
 
05:43:08.280 --> 05:43:13.128 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire and debate Robert
Brown

05:43:13.128 --> 05:43:13.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:16.730 --> 05:43:16.740 align:start position:0%
I believe that's and I have a picture of
 
05:43:20.090 --> 05:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
I will give committee a picture but wolf
 
05:43:20.100 --> 05:43:21.050 align:start position:0%
I will give committee a picture but wolf
pack

05:43:21.050 --> 05:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
pack
 
05:43:23.810 --> 05:43:23.820 align:start position:0%
in 2016.
 
05:43:27.708 --> 05:43:27.718 align:start position:0%
their lobbyist Ryan Clayton standing in
 
05:43:30.288 --> 05:43:30.298 align:start position:0%

05:43:32.628 --> 05:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
wolf pack lobbyist
 
05:43:34.430 --> 05:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
Ryan Clayton
 
05:43:37.788 --> 05:43:37.798 align:start position:0%
in Concord in 2016. there's a bunch of
 
05:43:37.798 --> 05:43:38.990 align:start position:0%
in Concord in 2016. there's a bunch of
ladies

05:43:38.990 --> 05:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
ladies
 
05:43:41.690 --> 05:43:41.700 align:start position:0%
that don't want
 
05:43:44.090 --> 05:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
Convention of states or wolf packs
 
05:43:48.110 --> 05:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
convention calls and they got signs
 
05:43:50.750 --> 05:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
that Mr Clayton is standing out in front
 
05:43:52.430 --> 05:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
of them
 
05:43:55.010 --> 05:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
and they don't know it but he's has a
 
05:43:57.170 --> 05:43:57.180 align:start position:0%
sign language for him
 
05:43:59.930 --> 05:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
a vulgar sign language right here in his
 
05:43:59.940 --> 05:44:01.368 align:start position:0%
a vulgar sign language right here in his
stomach

05:44:01.368 --> 05:44:01.378 align:start position:0%
stomach

it got held up administratively and on
 
05:45:19.970 --> 05:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
the floor of the house in one of those
 
05:45:22.910 --> 05:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
Marathon sessions before the crossover
 
05:45:26.990 --> 05:45:27.000 align:start position:0%

05:45:29.090 --> 05:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
Representatives threatened to filibuster

I don't want that to happen again
 
05:45:39.770 --> 05:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
but ask yourself this in the six years
 
05:45:41.390 --> 05:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
since this committee
 
05:45:43.730 --> 05:45:43.740 align:start position:0%

has the federal government
 
05:45:54.708 --> 05:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
overreached less
 
05:45:54.718 --> 05:45:57.110 align:start position:0%
overreached less
no

05:45:57.110 --> 05:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:45:59.390 --> 05:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
is the influence of lobbyists and dark
 
05:46:03.230 --> 05:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
money on incumbent politicians less
 
05:46:06.230 --> 05:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
no everything is gone in the wrong
 
05:46:08.810 --> 05:46:08.820 align:start position:0%
direction and you have the power to
 
05:46:12.230 --> 05:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
start the wheel turning that gives the
 
05:46:14.330 --> 05:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
American people the opportunity
 
05:46:18.110 --> 05:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
to write this ship
 
05:46:20.270 --> 05:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
the Constitution gives State
 
05:46:23.150 --> 05:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
legislatures the co-equal responsibility
 
05:46:24.830 --> 05:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
with Congress
 
05:46:28.788 --> 05:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
to propose amendments not to not to do
 
05:46:31.430 --> 05:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
anything else other than to propose them
 
05:46:33.948 --> 05:46:33.958 align:start position:0%
Congress can do it directly you can do
 
05:46:37.610 --> 05:46:37.620 align:start position:0%
it through a conventional States
 
05:46:39.650 --> 05:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
please do your duty
 
05:46:43.070 --> 05:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
and forward HCR one with the unanimous
 
05:46:45.650 --> 05:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
agreement that it ought to pass the
 
05:46:48.650 --> 05:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
house and please get it on the calendar
 
05:46:51.170 --> 05:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
early so we don't get jammed up
 
05:46:54.350 --> 05:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
in the crossover period thank you
 
05:46:58.490 --> 05:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:02.390 --> 05:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
are there any questions ever so Kerry
 
05:47:04.670 --> 05:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
so why do you think this has repeatedly
 
05:47:07.970 --> 05:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
failed here in New Hampshire as I said
 
05:47:10.430 --> 05:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
we've got a small
 
05:47:13.510 --> 05:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
group of folks who oppose a convention
 
05:47:16.730 --> 05:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
on what I would call
 
05:47:18.708 --> 05:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
emotional terms
 
05:47:20.690 --> 05:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
they're convinced that it would run away
 
05:47:23.690 --> 05:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
they're convinced that it would be a
 
05:47:25.910 --> 05:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
danger to the Constitution especially to
 
05:47:27.830 --> 05:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
the Second Amendment both of which are
 
05:47:27.840 --> 05:47:28.730 align:start position:0%
the Second Amendment both of which are
bunk

05:47:28.730 --> 05:47:28.740 align:start position:0%
bunk
 
05:47:32.270 --> 05:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
but they're convinced and no amount of
 
05:47:36.110 --> 05:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
facts no amount of history as uh Dr
 
05:47:38.030 --> 05:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
Ferris talked about or
 
05:47:41.810 --> 05:47:41.820 align:start position:0%
uh will sway them and that's why it has
 
05:47:44.208 --> 05:47:44.218 align:start position:0%
to if it needs to go to a full debate on
 
05:47:45.350 --> 05:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
the house
 
05:47:48.230 --> 05:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
so that all the house can can
 
05:47:50.570 --> 05:47:50.580 align:start position:0%
talk to this minority make up their own
 
05:47:53.330 --> 05:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
minds and make and have a reasonable
 
05:47:56.330 --> 05:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
time to to debate and vote on it I think
 
05:47:58.788 --> 05:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
that's the best thing that can happen
 
05:47:58.798 --> 05:48:00.470 align:start position:0%
that's the best thing that can happen
yeah

05:48:00.470 --> 05:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:48:04.368 --> 05:48:04.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:06.770 --> 05:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
you see Nanny thank you again for taking
 
05:48:07.910 --> 05:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
the time to be here and for your
 
05:48:11.030 --> 05:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
testimony is Christine
 
05:48:14.448 --> 05:48:14.458 align:start position:0%
lavecchio here it's a third lavecchio
 
05:48:16.610 --> 05:48:16.620 align:start position:0%
with the other probably with the the two
 
05:48:16.620 --> 05:48:18.110 align:start position:0%
with the other probably with the the two
boys

05:48:18.110 --> 05:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
boys
 
05:48:20.750 --> 05:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
she'd ask for one minute I uh
 
05:48:24.708 --> 05:48:24.718 align:start position:0%
I think that we're good with her
 
05:48:30.470 --> 05:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:32.150 --> 05:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
Charles is here from Peterborough
 
05:48:34.430 --> 05:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
representing himself speaking for the
 
05:48:37.368 --> 05:48:37.378 align:start position:0%
Bill he asked for a few a few minutes or
 
05:48:40.368 --> 05:48:40.378 align:start position:0%
a few moments uh thank you Mr chairman
 
05:48:43.548 --> 05:48:43.558 align:start position:0%
the committee uh I'm happy to be here uh
 
05:48:44.930 --> 05:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
I think most of what I was going to say
 
05:48:48.530 --> 05:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
has been said uh but uh we'll just bear
 
05:48:52.128 --> 05:48:52.138 align:start position:0%
with me for a moment or two uh the uh
 
05:48:54.830 --> 05:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
the debt burden was mentioned several
 
05:48:57.830 --> 05:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
times today it's a colossal burden
 
05:49:01.548 --> 05:49:01.558 align:start position:0%
uh I was born in Washington DC 77 years
 
05:49:06.048 --> 05:49:06.058 align:start position:0%
ago and I remember the year 2000 I think
 
05:49:08.270 --> 05:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
when Clinton was President and the
 
05:49:10.128 --> 05:49:10.138 align:start position:0%
Congress was doing its job we actually
 
05:49:12.610 --> 05:49:12.620 align:start position:0%
had a couple of surpluses
 
05:49:16.868 --> 05:49:16.878 align:start position:0%
and also from from uh
 
05:49:20.390 --> 05:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
1789 to 1930
 
05:49:23.390 --> 05:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
that's like 140 years we only had about
 
05:49:26.448 --> 05:49:26.458 align:start position:0%
40 deficit years and that included the
 
05:49:28.970 --> 05:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
Civil War and a couple of other terrible
 
05:49:31.850 --> 05:49:31.860 align:start position:0%
things so uh it's really gotten it's
 
05:49:33.470 --> 05:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
it's unbelievable I don't know where the
 
05:49:35.510 --> 05:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
gentleman was speaking of before that
 
05:49:39.250 --> 05:49:39.260 align:start position:0%
thought things were getting better
 
05:49:43.788 --> 05:49:43.798 align:start position:0%
unbelievably better and worse and uh
 
05:49:46.788 --> 05:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
many of the risks and uncertainties have
 
05:49:48.288 --> 05:49:48.298 align:start position:0%
been addressed nicely to have a
 
05:49:48.298 --> 05:49:49.330 align:start position:0%
been addressed nicely to have a
convention

05:49:49.330 --> 05:49:49.340 align:start position:0%
convention
 
05:49:52.628 --> 05:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
and also if you don't have a convention
 
05:49:58.010 --> 05:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:02.150 --> 05:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's unbelievable to me and I grew up my
 
05:50:03.708 --> 05:50:03.718 align:start position:0%
mother was born in Jaffrey New Hampshire
 
05:50:07.128 --> 05:50:07.138 align:start position:0%
I was I've spent almost all my life in
 
05:50:09.890 --> 05:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and uh it's a wonderful
 
05:50:09.900 --> 05:50:11.330 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and uh it's a wonderful
state

05:50:11.330 --> 05:50:11.340 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:50:13.610 --> 05:50:13.620 align:start position:0%
it's a well-run state it's fiscally
 
05:50:17.448 --> 05:50:17.458 align:start position:0%
conservative and uh people are respected
 
05:50:19.850 --> 05:50:19.860 align:start position:0%
and the people are nice and we don't
 
05:50:21.890 --> 05:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
have the crime and the bad water and the
 
05:50:24.530 --> 05:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
bad air and everything else but uh at
 
05:50:27.590 --> 05:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
the at the federal level the old saying
 
05:50:31.070 --> 05:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
all power corrupts
 
05:50:33.650 --> 05:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
and absolute power corrupts absolutely
 
05:50:37.910 --> 05:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
and it's been proven in Spades uh in the
 
05:50:37.920 --> 05:50:39.590 align:start position:0%
and it's been proven in Spades uh in the
last

05:50:39.590 --> 05:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
last
 
05:50:42.650 --> 05:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
number of years and we've got a a
 
05:50:42.660 --> 05:50:44.510 align:start position:0%
number of years and we've got a a
congress

05:50:44.510 --> 05:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
congress
 
05:50:48.530 --> 05:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
uh which writes vague legislation so
 
05:50:51.890 --> 05:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
that an unelected bureaucracy can do all
 
05:50:52.910 --> 05:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
05:50:57.410 --> 05:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
horrible things that really stymie my
 
05:50:59.750 --> 05:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
sister spent 17 years building a
 
05:51:02.510 --> 05:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
community theater in Jaffe New Hampshire
 
05:51:05.810 --> 05:51:05.820 align:start position:0%
it took us 17 years to pass all the
 
05:51:08.628 --> 05:51:08.638 align:start position:0%
regulations and the zoning and this and
 
05:51:11.150 --> 05:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
that and bringing power in and now it's
 
05:51:14.530 --> 05:51:14.540 align:start position:0%
a wonderful It's a Wonderful community
 
05:51:17.030 --> 05:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
structure right now with all kinds of
 
05:51:20.448 --> 05:51:20.458 align:start position:0%
artistic events from the grade schools
 
05:51:22.730 --> 05:51:22.740 align:start position:0%
and elementary schools and colleges in
 
05:51:25.490 --> 05:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
the area and Civic groups all kinds of
 
05:51:28.368 --> 05:51:28.378 align:start position:0%
things so but that shows you the I mean
 
05:51:30.048 --> 05:51:30.058 align:start position:0%
today what do we need we don't have a
 
05:51:31.430 --> 05:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
shortage of natural gas we need
 
05:51:34.850 --> 05:51:34.860 align:start position:0%
pipelines we can't build a pipeline
 
05:51:37.910 --> 05:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
the the great navigable Rivers Act was
 
05:51:40.850 --> 05:51:40.860 align:start position:0%
passed like in the 1970s it was supposed
 
05:51:43.190 --> 05:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
to be for bodies of water they could
 
05:51:45.048 --> 05:51:45.058 align:start position:0%
transport large ships
 
05:51:48.350 --> 05:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
carrying goods in merchandise and now
 
05:51:51.948 --> 05:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
apparently if you've got a a a a spring
 
05:51:54.110 --> 05:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
Vernal pool in your backyard they can
 
05:51:57.590 --> 05:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
they can oversee that it's just uh
 
05:52:00.948 --> 05:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
it's just a a very unfortunate and it
 
05:52:03.110 --> 05:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
improves the old outage the road to hell
 
05:52:05.150 --> 05:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
is paved with good intentions people
 
05:52:10.010 --> 05:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
mean well but the power is just uh uh
 
05:52:11.628 --> 05:52:11.638 align:start position:0%
something that is really the and that's
 
05:52:13.970 --> 05:52:13.980 align:start position:0%
what the founders worried about they had
 
05:52:15.530 --> 05:52:15.540 align:start position:0%
the three branches of the federal
 
05:52:17.868 --> 05:52:17.878 align:start position:0%
government they had the shared federal
 
05:52:22.850 --> 05:52:22.860 align:start position:0%
state uh uh federalism which to diffuse
 
05:52:22.860 --> 05:52:24.110 align:start position:0%
state uh uh federalism which to diffuse
power

05:52:24.110 --> 05:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
power
 
05:52:25.788 --> 05:52:25.798 align:start position:0%
now we have presidents that have
 
05:52:28.070 --> 05:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
executive orders Congress which doesn't
 
05:52:31.670 --> 05:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
do which job they don't the United
 
05:52:34.490 --> 05:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
States senators and representatives you
 
05:52:36.530 --> 05:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
know until recently all they could do
 
05:52:39.470 --> 05:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
was sit in the very end say yes or no
 
05:52:41.390 --> 05:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
they couldn't offer amendments they
 
05:52:42.948 --> 05:52:42.958 align:start position:0%
couldn't have to face the Committees
 
05:52:46.190 --> 05:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
were shambles this was the United States
 
05:52:46.200 --> 05:52:47.448 align:start position:0%
were shambles this was the United States
Congress

05:52:47.448 --> 05:52:47.458 align:start position:0%
Congress
 
05:52:51.288 --> 05:52:51.298 align:start position:0%
it's just unbelievable so I think the
 
05:52:52.910 --> 05:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
dangers are much greater if you do
 
05:52:55.850 --> 05:52:55.860 align:start position:0%
nothing and and this is going to be a
 
05:52:57.350 --> 05:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
wonderful thing it can be a wonderful
 
05:52:59.270 --> 05:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
thing and we have wonderful people today
 
05:53:02.690 --> 05:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
talking about it so I I certainly uh
 
05:53:05.690 --> 05:53:05.700 align:start position:0%
would uh hope everybody here uh can get
 
05:53:07.310 --> 05:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
on board and do us
 
05:53:09.048 --> 05:53:09.058 align:start position:0%
the representative here said to have
 
05:53:11.868 --> 05:53:11.878 align:start position:0%

05:53:14.930 --> 05:53:14.940 align:start position:0%

speaking uh three minutes for the bill
 
05:53:34.010 --> 05:53:34.020 align:start position:0%

Gates I'm from moultonborough in Carroll
County

05:53:41.270 --> 05:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
County
 
05:53:44.570 --> 05:53:44.580 align:start position:0%
understandably when discussing Article 5
 
05:53:47.330 --> 05:53:47.340 align:start position:0%
of The Constitution and the convention
 
05:53:50.448 --> 05:53:50.458 align:start position:0%
Estates most people focus on the many
 
05:53:53.030 --> 05:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
serious problems that exist with our
 
05:53:55.310 --> 05:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
federal government today out of control
 
05:53:59.090 --> 05:53:59.100 align:start position:0%
spending the usurption of power and the
 
05:54:01.190 --> 05:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
lack of transparency but I'd like to
 
05:54:03.048 --> 05:54:03.058 align:start position:0%
spend the brief amount of time that I
 
05:54:05.990 --> 05:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
have with you today mentioning the
 
05:54:09.770 --> 05:54:09.780 align:start position:0%
process of conventionist states which I
 
05:54:12.948 --> 05:54:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:15.410 --> 05:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm not talking about the 34 states
 
05:54:17.510 --> 05:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
that are needed to hold the convention
 
05:54:19.310 --> 05:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
of States I think there's more to it
 
05:54:21.650 --> 05:54:21.660 align:start position:0%
than that foreign formidable requirement
 
05:54:23.690 --> 05:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
if you mentioned
 
05:54:27.948 --> 05:54:27.958 align:start position:0%
any one of the topics under hcr1
 
05:54:30.590 --> 05:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
most people have pretty strong opinions
 
05:54:31.730 --> 05:54:31.740 align:start position:0%
about them
 
05:54:33.890 --> 05:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
but until now there hasn't been a forum
 
05:54:36.410 --> 05:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
for the average citizen to join in the
 
05:54:39.470 --> 05:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
debate and yet these issues are vitally
 
05:54:41.990 --> 05:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
important to the future of Our Country
 
05:54:44.270 --> 05:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
Convention of states will provide us
 
05:54:47.750 --> 05:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
with the Forum needed to discuss and
 
05:54:50.390 --> 05:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
debate these important topics some of
 
05:54:52.970 --> 05:54:52.980 align:start position:0%
the proposals might actually be approved
 
05:54:56.868 --> 05:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
but any proposal that's approved must be
 
05:54:59.030 --> 05:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
sent back to all of the states for
 
05:54:59.040 --> 05:55:01.010 align:start position:0%
sent back to all of the states for
consideration

05:55:01.010 --> 05:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
05:55:04.390 --> 05:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
and you and then we need 38 state
 
05:55:07.128 --> 05:55:07.138 align:start position:0%
legislatures to approve it you know
 
05:55:09.830 --> 05:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
better than most how hard it is to get
 
05:55:11.930 --> 05:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
anything approved in a state legislature
 
05:55:15.350 --> 05:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
let alone 38 of them
 
05:55:18.170 --> 05:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
so anyone concerned about a runaway
 
05:55:18.180 --> 05:55:19.548 align:start position:0%
so anyone concerned about a runaway
convention

05:55:19.548 --> 05:55:19.558 align:start position:0%
convention
 
05:55:23.330 --> 05:55:23.340 align:start position:0%
should take comfort in the fact that
 
05:55:26.208 --> 05:55:26.218 align:start position:0%
there will be no approve or no amendment
 
05:55:29.470 --> 05:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
to the Constitution unless 38 State
 
05:55:32.990 --> 05:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
legislatures approve it
 
05:55:35.090 --> 05:55:35.100 align:start position:0%
the important thing this is my main
 
05:55:38.330 --> 05:55:38.340 align:start position:0%
point today is that there be a debate
 
05:55:40.430 --> 05:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
if you have a debate people will be
 
05:55:42.770 --> 05:55:42.780 align:start position:0%
satisfied that we were at least able to
 
05:55:44.810 --> 05:55:44.820 align:start position:0%
have the discussion
 
05:55:46.730 --> 05:55:46.740 align:start position:0%
in a format that was not being
 
05:55:48.530 --> 05:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
controlled by federal government
 
05:55:51.170 --> 05:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
employees many of whom are more
 
05:55:53.030 --> 05:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
concerned with maintaining their power
 
05:55:56.628 --> 05:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
even at the expense of our future
 
05:55:59.570 --> 05:55:59.580 align:start position:0%
so I urge you to allow us to have the
 
05:56:06.170 --> 05:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:08.390 --> 05:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Gates uh would you take any
 
05:56:08.400 --> 05:56:09.530 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Gates uh would you take any
questions

05:56:09.530 --> 05:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:56:14.930 --> 05:56:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:19.190 --> 05:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:23.030 --> 05:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
Joe torelli is Joe still here
 
05:56:24.890 --> 05:56:24.900 align:start position:0%
Joe is here what welcomes Joe from
 
05:56:28.250 --> 05:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
Hampton uh speaking up to five minutes
 
05:56:30.530 --> 05:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
for the bill I'll do my best and I
 
05:56:35.868 --> 05:56:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:37.548 --> 05:56:37.558 align:start position:0%
um my name is Joe torelli I live in
 
05:56:37.558 --> 05:56:38.750 align:start position:0%
um my name is Joe torelli I live in
Hampton

05:56:38.750 --> 05:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
Hampton
 
05:56:41.390 --> 05:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
I am a constitutional I do I Define
 
05:56:43.910 --> 05:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
myself as a constitutional libertarian
 
05:56:49.730 --> 05:56:49.740 align:start position:0%
because I am so often frustrated and
 
05:56:53.150 --> 05:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
re repulsed by the Democrat Party and
 
05:56:54.590 --> 05:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
the Republican party and their
 
05:56:57.110 --> 05:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
activities and what they do in our in
 
05:56:58.850 --> 05:56:58.860 align:start position:0%
our nation's capital
 
05:57:01.670 --> 05:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
and what I want to expose and Elevate is
 
05:57:03.410 --> 05:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
something that representative Potenza
 
05:57:07.788 --> 05:57:07.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier as did state senator
 
05:57:12.110 --> 05:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
um ribbons this is totally nonpartisan
 
05:57:15.708 --> 05:57:15.718 align:start position:0%
everything about this is nonpartisan
 
05:57:15.718 --> 05:57:17.208 align:start position:0%
everything about this is nonpartisan
when

05:57:17.208 --> 05:57:17.218 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:57:20.390 --> 05:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
when John Langdon had to postpone
 
05:57:23.390 --> 05:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
and adjourn the ratification convention
 
05:57:27.770 --> 05:57:27.780 align:start position:0%
in February of 8 1788 in Exeter it was
 
05:57:31.910 --> 05:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
because not enough people knew what the
 
05:57:33.948 --> 05:57:33.958 align:start position:0%
record what why we needed a Federal
 
05:57:36.770 --> 05:57:36.780 align:start position:0%
Constitution and one guy in Amherst
 
05:57:40.490 --> 05:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
Joshua Atherton said hey I've got these
 
05:57:44.090 --> 05:57:44.100 align:start position:0%
12 amendments I'd like to add to this
 
05:57:46.430 --> 05:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
12 amendments
 
05:57:49.010 --> 05:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
or later those 12 amendments 10 of them
 
05:57:53.330 --> 05:57:53.340 align:start position:0%
became our Bill of Rights Okay so
 
05:57:56.150 --> 05:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
Langdon adjourned the meeting in
 
05:57:59.410 --> 05:57:59.420 align:start position:0%
February of 1788 and met up the street
 
05:58:04.250 --> 05:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
here in the Old Town Meeting Hall
 
05:58:06.650 --> 05:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
which sits on States sits on the
 
05:58:09.230 --> 05:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
property that borders State Street and
 
05:58:10.850 --> 05:58:10.860 align:start position:0%
Church Street
 
05:58:12.530 --> 05:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
does that mean there's an intersection
 
05:58:16.610 --> 05:58:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:20.990 --> 05:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
so in February they spent 10 nine days
 
05:58:27.410 --> 05:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:30.948 --> 05:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
nine days debating three pages of the
 
05:58:33.470 --> 05:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
Constitution and Atherton helped to
 
05:58:36.530 --> 05:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
postpone it because there was so much to
 
05:58:39.590 --> 05:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
debate and discuss and so Langdon and
 
05:58:42.590 --> 05:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
John Sullivan said oh well we need to
 
05:58:46.128 --> 05:58:46.138 align:start position:0%
effectively using our terms today Market
 
05:58:48.948 --> 05:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
why we need a Federal Constitution let's
 
05:58:50.750 --> 05:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
hold off four months and meet in Concord
 
05:58:52.250 --> 05:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
which they did
 
05:58:55.610 --> 05:58:55.620 align:start position:0%
and on June 21st the solstice in 1788
 
05:58:55.620 --> 05:58:57.410 align:start position:0%
and on June 21st the solstice in 1788
1pm

05:58:57.410 --> 05:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
1pm
 
05:59:00.288 --> 05:59:00.298 align:start position:0%
not only did that group of people ratify
 
05:59:02.208 --> 05:59:02.218 align:start position:0%
the Constitution
 
05:59:04.250 --> 05:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire
 
05:59:07.310 --> 05:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
was the ninth state to do that
 
05:59:11.150 --> 05:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
which enacted the Constitution just up
 
05:59:12.830 --> 05:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
the road here the building burned down
 
05:59:14.990 --> 05:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
that's where binimedia is
 
05:59:17.510 --> 05:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
far right corner
 
05:59:21.048 --> 05:59:21.058 align:start position:0%
and when you think about the history of
 
05:59:23.510 --> 05:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
the ancestors of the state legislators
 
05:59:26.030 --> 05:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
that are that are seated today
 
05:59:29.090 --> 05:59:29.100 align:start position:0%
they did that
 
05:59:31.670 --> 05:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
I'd say that the state legislators are
 
05:59:35.270 --> 05:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
compelled as their Duty
 
05:59:39.530 --> 05:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
to pass this resolution you are the
 
05:59:42.110 --> 05:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
you are the check and balance
 
05:59:45.590 --> 05:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
among 33 other states to be able to get
 
05:59:49.368 --> 05:59:49.378 align:start position:0%
the process moving so that we can get
 
05:59:51.670 --> 05:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
this to happen
 
05:59:54.590 --> 05:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that we have and
 
05:59:57.288 --> 05:59:57.298 align:start position:0%
getting back to the non-partisan nature
 
05:59:58.730 --> 05:59:58.740 align:start position:0%
is that
 
06:00:01.910 --> 06:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
Democrats and Republicans
 
06:00:04.368 --> 06:00:04.378 align:start position:0%
in each state whether it's Bismarck
 
06:00:06.410 --> 06:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
whether it's Cheyenne
 
06:00:08.810 --> 06:00:08.820 align:start position:0%
whether it's Salem whether it's
 
06:00:08.820 --> 06:00:10.490 align:start position:0%
whether it's Salem whether it's
Tallahassee

06:00:10.490 --> 06:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
Tallahassee
 
06:00:12.470 --> 06:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
they should want to bring back these
 
06:00:15.350 --> 06:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
funds that are being sent to Washington
 
06:00:18.650 --> 06:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
to their state capitals so that the one
 
06:00:22.310 --> 06:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
size fits all is kind of like oh gee
 
06:00:24.590 --> 06:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
maybe it's better in the state of
 
06:00:27.708 --> 06:00:27.718 align:start position:0%
Washington to do this than it is in
 
06:00:27.718 --> 06:00:29.510 align:start position:0%
Washington to do this than it is in
Missouri

06:00:29.510 --> 06:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
Missouri
 
06:00:33.110 --> 06:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
and so we need to deconstruct the K
 
06:00:35.448 --> 06:00:35.458 align:start position:0%
Street lobbyist influence
 
06:00:37.548 --> 06:00:37.558 align:start position:0%
in Washington
 
06:00:40.490 --> 06:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
by addressing the three topics that are
 
06:00:42.048 --> 06:00:42.058 align:start position:0%
in this resolution
 
06:00:45.048 --> 06:00:45.058 align:start position:0%
so that we can begin to change this and
 
06:00:46.850 --> 06:00:46.860 align:start position:0%
bring it back and again I feel
 
06:00:46.860 --> 06:00:48.110 align:start position:0%
bring it back and again I feel
personally

06:00:48.110 --> 06:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
personally
 
06:00:49.970 --> 06:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
it is the duty of the state
 
06:00:51.650 --> 06:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
representatives and the state senators
 
06:00:54.470 --> 06:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
in each of the states to understand that
 
06:00:57.530 --> 06:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
you are the people that George Mason and
 
06:00:58.690 --> 06:00:58.700 align:start position:0%
James Madison
 
06:01:01.610 --> 06:01:01.620 align:start position:0%
actually figured was better than what
 
06:01:03.650 --> 06:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
Alexander Hamilton wanted to do with a
 
06:01:05.390 --> 06:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
music track underneath
 
06:01:08.090 --> 06:01:08.100 align:start position:0%
to only have Congress do it why would
 
06:01:10.070 --> 06:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
Congress be the only ones to to change
 
06:01:11.930 --> 06:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
the change the Constitution
 
06:01:13.970 --> 06:01:13.980 align:start position:0%
it had to go back to the States because
 
06:01:15.470 --> 06:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
every state was different there are only
 
06:01:18.470 --> 06:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
13 at the time now we have 50. so I'm
 
06:01:21.770 --> 06:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
going to finish 458 I'm done
 
06:01:24.110 --> 06:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions
 
06:01:25.910 --> 06:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
06:01:27.590 --> 06:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
or absolutely Carrie
 
06:01:30.470 --> 06:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
you cited a book uh that one that's
 
06:01:32.390 --> 06:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
about four inches thick would you give
 
06:01:35.090 --> 06:01:35.100 align:start position:0%
me the title yes I will and even better
 
06:01:38.330 --> 06:01:38.340 align:start position:0%
than that we are you know there's a a
 
06:01:40.750 --> 06:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
group of us that are working on
 
06:01:43.368 --> 06:01:43.378 align:start position:0%
condensed this the author condensed this
 
06:01:46.548 --> 06:01:46.558 align:start position:0%

06:01:53.570 --> 06:01:53.580 align:start position:0%

06:01:56.930 --> 06:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
so I can get you these and I can get
 
06:02:00.230 --> 06:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
them for both parties because this
 
06:02:03.670 --> 06:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
attacks the attacks and provides
 
06:02:05.990 --> 06:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
documented evidence of what the
 
06:02:08.628 --> 06:02:08.638 align:start position:0%
different challenges were and why
 
06:02:11.270 --> 06:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
this alone is 15 minutes reading time
 
06:02:15.948 --> 06:02:15.958 align:start position:0%
and it's like oh my gosh I had no idea
 
06:02:20.510 --> 06:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
so I offer this and more of them and we
 
06:02:22.250 --> 06:02:22.260 align:start position:0%
would love to get get them in the hands
 
06:02:23.628 --> 06:02:23.638 align:start position:0%
of each of the representatives so that
 
06:02:25.368 --> 06:02:25.378 align:start position:0%
they can read it but we also want to
 
06:02:27.288 --> 06:02:27.298 align:start position:0%
have a discussion and to talk about it I
 
06:02:28.490 --> 06:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
love the book
 
06:02:32.570 --> 06:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
sorry oh the book is far from unworkable
 
06:02:35.628 --> 06:02:35.638 align:start position:0%
and I would love to have the ability to
 
06:02:37.610 --> 06:02:37.620 align:start position:0%
put two of these in the State Library
 
06:02:40.250 --> 06:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
across the street so that you all can
 
06:02:42.788 --> 06:02:42.798 align:start position:0%
check it out and go to page
 
06:02:46.670 --> 06:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
736 there's 820 in here I have not read
 
06:02:49.670 --> 06:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
this but I have read enough of it to
 
06:02:51.948 --> 06:02:51.958 align:start position:0%
know that the evidence is all in here
 
06:02:54.410 --> 06:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
this is fantastic I was going to offer
 
06:02:57.410 --> 06:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
that as a stand for the microphone
 
06:02:59.750 --> 06:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative Finney I think you
 
06:03:01.310 --> 06:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
had a question
 
06:03:03.770 --> 06:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
the name of the book okay I'll hold it
 
06:03:05.690 --> 06:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
up for the camera camera's that way okay
 
06:03:08.330 --> 06:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
far from unworkable and it's Tim Dake
 
06:03:10.610 --> 06:03:10.620 align:start position:0%
and he's a professor from Wisconsin and
 
06:03:13.070 --> 06:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
it worked in Wisconsin it took a couple
 
06:03:14.208 --> 06:03:14.218 align:start position:0%
of years
 
06:03:17.030 --> 06:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
but they just passed in Wisconsin
 
06:03:20.090 --> 06:03:20.100 align:start position:0%
just a follow-up would you believe that
 
06:03:22.610 --> 06:03:22.620 align:start position:0%
my daughter's attended school on the
 
06:03:25.070 --> 06:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
site of The Walker School which was on
 
06:03:27.230 --> 06:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
the site of the previous meeting house
 
06:03:30.230 --> 06:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
at the corner of church state in Boonton
 
06:03:34.610 --> 06:03:34.620 align:start position:0%
how about and Putin so this is the book
 
06:03:37.310 --> 06:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
the the state legislature commissioned
 
06:03:40.368 --> 06:03:40.378 align:start position:0%
in 1888 on the 100th anniversary of it
 
06:03:43.128 --> 06:03:43.138 align:start position:0%
this is the actual 1888 book that
 
06:03:47.030 --> 06:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
describes uh walk um Langdon sending
 
06:03:49.010 --> 06:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
Walker to take five of the detractors
 
06:03:50.810 --> 06:03:50.820 align:start position:0%
out got them drunk so that they couldn't
 
06:03:53.208 --> 06:03:53.218 align:start position:0%
make the vote stuff like that but you
 
06:03:54.948 --> 06:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
know what dirty tricks or dirty tricks
 
06:03:57.110 --> 06:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
so whatever but I'm happy to and I'm
 
06:03:59.390 --> 06:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
happy to discuss it with anybody and go
 
06:04:01.250 --> 06:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
over this and this
 
06:04:04.190 --> 06:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
if anybody's interested thank you
 
06:04:05.628 --> 06:04:05.638 align:start position:0%
thank you and think of the history
 
06:04:09.048 --> 06:04:09.058 align:start position:0%
lesson in Brooklyn Curie so in a sense
 
06:04:12.530 --> 06:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:14.390 --> 06:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
I think in case our country was born at
 
06:04:17.390 --> 06:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
that spot and here in Concord in 1788 as
 
06:04:20.810 --> 06:04:20.820 align:start position:0%
as we know it Matthew Rhodes they say
 
06:04:30.128 --> 06:04:30.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:34.010 --> 06:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
yes you have 20 copies for us
 
06:04:35.810 --> 06:04:35.820 align:start position:0%
and we'll
 
06:04:38.628 --> 06:04:38.638 align:start position:0%
we'll get those to the to the Reps who
 
06:04:48.530 --> 06:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:50.750 --> 06:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for uh listening to
 
06:04:53.208 --> 06:04:53.218 align:start position:0%
me today and for being here and serving
 
06:04:55.310 --> 06:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire
 
06:04:55.320 --> 06:04:56.390 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire
um

06:04:56.390 --> 06:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:58.850 --> 06:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
so I'll remember what FDR said is to be
 
06:05:01.310 --> 06:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
sincere be brief and be seated
 
06:05:05.270 --> 06:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:06.770 --> 06:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
it's interesting here what's going on
 
06:05:09.288 --> 06:05:09.298 align:start position:0%
today and I'm listening to the various
 
06:05:12.350 --> 06:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
testimonies uh concerning hrc1 and I
 
06:05:15.350 --> 06:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
wonder how we arrived as a nation at
 
06:05:17.150 --> 06:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
this point where we would see a pack so
 
06:05:19.368 --> 06:05:19.378 align:start position:0%
massive as the convention of States
 
06:05:21.288 --> 06:05:21.298 align:start position:0%
project pour in such a vast amount of
 
06:05:23.810 --> 06:05:23.820 align:start position:0%
resources and money into an effort that
 
06:05:25.670 --> 06:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
has really no blueprint despite what
 
06:05:28.128 --> 06:05:28.138 align:start position:0%
everything is being said here today
 
06:05:29.930 --> 06:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
while claiming the whole time that it
 
06:05:29.940 --> 06:05:30.770 align:start position:0%
while claiming the whole time that it
does

06:05:30.770 --> 06:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
does
 
06:05:32.930 --> 06:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
the Herculean effort to control water
 
06:05:35.170 --> 06:05:35.180 align:start position:0%
influence legislators across the country
 
06:05:37.730 --> 06:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
surely could have been spent on other
 
06:05:37.740 --> 06:05:38.868 align:start position:0%
surely could have been spent on other
efforts

06:05:38.868 --> 06:05:38.878 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
06:05:40.430 --> 06:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
that would have proven more immediately
 
06:05:42.110 --> 06:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
useful and beneficial to the American
 
06:05:42.120 --> 06:05:43.788 align:start position:0%
useful and beneficial to the American
people

06:05:43.788 --> 06:05:43.798 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:05:45.530 --> 06:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
instead we are debating under this
 
06:05:47.208 --> 06:05:47.218 align:start position:0%
Fantastical notion
 
06:05:49.128 --> 06:05:49.138 align:start position:0%
that somehow term limits is the magical
 
06:05:51.110 --> 06:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
answer to fixing a government
 
06:05:53.270 --> 06:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
that is out of control a government that
 
06:05:55.490 --> 06:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
acts immorally which ignores the
 
06:05:57.530 --> 06:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
constraints the Constitution
 
06:05:59.410 --> 06:05:59.420 align:start position:0%
already puts on it
 
06:06:01.850 --> 06:06:01.860 align:start position:0%
on their enumerated powers which are
 
06:06:04.970 --> 06:06:04.980 align:start position:0%
clearly stated in Article 1 Section 8.
 
06:06:07.788 --> 06:06:07.798 align:start position:0%
so term limits will not take corrupt
 
06:06:10.070 --> 06:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
people out of the circle of influence of
 
06:06:12.708 --> 06:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
government and in fact makes a newer and
 
06:06:14.150 --> 06:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
newer Freshman Class of naive
 
06:06:16.128 --> 06:06:16.138 align:start position:0%
legislators vulnerable to these
 
06:06:18.288 --> 06:06:18.298 align:start position:0%
peripherally located parasitic Army of
 
06:06:21.708 --> 06:06:21.718 align:start position:0%
lobbyists that invest Washington DC and
 
06:06:23.570 --> 06:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
I can tell you my ex-wife used to work
 
06:06:25.310 --> 06:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
for one of them and they really can't
 
06:06:27.470 --> 06:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
wait for this convention of states to
 
06:06:27.480 --> 06:06:28.310 align:start position:0%
wait for this convention of states to
pass

06:06:28.310 --> 06:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
pass
 
06:06:28.320 --> 06:06:30.110 align:start position:0%
pass
so

06:06:30.110 --> 06:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:06:32.448 --> 06:06:32.458 align:start position:0%
in short the amount of hands grasping at
 
06:06:34.850 --> 06:06:34.860 align:start position:0%
the public offers will not be reduced
 
06:06:37.190 --> 06:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
and as some recent Studies have shown an
 
06:06:39.288 --> 06:06:39.298 align:start position:0%
empirical data suggest and I think you
 
06:06:42.470 --> 06:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
can look at the ncsl website they have a
 
06:06:45.470 --> 06:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
very good uh article about does term
 
06:06:47.990 --> 06:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
limits take people out of office
 
06:06:50.628 --> 06:06:50.638 align:start position:0%
no it doesn't it doesn't reduce the
 
06:06:53.390 --> 06:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
amount of time people spend in office or
 
06:06:56.330 --> 06:06:56.340 align:start position:0%
in the sphere of influence over politics
 
06:06:58.310 --> 06:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
what we need to do is to look for a
 
06:06:59.810 --> 06:06:59.820 align:start position:0%
moral solution
 
06:07:02.510 --> 06:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
is what I'm suggesting here today
 
06:07:05.150 --> 06:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm not into and I'm not insinuating
 
06:07:07.490 --> 06:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
that anybody here is immoral and I'm not
 
06:07:09.530 --> 06:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
going to say that I don't think that
 
06:07:11.868 --> 06:07:11.878 align:start position:0%
we ever intentionally do things wrong
 
06:07:13.788 --> 06:07:13.798 align:start position:0%
but it is clear that sometimes we don't
 
06:07:16.010 --> 06:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
follow the Constitution and that's
 
06:07:18.470 --> 06:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
created the problem that we're in today
 
06:07:21.830 --> 06:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
what we need to uh so I say we returned
 
06:07:23.510 --> 06:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
to being a people will understand what
 
06:07:24.830 --> 06:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
the government is and as Thomas
 
06:07:27.890 --> 06:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
Jefferson says let the people of fully
 
06:07:30.048 --> 06:07:30.058 align:start position:0%
educated people be the deposit of
 
06:07:32.390 --> 06:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
Liberty in this country which we don't
 
06:07:32.400 --> 06:07:35.570 align:start position:0%
Liberty in this country which we don't
have

06:07:35.570 --> 06:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:37.670 --> 06:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
and of course some people think and
 
06:07:39.350 --> 06:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that the government is a
 
06:07:41.030 --> 06:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
giant candy store
 
06:07:42.770 --> 06:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
and our representatives are the
 
06:07:44.570 --> 06:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
dispensers of goodies like the Easter
 
06:07:47.090 --> 06:07:47.100 align:start position:0%
Bunny in Santa Claus and that creates
 
06:07:49.128 --> 06:07:49.138 align:start position:0%
problems year after year
 
06:07:51.530 --> 06:07:51.540 align:start position:0%
every year Pub Republicans and Democrats
 
06:07:53.330 --> 06:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
fight over their given voters over
 
06:07:55.310 --> 06:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
giving voters the things not lawfully
 
06:07:57.830 --> 06:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
Allowed by the Constitution and this
 
06:07:59.868 --> 06:07:59.878 align:start position:0%
Behavior has turned every election cycle
 
06:08:02.570 --> 06:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
into a war zone with the American people
 
06:08:04.490 --> 06:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
as victims
 
06:08:07.430 --> 06:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
this is the very source of our ills
 
06:08:11.750 --> 06:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
both the people and the elected
 
06:08:11.760 --> 06:08:14.390 align:start position:0%
both the people and the elected
mm-hmm

06:08:14.390 --> 06:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
06:08:16.310 --> 06:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
corruption can only be fixed by the
 
06:08:18.890 --> 06:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
electorate voting for moral people and
 
06:08:21.288 --> 06:08:21.298 align:start position:0%
not those who grant them the most favors
 
06:08:23.330 --> 06:08:23.340 align:start position:0%
so this isn't just a government problem
 
06:08:26.390 --> 06:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
this is a people problem because for all
 
06:08:27.830 --> 06:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
the people that you know like that are
 
06:08:30.170 --> 06:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
out there holding public office you have
 
06:08:31.730 --> 06:08:31.740 align:start position:0%
to remember there's somebody that voted
 
06:08:33.650 --> 06:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
for them and those are the people that
 
06:08:34.910 --> 06:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
don't understand what our our
 
06:08:37.970 --> 06:08:37.980 align:start position:0%
constitution says so if we go in and get
 
06:08:40.610 --> 06:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
everybody out of the picture and within
 
06:08:42.470 --> 06:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
it within a year or another cycle will
 
06:08:44.090 --> 06:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
have the same type of people back in
 
06:08:47.868 --> 06:08:47.878 align:start position:0%
even if it's just for a short time so
 
06:08:47.878 --> 06:08:48.830 align:start position:0%
even if it's just for a short time so
um

06:08:48.830 --> 06:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:51.288 --> 06:08:51.298 align:start position:0%
let's start today with every legislator
 
06:08:53.750 --> 06:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
in this room committing to upholding
 
06:08:55.788 --> 06:08:55.798 align:start position:0%
their oath to the Constitution stop
 
06:08:57.770 --> 06:08:57.780 align:start position:0%
taking Federal money that'd be a good
 
06:08:59.628 --> 06:08:59.638 align:start position:0%
place to start reducing the size of the
 
06:09:02.330 --> 06:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
government you just have to say no it's
 
06:09:04.368 --> 06:09:04.378 align:start position:0%
very simple it says so in the article 6
 
06:09:06.830 --> 06:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
of The Constitution not required to take
 
06:09:08.390 --> 06:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
all that big Federal money that's coming
 
06:09:10.670 --> 06:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
your way if you want less government you
 
06:09:16.670 --> 06:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:20.448 --> 06:09:20.458 align:start position:0%
so with the participation of our elected
 
06:09:23.270 --> 06:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
officials and the people we can return
 
06:09:25.970 --> 06:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
ourselves to the place of honor that
 
06:09:27.830 --> 06:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
America was in at one time
 
06:09:29.690 --> 06:09:29.700 align:start position:0%

measure
 
06:10:04.070 --> 06:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak in uh favor of the
 
06:10:06.590 --> 06:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
convention at Article Five okay
 
06:10:06.600 --> 06:10:07.310 align:start position:0%
convention at Article Five okay
um

06:10:07.310 --> 06:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:09.410 --> 06:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
and I just want to say a convention is
 
06:10:09.420 --> 06:10:10.430 align:start position:0%
and I just want to say a convention is
imminent

06:10:10.430 --> 06:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
imminent
 
06:10:12.230 --> 06:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's happening
 
06:10:14.090 --> 06:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
um in your lifetime
 
06:10:16.010 --> 06:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a convention in this
 
06:10:17.448 --> 06:10:17.458 align:start position:0%
country under Article 5 of The
 
06:10:20.030 --> 06:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution and legislators met from
 
06:10:23.208 --> 06:10:23.218 align:start position:0%
all across the country and
 
06:10:25.070 --> 06:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
um they were a bipartisan group
 
06:10:26.448 --> 06:10:26.458 align:start position:0%
they were authorized by their
 
06:10:27.890 --> 06:10:27.900 align:start position:0%
legislative Chambers they were called
 
06:10:29.628 --> 06:10:29.638 align:start position:0%
the Assembly of state legislators and
 
06:10:31.628 --> 06:10:31.638 align:start position:0%
they came up with rules
 
06:10:35.030 --> 06:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
these rules are not binding but they
 
06:10:37.490 --> 06:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
were proposed by a bipartisan group of
 
06:10:40.128 --> 06:10:40.138 align:start position:0%
legislators they were negotiated in
 
06:10:41.750 --> 06:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
Earnest from the people that were
 
06:10:44.030 --> 06:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
attending and I do believe that this is
 
06:10:46.368 --> 06:10:46.378 align:start position:0%
the blueprint for what the procedures
 
06:10:48.230 --> 06:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
will be at the convention so I just
 
06:10:49.490 --> 06:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to let everybody here on the
 
06:10:51.650 --> 06:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
committee know those that are you voted
 
06:10:55.128 --> 06:10:55.138 align:start position:0%
for a convention for other matters and
 
06:10:56.868 --> 06:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
those of you who voted against in the
 
06:10:58.910 --> 06:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
past I want you to imagine what a
 
06:10:59.990 --> 06:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
convention looks like when you read
 
06:11:01.310 --> 06:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
these because I think what it looks like
 
06:11:02.868 --> 06:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
is this chamber
 
06:11:05.208 --> 06:11:05.218 align:start position:0%
I think it looks like these people
 
06:11:06.770 --> 06:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
sitting in the seats I think it looks
 
06:11:09.170 --> 06:11:09.180 align:start position:0%
like the committee here before us today
 
06:11:11.208 --> 06:11:11.218 align:start position:0%
and maybe it'll be here
 
06:11:13.490 --> 06:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
you know but imagine what would happen
 
06:11:15.948 --> 06:11:15.958 align:start position:0%
if regular people or legislators state
 
06:11:17.510 --> 06:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
legislators from across the country got
 
06:11:20.570 --> 06:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
together to talk about seriously in
 
06:11:23.150 --> 06:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
Earnest what should we do about the
 
06:11:24.830 --> 06:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
problems facing our country and how can
 
06:11:26.390 --> 06:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
we propose amendments to the
 
06:11:28.548 --> 06:11:28.558 align:start position:0%
Constitution to the rest of the states
 
06:11:30.530 --> 06:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
so that they can have a chance and a
 
06:11:32.330 --> 06:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
choice to say whether or not they want
 
06:11:34.128 --> 06:11:34.138 align:start position:0%
that Amendment added so I would
 
06:11:36.048 --> 06:11:36.058 align:start position:0%
encourage you all to think very
 
06:11:37.910 --> 06:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
seriously about the prospect of article
 
06:11:40.788 --> 06:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
5. it's in the Constitution it's there
 
06:11:42.948 --> 06:11:42.958 align:start position:0%
since the beginning and anyone who
 
06:11:45.890 --> 06:11:45.900 align:start position:0%
opposes this on the grounds of Article 5
 
06:11:49.070 --> 06:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
on the idea of a convention I would just
 
06:11:51.110 --> 06:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
ask you what other parts of the
 
06:11:54.948 --> 06:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:56.150 --> 06:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
do you want to ignore the first
 
06:11:57.948 --> 06:11:57.958 align:start position:0%
amendment do you want to ignore the
 
06:11:59.510 --> 06:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment or any of the other
 
06:12:01.368 --> 06:12:01.378 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights because the way we got
 
06:12:02.930 --> 06:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
those like the gentleman mentioned
 
06:12:02.940 --> 06:12:03.770 align:start position:0%
those like the gentleman mentioned
earlier

06:12:03.770 --> 06:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
06:12:06.410 --> 06:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
is by using the convention and applying
 
06:12:08.330 --> 06:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
the pressure to Congress getting them to
 
06:12:10.128 --> 06:12:10.138 align:start position:0%
propose it and then ratifying them
 
06:12:11.330 --> 06:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
through the states
 
06:12:13.788 --> 06:12:13.798 align:start position:0%
so this is a state driven process
 
06:12:15.410 --> 06:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
you're the legislators that get to
 
06:12:17.330 --> 06:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not this happens and
 
06:12:18.590 --> 06:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
so we ask you
 
06:12:21.410 --> 06:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
please consider Article 5 an essential
 
06:12:23.208 --> 06:12:23.218 align:start position:0%
part of the Constitution an essential
 
06:12:25.430 --> 06:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
check and balance and remember that
 
06:12:26.390 --> 06:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
there are rules that have been
 
06:12:29.208 --> 06:12:29.218 align:start position:0%
negotiated by most of the legislative
 
06:12:30.708 --> 06:12:30.718 align:start position:0%
bodies and their authorized
 
06:12:32.810 --> 06:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
representatives and I can give a copy I
 
06:12:34.490 --> 06:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
only have three sorry I didn't print
 
06:12:36.288 --> 06:12:36.298 align:start position:0%
enough but I can give you a copy of
 
06:12:37.430 --> 06:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
these and you can read them it looks
 
06:12:39.830 --> 06:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
like pretty similar to your rules
 
06:12:42.410 --> 06:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your time
 
06:12:44.750 --> 06:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
06:12:46.788 --> 06:12:46.798 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
06:12:48.350 --> 06:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
if you could get at least one of those
 
06:12:50.208 --> 06:12:50.218 align:start position:0%
copies up here to the clerk that would
 
06:12:53.440 --> 06:12:53.450 align:start position:0%

06:14:12.708 --> 06:14:12.718 align:start position:0%
I'm Eric straff and I'm from Center
 
06:14:12.718 --> 06:14:15.590 align:start position:0%
I'm Eric straff and I'm from Center
Harbor

06:14:15.590 --> 06:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:17.868 --> 06:14:17.878 align:start position:0%
I rise today
 
06:14:21.350 --> 06:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
because I'm 78 years old
 
06:14:24.590 --> 06:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
I have five grandchildren
 
06:14:28.208 --> 06:14:28.218 align:start position:0%
and I love this nation
 
06:14:35.470 --> 06:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
that's over four 300 334 trillion
 
06:14:41.810 --> 06:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:43.850 --> 06:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
our federal government
 
06:14:47.390 --> 06:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
is working even as we speak
 
06:14:49.310 --> 06:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
to increase
 
06:14:52.190 --> 06:14:52.200 align:start position:0%
the national debt limit
 
06:14:55.250 --> 06:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
so they can run that 34 trillion through
 
06:14:59.930 --> 06:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:59.940 --> 06:15:01.788 align:start position:0%
 
you

06:15:01.788 --> 06:15:01.798 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:15:04.730 --> 06:15:04.740 align:start position:0%
are the only ones who can fix this
 
06:15:04.740 --> 06:15:07.788 align:start position:0%
are the only ones who can fix this
problem

06:15:07.788 --> 06:15:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:11.750 --> 06:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
you are the ones who call a Convention
 
06:15:13.610 --> 06:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
of states
 
06:15:16.970 --> 06:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
you can choose the delegates from New
 
06:15:16.980 --> 06:15:19.548 align:start position:0%
you can choose the delegates from New
Hampshire

06:15:19.548 --> 06:15:19.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:23.330 --> 06:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
you can chew uh you can set the rules
 
06:15:25.910 --> 06:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
for the delegates
 
06:15:28.610 --> 06:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
if a delegate does something wrong you

County
 
06:17:37.208 --> 06:17:37.218 align:start position:0%
sorry Deb Hobson is my representative
 
06:17:40.070 --> 06:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
and I have three pages here but I think
 
06:17:41.270 --> 06:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to go down to a couple
 
06:17:43.010 --> 06:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
paragraphs in deference to your request
 
06:17:44.750 --> 06:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
to not repeat
 
06:17:46.610 --> 06:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
first thing that struck me today and
 
06:17:48.770 --> 06:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
it's not all my testimony is the fact
 
06:17:50.090 --> 06:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
06:17:53.208 --> 06:17:53.218 align:start position:0%
wolf pack here today U.S term limits
 
06:17:55.368 --> 06:17:55.378 align:start position:0%
here today convention Estates here today
 
06:17:57.288 --> 06:17:57.298 align:start position:0%
we have people from all different
 
06:18:02.030 --> 06:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
political views testifying to you today
 
06:18:04.490 --> 06:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
say it we need this
 
06:18:06.410 --> 06:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
very interesting they're coming at it
 
06:18:07.788 --> 06:18:07.798 align:start position:0%
from all different directions and
 
06:18:09.170 --> 06:18:09.180 align:start position:0%
they're all coming to the same
 
06:18:09.180 --> 06:18:10.490 align:start position:0%
they're all coming to the same
conclusion

06:18:10.490 --> 06:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
conclusion
 
06:18:13.128 --> 06:18:13.138 align:start position:0%
I'm an engineer by train if I have
 
06:18:14.690 --> 06:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
people solve a problem from two
 
06:18:15.948 --> 06:18:15.958 align:start position:0%
different directions and they come to
 
06:18:17.810 --> 06:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
the same conclusion it's probably pretty
 
06:18:19.788 --> 06:18:19.798 align:start position:0%
damn good
 
06:18:22.010 --> 06:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
just adding one little note to the whole
 
06:18:24.410 --> 06:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
31 and a half that you have heard all
 
06:18:25.850 --> 06:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
day long
 
06:18:29.150 --> 06:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
last year we paid five percent of the
 
06:18:31.128 --> 06:18:31.138 align:start position:0%
national budget
 
06:18:32.868 --> 06:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
for interest
 
06:18:34.730 --> 06:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
at current interest rates four percent
 
06:18:36.530 --> 06:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
that's what t-bells are going you know
 
06:18:38.990 --> 06:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
some a little some above and below
 
06:18:43.548 --> 06:18:43.558 align:start position:0%
that's going to move to 18 very quickly
 
06:18:45.170 --> 06:18:45.180 align:start position:0%
could you imagine what you could do with
 
06:18:47.448 --> 06:18:47.458 align:start position:0%
1.2 trillion dollars if you weren't
 
06:18:52.010 --> 06:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:53.990 --> 06:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
the heart of the matter
 
06:18:56.150 --> 06:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
is the balance of power
 
06:18:57.708 --> 06:18:57.718 align:start position:0%
sorry it's going to be a little choppy
 
06:19:00.110 --> 06:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
because I'm skipping
 
06:19:02.570 --> 06:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
when the Articles of Confederation were
 
06:19:05.868 --> 06:19:05.878 align:start position:0%
developed you had about a 90 10 split of
 
06:19:08.510 --> 06:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
power 10 to the federal government 90 to
 
06:19:09.470 --> 06:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
the state
 
06:19:11.868 --> 06:19:11.878 align:start position:0%
Constitution was developed that
 
06:19:14.890 --> 06:19:14.900 align:start position:0%
rebalanced a bit 40 federal government
 
06:19:18.770 --> 06:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
60 State today
 
06:19:21.650 --> 06:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
I think you'd be hard-pressed to say 10
 
06:19:24.470 --> 06:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
is left in the state the federal
 
06:19:27.650 --> 06:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
government is now dominating States and
 
06:19:29.628 --> 06:19:29.638 align:start position:0%
they're doing it with money
 
06:19:32.030 --> 06:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
they're borrowing money to control
 
06:19:32.040 --> 06:19:33.288 align:start position:0%
they're borrowing money to control
States

06:19:33.288 --> 06:19:33.298 align:start position:0%
States
 
06:19:34.970 --> 06:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
you've all seen
 
06:19:37.368 --> 06:19:37.378 align:start position:0%
the funding that has come in it always
 
06:19:39.230 --> 06:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
comes in with strengths
 
06:19:41.390 --> 06:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
that's how they're doing it a Convention
 
06:19:43.850 --> 06:19:43.860 align:start position:0%
of States allows you
 
06:19:46.610 --> 06:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
to take that federal government and
 
06:19:48.948 --> 06:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
restrain them give them some guard reps
 
06:19:51.590 --> 06:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
keep them from doing that to you pull
 
06:19:53.628 --> 06:19:53.638 align:start position:0%
the power back to yourself get it back
 
06:19:56.690 --> 06:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
to a 50 50. something in that range
 
06:19:58.548 --> 06:19:58.558 align:start position:0%
that's the idea of the convention of
 
06:19:58.558 --> 06:19:59.448 align:start position:0%
that's the idea of the convention of
states

06:19:59.448 --> 06:19:59.458 align:start position:0%
states
 
06:20:02.090 --> 06:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
put the guard rails in place
 
06:20:04.010 --> 06:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
on the issue of term limits I just
 
06:20:05.990 --> 06:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
finished a book that
 
06:20:09.350 --> 06:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
really it's a story of Billy Bulger and
 
06:20:10.490 --> 06:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
Whitey Bulger
 
06:20:14.090 --> 06:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
but nested inside that story
 
06:20:17.510 --> 06:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
hour of Billy Bulger and how Billy
 
06:20:19.910 --> 06:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
Bulger over years and years and years
 
06:20:22.788 --> 06:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
and years accumulated that power and
 
06:20:25.250 --> 06:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
became an Unstoppable force in
 
06:20:28.490 --> 06:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts politics
 
06:20:31.548 --> 06:20:31.558 align:start position:0%
had there been term limits
 
06:20:32.990 --> 06:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think Billy would have ever
 
06:20:35.330 --> 06:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
gotten to where Billy got
 
06:20:37.010 --> 06:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
think about that
 
06:20:40.190 --> 06:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
turning over Congress turning over the
 
06:20:43.368 --> 06:20:43.378 align:start position:0%
Senate will stop the accumulation of
 
06:20:46.788 --> 06:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
power the most powerful people in both
 
06:20:49.850 --> 06:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
Chambers have been there for quite a
 
06:20:52.548 --> 06:20:52.558 align:start position:0%
while I'll leave you with that thought
 
06:20:55.970 --> 06:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
one last item on my thoughts
 
06:20:57.890 --> 06:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
we spoke about our children
 
06:21:00.830 --> 06:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
we have a state motto live free and die
 
06:21:03.590 --> 06:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
Congress has a motto live free and pay
 
06:21:03.600 --> 06:21:05.868 align:start position:0%
Congress has a motto live free and pay
later

06:21:05.868 --> 06:21:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:09.110 --> 06:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
I can't match Mike Farris and his army
 
06:21:11.628 --> 06:21:11.638 align:start position:0%
of grandkids I've got four
 
06:21:14.510 --> 06:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
but I have the same thoughts as him
 
06:21:18.048 --> 06:21:18.058 align:start position:0%
we cannot spend today and burden our
 
06:21:18.058 --> 06:21:19.128 align:start position:0%
we cannot spend today and burden our
children

06:21:19.128 --> 06:21:19.138 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:21:21.530 --> 06:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
with the shackles of debt they can never
 
06:21:24.770 --> 06:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
realize live free
 
06:21:26.868 --> 06:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
another book I read yes I read too much
 
06:21:28.730 --> 06:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
history I apologize
 
06:21:31.368 --> 06:21:31.378 align:start position:0%
it's a great book called American Rebels
 
06:21:34.490 --> 06:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
it's the story of the atoms Quincy and
 
06:21:36.230 --> 06:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
Hancock family
 
06:21:37.788 --> 06:21:37.798 align:start position:0%
and there's a thread that goes through
 
06:21:39.410 --> 06:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
that whole book
 
06:21:42.708 --> 06:21:42.718 align:start position:0%
and that is these were people of action
 
06:21:46.310 --> 06:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
they saw a problem they took action they
 
06:21:48.048 --> 06:21:48.058 align:start position:0%
solved the problem
 
06:21:49.548 --> 06:21:49.558 align:start position:0%
it took years
 
06:21:52.368 --> 06:21:52.378 align:start position:0%
took a lot of sweat Blood Sweat and
 
06:21:52.378 --> 06:21:53.270 align:start position:0%
took a lot of sweat Blood Sweat and
Tears

06:21:53.270 --> 06:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
Tears
 
06:21:55.010 --> 06:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
but they solved it
 
06:21:57.590 --> 06:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
it was a fellow named Joshua Quincy no
 
06:21:58.910 --> 06:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
one's probably ever really heard of
 
06:22:01.730 --> 06:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
Joshua Joshua was the Thomas Jefferson
 
06:22:03.590 --> 06:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
of that period
 
06:22:05.990 --> 06:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
before the Continental congresses Joshua
 
06:22:07.850 --> 06:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
went to every single state
 
06:22:10.250 --> 06:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
got them on board they weren't States
 
06:22:12.530 --> 06:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
sorry colonies at the time Joshua went
 
06:22:14.810 --> 06:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
to England he spent time with Ben
 
06:22:19.190 --> 06:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
Franklin Joshua died in 1775 coming back
 
06:22:22.190 --> 06:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
from England consumption so we lost a
 
06:22:23.330 --> 06:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
great man
 
06:22:26.330 --> 06:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
but most of the early writings were in
 
06:22:28.788 --> 06:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
Joshua Quincy's pet
 
06:22:30.470 --> 06:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
and he had a saying that I want to leave
 
06:22:32.750 --> 06:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
you with
 
06:22:35.030 --> 06:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
it is yourselves
 
06:22:38.030 --> 06:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
it is yourselves must save you
 
06:22:41.090 --> 06:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
and you are equal to the task
 
06:22:43.430 --> 06:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
I look at this committee and that's what
 
06:22:44.330 --> 06:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
I think
 
06:22:47.750 --> 06:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
it is up to you to save us by changing
 
06:22:50.448 --> 06:22:50.458 align:start position:0%
the direction of the federal government
 
06:22:52.850 --> 06:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
put the guard rails on them using
 
06:22:54.590 --> 06:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
article 5.
 
06:22:56.868 --> 06:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
and I think you're up to the task thank
 
06:22:56.878 --> 06:22:58.190 align:start position:0%
and I think you're up to the task thank
you

06:22:58.190 --> 06:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:23:02.810 --> 06:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:05.410 --> 06:23:05.420 align:start position:0%
and seeing
 
06:23:08.330 --> 06:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
Roosevelt Kerry has her hand up yes
 
06:23:10.430 --> 06:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
do you have a piece of paperwork you
 
06:23:12.590 --> 06:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
might want to submit for the record
 
06:23:14.510 --> 06:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
in your how about if I clean this up Can
 
06:23:16.730 --> 06:23:16.740 align:start position:0%
I submit it by email or I can use your
 
06:23:21.350 --> 06:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:24.830 --> 06:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:27.650 --> 06:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:31.730 --> 06:23:31.740 align:start position:0%
Joshua McAllister from Manchester
 
06:23:38.090 --> 06:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:40.610 --> 06:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
okay I don't know if his written
 
06:23:43.010 --> 06:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
testimony was dropped off or send
 
06:23:43.020 --> 06:23:45.470 align:start position:0%
testimony was dropped off or send
electronically

06:23:45.470 --> 06:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
06:23:48.110 --> 06:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
did I don't know if he said he had
 
06:23:50.030 --> 06:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
06:23:52.490 --> 06:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
um do you know if he
 
06:24:06.530 --> 06:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:09.470 --> 06:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
okay if you're in touch with him uh you
 
06:24:11.750 --> 06:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
can tell him he can email that to the
 
06:24:14.090 --> 06:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
committee to my attention and we'll get
 
06:24:18.048 --> 06:24:18.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:20.270 --> 06:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say if he was for or against
 
06:24:22.730 --> 06:24:22.740 align:start position:0%
the measure
 
06:24:28.490 --> 06:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:31.610 --> 06:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for hanging in uh Lisa you
 
06:24:33.288 --> 06:24:33.298 align:start position:0%
opposed the bill and you asked for three
 
06:24:33.298 --> 06:24:35.930 align:start position:0%
opposed the bill and you asked for three
minutes

06:24:35.930 --> 06:24:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:38.090 --> 06:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
and I again I called the bill it is a
 
06:24:54.770 --> 06:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:54.780 --> 06:24:55.970 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

06:24:55.970 --> 06:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:24:55.980 --> 06:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

06:24:56.820 --> 06:24:56.830 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:24:56.830 --> 06:24:57.530 align:start position:0%
okay
[Music]

06:24:57.530 --> 06:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:24:57.540 --> 06:24:58.548 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

06:24:58.548 --> 06:24:58.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:01.788 --> 06:25:01.798 align:start position:0%
it's my first time so bear with me
 
06:25:01.798 --> 06:25:02.628 align:start position:0%
it's my first time so bear with me
um

06:25:02.628 --> 06:25:02.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:04.128 --> 06:25:04.138 align:start position:0%
first of all I'd like to thank all of
 
06:25:05.810 --> 06:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
you for for being here I was very
 
06:25:08.330 --> 06:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
pleased to see so many people show up
 
06:25:09.410 --> 06:25:09.420 align:start position:0%
for this
 
06:25:12.770 --> 06:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
um like our my predecessor said we are
 
06:25:15.170 --> 06:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
all in this together
 
06:25:15.180 --> 06:25:16.070 align:start position:0%
all in this together
um

06:25:16.070 --> 06:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:19.430 --> 06:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
my big concern is
 
06:25:22.368 --> 06:25:22.378 align:start position:0%
if the convention of states is the way
 
06:25:23.628 --> 06:25:23.638 align:start position:0%
to go
 
06:25:26.990 --> 06:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
it does hold a potential for being very
 
06:25:28.910 --> 06:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
dangerous to our Constitution and our
 
06:25:28.920 --> 06:25:29.990 align:start position:0%
dangerous to our Constitution and our
country

06:25:29.990 --> 06:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
country
 
06:25:32.030 --> 06:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation is completely
 
06:25:34.190 --> 06:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
unnecessary I feel
 
06:25:37.190 --> 06:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
the for example the facts that term
 
06:25:39.650 --> 06:25:39.660 align:start position:0%
limits have not put anyone at an
 
06:25:41.390 --> 06:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
advantage except lobbyists when looking
 
06:25:45.708 --> 06:25:45.718 align:start position:0%
at term limits uh history in other
 
06:25:47.868 --> 06:25:47.878 align:start position:0%
states where they have been implemented
 
06:25:49.730 --> 06:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
new or elected officials are more
 
06:25:53.150 --> 06:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to be led or misled due to
 
06:25:54.890 --> 06:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
their lack of experience
 
06:25:57.890 --> 06:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
for perspective no one asks a lobbyist
 
06:25:59.690 --> 06:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
to be dismissed after two to eight years
 
06:26:02.510 --> 06:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
they only grow more experienced and they
 
06:26:04.788 --> 06:26:04.798 align:start position:0%
learn the ins and outs of the system and
 
06:26:06.770 --> 06:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
even developed the working relationships
 
06:26:09.530 --> 06:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
with long-term knowledgeable staffers as
 
06:26:12.830 --> 06:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
the lobbyists are there longer within
 
06:26:14.330 --> 06:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
the elected officials
 
06:26:17.150 --> 06:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
this gives them a much larger Advantage
 
06:26:19.490 --> 06:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
the frequent turnover of electric
 
06:26:22.128 --> 06:26:22.138 align:start position:0%
elected officials puts the elected
 
06:26:25.310 --> 06:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
officials at a considerable disadvantage
 
06:26:27.110 --> 06:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
term limits can prevent very good
 
06:26:29.750 --> 06:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
elected people from being reelected and
 
06:26:31.610 --> 06:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
keep them from gaining more insight and
 
06:26:33.170 --> 06:26:33.180 align:start position:0%
experience which is very
 
06:26:35.030 --> 06:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
counterproductive in turning the current
 
06:26:38.628 --> 06:26:38.638 align:start position:0%
situation around if that is the Hope
 
06:26:40.670 --> 06:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
in fact term limits already do exist
 
06:26:43.910 --> 06:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:46.190 --> 06:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
um furthermore to enact term limits when
 
06:26:47.570 --> 06:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
undermine the people's God give them a
 
06:26:49.850 --> 06:26:49.860 align:start position:0%
right to choose the representatives
 
06:26:52.850 --> 06:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
uh we should also be horrifically we
 
06:26:56.690 --> 06:26:56.700 align:start position:0%
should uh should we but should we were
 
06:26:58.788 --> 06:26:58.798 align:start position:0%
to open the convention of States we
 
06:27:01.310 --> 06:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
would get rid of our god-given rights
 
06:27:04.010 --> 06:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
recognized in our constitution this
 
06:27:05.628 --> 06:27:05.638 align:start position:0%
procedure is how the Articles of
 
06:27:07.730 --> 06:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
Confederation was replaced by our
 
06:27:10.430 --> 06:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
constitution there is a president's
 
06:27:13.190 --> 06:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
precedent here and therefore it could
 
06:27:14.390 --> 06:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
happen again
 
06:27:16.250 --> 06:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
please do not believe the rhetoric
 
06:27:18.770 --> 06:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
stating differently we could lose the
 
06:27:20.390 --> 06:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
reasons that being an American is
 
06:27:23.030 --> 06:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
wonderful and awesome we have rights
 
06:27:25.430 --> 06:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
given by God and no government officials
 
06:27:27.110 --> 06:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
can take these away
 
06:27:29.990 --> 06:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh take away these protections as long
 
06:27:32.448 --> 06:27:32.458 align:start position:0%
as we have the Constitution
 
06:27:34.910 --> 06:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
if the if the concern is about federal
 
06:27:37.010 --> 06:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
government having overreach and the
 
06:27:39.110 --> 06:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
federal government not following the
 
06:27:41.750 --> 06:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
current Constitution the states can use
 
06:27:44.810 --> 06:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
nullification to stop unconstitutional
 
06:27:47.330 --> 06:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
laws and honestly they are under
 
06:27:49.910 --> 06:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
obligation to do so
 
06:27:52.610 --> 06:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
protect their citizens nullification is
 
06:27:53.990 --> 06:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
a safe way to
 
06:27:56.570 --> 06:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
protect our rights keep our Constitution
 
06:27:58.850 --> 06:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
and it has been used multiple times in
 
06:28:00.770 --> 06:28:00.780 align:start position:0%
U.S history including in the past few
 
06:28:00.780 --> 06:28:01.910 align:start position:0%
U.S history including in the past few
years

06:28:01.910 --> 06:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:28:04.190 --> 06:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
if you like I can bring a few examples
 
06:28:07.128 --> 06:28:07.138 align:start position:0%
to you if you're interested and I can
 
06:28:09.830 --> 06:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
give you some information as to how to
 
06:28:12.470 --> 06:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
how the process proceeds
 
06:28:12.480 --> 06:28:13.310 align:start position:0%
how the process proceeds
um

06:28:13.310 --> 06:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:28:15.170 --> 06:28:15.180 align:start position:0%
you know if you are so willing to
 
06:28:17.150 --> 06:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
receive you know more information on
 
06:28:18.708 --> 06:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
that subject
 
06:28:21.770 --> 06:28:21.780 align:start position:0%
my main concern is
 
06:28:24.170 --> 06:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
I mean it's obvious
 
06:28:25.970 --> 06:28:25.980 align:start position:0%
to everyone
 
06:28:29.868 --> 06:28:29.878 align:start position:0%
that we need to change my concern is
 
06:28:29.878 --> 06:28:31.368 align:start position:0%
that we need to change my concern is
that

06:28:31.368 --> 06:28:31.378 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:28:31.378 --> 06:28:32.628 align:start position:0%
that
the

06:28:32.628 --> 06:28:32.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:28:36.350 --> 06:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
the COS opens up a lot of risk
 
06:28:38.930 --> 06:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
I believe the Nullification should be
 
06:28:42.110 --> 06:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
used first and foremost
 
06:28:44.628 --> 06:28:44.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that a COS may never never
 
06:28:47.690 --> 06:28:47.700 align:start position:0%
may never come to fruition I'm
 
06:28:50.448 --> 06:28:50.458 align:start position:0%
just a little bit wary of it
 
06:28:51.830 --> 06:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:28:54.230 --> 06:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
do you have written testimony copy that
 
06:28:55.788 --> 06:28:55.798 align:start position:0%
you'd like to
 
06:28:59.270 --> 06:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you I can give you my what I the
 
06:29:01.368 --> 06:29:01.378 align:start position:0%
thread but um and then I have those
 
06:29:03.170 --> 06:29:03.180 align:start position:0%

um
 
06:29:09.830 --> 06:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh well we do like to keep a folder of
 
06:29:11.570 --> 06:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
testimony if that if that's presentable
 
06:29:23.868 --> 06:29:23.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:25.548 --> 06:29:25.558 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your your time
 
06:29:28.670 --> 06:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:30.410 --> 06:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
Larry Gomes
 
06:29:35.690 --> 06:29:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:35.700 --> 06:29:42.288 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:29:42.288 --> 06:29:42.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:42.298 --> 06:29:43.250 align:start position:0%

today
um

06:30:01.788 --> 06:30:01.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:30:04.490 --> 06:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
miss Larry going resident of Stark and
 
06:30:07.548 --> 06:30:07.558 align:start position:0%
and over the last few years our family
 
06:30:10.548 --> 06:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
has been increasingly concerned about
 
06:30:13.368 --> 06:30:13.378 align:start position:0%
the runaway Federal deficit to the point
 
06:30:15.830 --> 06:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
we've been discussing this at
 
06:30:17.990 --> 06:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving you know and I'm not
 
06:30:19.610 --> 06:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
talking just the older members I'm
 
06:30:22.548 --> 06:30:22.558 align:start position:0%
talking to younger kids too
 
06:30:24.770 --> 06:30:24.780 align:start position:0%
um there is a lot of countries in the
 
06:30:27.770 --> 06:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
world where printing too much money has
 
06:30:30.830 --> 06:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
caused runaway inflation uh just to
 
06:30:33.890 --> 06:30:33.900 align:start position:0%
mention a few Argentina Venezuela and
 
06:30:33.900 --> 06:30:35.208 align:start position:0%
mention a few Argentina Venezuela and
Zimbabwe

06:30:35.208 --> 06:30:35.218 align:start position:0%
Zimbabwe
 
06:30:37.670 --> 06:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
and in all of these countries
 
06:30:39.470 --> 06:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
uncontrolled printing led to
 
06:30:39.480 --> 06:30:41.030 align:start position:0%
uncontrolled printing led to
hyperinflation

06:30:41.030 --> 06:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
hyperinflation
 
06:30:43.310 --> 06:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
which then resulted in the middle class
 
06:30:46.730 --> 06:30:46.740 align:start position:0%
being decimated by food shortages crime
 
06:30:49.010 --> 06:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
and economic depression
 
06:30:51.910 --> 06:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
think about this just 30 years ago
 
06:30:54.708 --> 06:30:54.718 align:start position:0%
Venezuela which has the largest oil
 
06:30:58.010 --> 06:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
reserves more than Saudi Arabia used to
 
06:31:00.590 --> 06:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
have a standard of living equal to the
 
06:31:04.368 --> 06:31:04.378 align:start position:0%
United States and now 9 out of 10 people
 
06:31:06.590 --> 06:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
cannot even feed themselves in that
 
06:31:08.208 --> 06:31:08.218 align:start position:0%
country and a lot of them are leaving
 
06:31:10.070 --> 06:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
the country
 
06:31:12.590 --> 06:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
you know and so we talk about this
 
06:31:15.230 --> 06:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
because could it happen to us and the
 
06:31:17.390 --> 06:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
answer is yes
 
06:31:17.400 --> 06:31:18.590 align:start position:0%
answer is yes
so

06:31:18.590 --> 06:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:31:21.470 --> 06:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
we had almost lost hope until I found
 
06:31:23.868 --> 06:31:23.878 align:start position:0%
out about the convention of States about
 
06:31:25.670 --> 06:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
a month and a half ago I didn't even
 
06:31:27.288 --> 06:31:27.298 align:start position:0%
know this existed
 
06:31:29.208 --> 06:31:29.218 align:start position:0%
and I started reading up what they
 
06:31:31.490 --> 06:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to do I read everything I could
 
06:31:34.610 --> 06:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
on Article 5 I watched eight hours of a
 
06:31:37.190 --> 06:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
mock convention that they put on in
 
06:31:39.470 --> 06:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
Virginia to show how the process would
 
06:31:44.030 --> 06:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
work and I am convinced that this is a
 
06:31:45.948 --> 06:31:45.958 align:start position:0%
solution that can work
 
06:31:48.770 --> 06:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
versus the other solution which I don't
 
06:31:50.570 --> 06:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
even want to imagine
 
06:31:54.530 --> 06:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
and so as you know 19 states have passed
 
06:31:58.310 --> 06:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
this resolution and I respectfully asked
 
06:32:00.830 --> 06:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
this committee to make the New Hampshire
 
06:32:04.548 --> 06:32:04.558 align:start position:0%
the 20th State to make this happen give
 
06:32:07.548 --> 06:32:07.558 align:start position:0%
it a chance let it go and see where it
 
06:32:09.470 --> 06:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
goes because
 
06:32:11.448 --> 06:32:11.458 align:start position:0%
the other solution is coming no matter
 
06:32:13.628 --> 06:32:13.638 align:start position:0%
whether we want it or not
 
06:32:17.448 --> 06:32:17.458 align:start position:0%
hyperinflation is here and it's coming
 
06:32:20.270 --> 06:32:20.280 align:start position:0%
so I just want to end with the framers
 
06:32:22.190 --> 06:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
knew one day the federal government
 
06:32:25.970 --> 06:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
would it overstep their bounds and they
 
06:32:28.788 --> 06:32:28.798 align:start position:0%
gave us this legal and peaceful way
 
06:32:31.610 --> 06:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
to reign in big government so I would
 
06:32:34.730 --> 06:32:34.740 align:start position:0%
sincerely ask that you join our family
 
06:32:37.310 --> 06:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
and the thousands of others who are part
 
06:32:38.990 --> 06:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
of this movement
 
06:32:42.110 --> 06:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
to make New Hampshire the 20th state to
 
06:32:44.208 --> 06:32:44.218 align:start position:0%
adopt this resolution thank you very
 
06:32:44.218 --> 06:32:46.430 align:start position:0%

me
 
06:34:47.810 --> 06:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
um a little bit of my background I don't
 
06:34:48.890 --> 06:34:48.900 align:start position:0%
think if I shared in a previous
 
06:34:50.750 --> 06:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
testimony but
 
06:34:53.090 --> 06:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
I used to fight that gentleman when he
 
06:34:55.070 --> 06:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
first started this I used to hand out
 
06:34:58.128 --> 06:34:58.138 align:start position:0%
this DVD produced by the John Birch
 
06:34:58.138 --> 06:34:59.330 align:start position:0%
this DVD produced by the John Birch
Society

06:34:59.330 --> 06:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
Society
 
06:35:04.628 --> 06:35:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:07.310 --> 06:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
they want you to be scared over the
 
06:35:07.320 --> 06:35:09.650 align:start position:0%
they want you to be scared over the
Constitution

06:35:09.650 --> 06:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
06:35:11.990 --> 06:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
initially I was
 
06:35:14.270 --> 06:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
until I did my own research
 
06:35:17.330 --> 06:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
it didn't take me very long to realize
 
06:35:21.288 --> 06:35:21.298 align:start position:0%
wow the framers were geniuses
 
06:35:22.910 --> 06:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
I never knew why they put the convention
 
06:35:25.610 --> 06:35:25.620 align:start position:0%
mode in Article 5 until I actually read
 
06:35:25.620 --> 06:35:27.470 align:start position:0%
mode in Article 5 until I actually read
why

06:35:27.470 --> 06:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
why
 
06:35:28.850 --> 06:35:28.860 align:start position:0%
funny what happens when you start doing
 
06:35:30.590 --> 06:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
some reading on your own
 
06:35:33.288 --> 06:35:33.298 align:start position:0%
I immediately realized
 
06:35:38.150 --> 06:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
wow this is the mechanism
 
06:35:40.548 --> 06:35:40.558 align:start position:0%
that we need to use
 
06:35:42.590 --> 06:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
and I called up the convention of States
 
06:35:44.448 --> 06:35:44.458 align:start position:0%
at that time and I apologize for
 
06:35:47.090 --> 06:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
opposing them in fact I handed out that
 
06:35:49.190 --> 06:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
DVD to the legislators in my state and I
 
06:35:51.110 --> 06:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
had to apologize for them because once I
 
06:35:52.730 --> 06:35:52.740 align:start position:0%
realized that the information contained
 
06:35:54.048 --> 06:35:54.058 align:start position:0%
in that DVD
 
06:35:56.330 --> 06:35:56.340 align:start position:0%
was nothing but lies
 
06:35:58.610 --> 06:35:58.620 align:start position:0%
I felt ashamed of myself for spreading
 
06:35:58.620 --> 06:36:00.288 align:start position:0%
I felt ashamed of myself for spreading
them

06:36:00.288 --> 06:36:00.298 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:36:03.410 --> 06:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
and I like to share something with you
 
06:36:05.448 --> 06:36:05.458 align:start position:0%
and I want to bring back the spirit of
 
06:36:07.368 --> 06:36:07.378 align:start position:0%
George Washington because this is
 
06:36:08.570 --> 06:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
nothing new
 
06:36:10.850 --> 06:36:10.860 align:start position:0%
this is a quote
 
06:36:13.070 --> 06:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
from the father of our country during
 
06:36:16.128 --> 06:36:16.138 align:start position:0%
the ratification of our constitution
 
06:36:19.548 --> 06:36:19.558 align:start position:0%
referring to the tactics used by the
 
06:36:22.670 --> 06:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
Anti-Federalists who were opposing their
 
06:36:25.250 --> 06:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
ratification of the U.S Constitution
 
06:36:27.708 --> 06:36:27.718 align:start position:0%
listen to our father
 
06:36:30.288 --> 06:36:30.298 align:start position:0%
the opponents I expected
 
06:36:32.810 --> 06:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
would Endeavor to give it an unfavorable
 
06:36:32.820 --> 06:36:34.850 align:start position:0%
would Endeavor to give it an unfavorable
complexion

06:36:34.850 --> 06:36:34.860 align:start position:0%
complexion
 
06:36:38.090 --> 06:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
with a view to bias the public mind
 
06:36:40.070 --> 06:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
this evidently is the case with the
 
06:36:42.230 --> 06:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
writers in opposition for their
 
06:36:44.208 --> 06:36:44.218 align:start position:0%
objections are better calculated to
 
06:36:46.070 --> 06:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
alarm the fears
 
06:36:48.048 --> 06:36:48.058 align:start position:0%
than to convince the Judgment of their
 
06:36:48.058 --> 06:36:49.250 align:start position:0%
than to convince the Judgment of their
readers

06:36:49.250 --> 06:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
readers
 
06:36:51.770 --> 06:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
they build them upon principles which do
 
06:36:54.470 --> 06:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
not exist in the Constitution
 
06:36:56.868 --> 06:36:56.878 align:start position:0%
which the known and literal sense of it
 
06:36:59.330 --> 06:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
does not support them in
 
06:37:01.910 --> 06:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
this too after being flatly told that
 
06:37:03.730 --> 06:37:03.740 align:start position:0%
they are treading on untenable ground
 
06:37:07.010 --> 06:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
and after an appeal has been made to the
 
06:37:10.010 --> 06:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
letter and spirit thereof for reproof
 
06:37:11.690 --> 06:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
and then as if the doctrine was
 
06:37:11.700 --> 06:37:13.310 align:start position:0%
and then as if the doctrine was
incontrovertible

06:37:13.310 --> 06:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
incontrovertible
 
06:37:15.948 --> 06:37:15.958 align:start position:0%
draw such consequences as are necessary
 
06:37:17.990 --> 06:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
to Rouse the apprehensions of the
 
06:37:20.270 --> 06:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
ignorance and unthinking
 
06:37:22.910 --> 06:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
it is not in the interest of the major
 
06:37:27.948 --> 06:37:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:31.010 --> 06:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
I say to you today that this tactic is
 
06:37:33.770 --> 06:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
exactly what is being used against this
 
06:37:33.780 --> 06:37:35.750 align:start position:0%
exactly what is being used against this
process

06:37:35.750 --> 06:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:37:38.770 --> 06:37:38.780 align:start position:0%
they stand on no constitutional ground
 
06:37:41.628 --> 06:37:41.638 align:start position:0%
this myth of a runaway convention is
 
06:37:44.390 --> 06:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
nothing but a fear tactic
 
06:37:46.850 --> 06:37:46.860 align:start position:0%
it is you cannot
 
06:37:49.788 --> 06:37:49.798 align:start position:0%
read article 5 you cannot look at our
 
06:37:49.798 --> 06:37:50.750 align:start position:0%
read article 5 you cannot look at our
history

06:37:50.750 --> 06:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
history
 
06:37:53.390 --> 06:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
and believe that stuff
 
06:37:55.490 --> 06:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
I heard one of your previous testimony
 
06:37:57.548 --> 06:37:57.558 align:start position:0%
testifiers say that James Madison
 
06:38:00.410 --> 06:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
trembled at the thought of this article
 
06:38:02.628 --> 06:38:02.638 align:start position:0%
5 convention
 
06:38:06.048 --> 06:38:06.058 align:start position:0%
the very letter they get that quote from
 
06:38:07.850 --> 06:38:07.860 align:start position:0%
he describes the two types of
 
06:38:07.860 --> 06:38:09.230 align:start position:0%
he describes the two types of
conventions

06:38:09.230 --> 06:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
conventions
 
06:38:11.510 --> 06:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
a constitutional convention
 
06:38:13.610 --> 06:38:13.620 align:start position:0%
which we talked about earlier which
 
06:38:16.190 --> 06:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
requires unanimous consent to call and
 
06:38:18.410 --> 06:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
which is what the Anti-Federalists were
 
06:38:22.788 --> 06:38:22.798 align:start position:0%
seeking at that time they wanted a redo
 
06:38:25.250 --> 06:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
he was not referring that's what he was
 
06:38:27.830 --> 06:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
referring to that convention not the
 
06:38:29.628 --> 06:38:29.638 align:start position:0%
two-thirds needed to propose an
 
06:38:31.490 --> 06:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
amendment convention that he supported
 
06:38:34.010 --> 06:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
all throughout his life he was a strong
 
06:38:36.530 --> 06:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
advocate for an article 5 convention
 
06:38:38.810 --> 06:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
in fact one of your own here at Hal
 
06:38:42.650 --> 06:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:44.390 --> 06:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
he wrote this in an article on the
 
06:38:48.770 --> 06:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
wearer's times July 22nd 2021
 
06:38:51.350 --> 06:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
he says James Madison who strongly
 
06:38:54.530 --> 06:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
opposed in Article 5 convention
 
06:38:57.048 --> 06:38:57.058 align:start position:0%
I can spend hours sharing with you
 
06:38:59.810 --> 06:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
quotes by Madison strongly advocating
 
06:39:01.850 --> 06:39:01.860 align:start position:0%
for an article 5 convention he believed
 
06:39:02.690 --> 06:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
in it
 
06:39:04.490 --> 06:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
and this guy runs something called Camp
 
06:39:04.500 --> 06:39:06.170 align:start position:0%
and this guy runs something called Camp
Constitution

06:39:06.170 --> 06:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
06:39:07.548 --> 06:39:07.558 align:start position:0%
it's unbelievable how they just say
 
06:39:10.850 --> 06:39:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:13.430 --> 06:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
all we have to do
 
06:39:15.770 --> 06:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
is read the debates during the
 
06:39:17.570 --> 06:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
convention when they drafted article 5.
 
06:39:20.270 --> 06:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
it's clear it's a limited convention
 
06:39:22.670 --> 06:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
is limited to what two-thirds of the
 
06:39:24.948 --> 06:39:24.958 align:start position:0%
states apply for
 
06:39:27.708 --> 06:39:27.718 align:start position:0%
they voted against giving Article 5 the
 
06:39:30.110 --> 06:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
powers of a constitutional convention
 
06:39:33.110 --> 06:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
the very first article 5 application
 
06:39:36.288 --> 06:39:36.298 align:start position:0%
submitted in 1789 by Virginia
 
06:39:38.690 --> 06:39:38.700 align:start position:0%
was for the Bill of Rights
 
06:39:41.330 --> 06:39:41.340 align:start position:0%
in the debates in Congress
 
06:39:44.510 --> 06:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
now this is very powerful
 
06:39:46.970 --> 06:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
over 50 members of the first Congress
 
06:39:49.490 --> 06:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
were either framers of our constitution
 
06:39:51.830 --> 06:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
or they were delegates to the state
 
06:39:55.310 --> 06:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
ratifying conventions that ratified the
 
06:39:57.470 --> 06:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
Constitution they well understood
 
06:40:00.288 --> 06:40:00.298 align:start position:0%
Article 5 and if when you read the
 
06:40:02.570 --> 06:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
debate in Congress every single person
 
06:40:05.510 --> 06:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
that spoke on the Virginia application
 
06:40:08.570 --> 06:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
knew we can't do anything until
 
06:40:11.570 --> 06:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
two-thirds apply for the same subject
 
06:40:15.048 --> 06:40:15.058 align:start position:0%
and then it's out of our hands
 
06:40:17.030 --> 06:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
and it's out of their hands because they
 
06:40:20.750 --> 06:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
knew Congress has no Authority in this
 
06:40:20.760 --> 06:40:21.830 align:start position:0%
knew Congress has no Authority in this
matter

06:40:21.830 --> 06:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
matter
 
06:40:24.288 --> 06:40:24.298 align:start position:0%
they don't choose the delegates they
 
06:40:27.110 --> 06:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
don't make the rules it all falls under
 
06:40:29.570 --> 06:40:29.580 align:start position:0%
the states that is why they gave us the
 
06:40:31.670 --> 06:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
Article 5 convention the very day on
 
06:40:34.070 --> 06:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
September 15th when there were voting on
 
06:40:36.350 --> 06:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
it and that's where George Mason stood
 
06:40:39.048 --> 06:40:39.058 align:start position:0%
up and I'm glad he did
 
06:40:41.990 --> 06:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
the way it was drafted still allowed
 
06:40:44.628 --> 06:40:44.638 align:start position:0%
Congress to propose the the Amendments
 
06:40:46.430 --> 06:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
that was applied for by the states and
 
06:40:49.070 --> 06:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
he said no we want them to have no
 
06:40:51.948 --> 06:40:51.958 align:start position:0%
Authority whatsoever in this process the
 
06:40:54.110 --> 06:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
convention is the institutional rival
 
06:40:57.110 --> 06:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
against Congress why in the world would
 
06:40:59.208 --> 06:40:59.218 align:start position:0%
the state legislatures want to give them
 
06:41:02.990 --> 06:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
any it makes absolutely no sense so this
 
06:41:06.350 --> 06:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
idea that we've heard in fact
 
06:41:08.628 --> 06:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
the previous testifier oh back to
 
06:41:11.690 --> 06:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
Madison I highly encourage you to read
 
06:41:13.850 --> 06:41:13.860 align:start position:0%
Federalist 38 because James Madison
 
06:41:16.610 --> 06:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
talks about that second convention that
 
06:41:19.850 --> 06:41:19.860 align:start position:0%
he trembled over and it's clear he's
 
06:41:21.288 --> 06:41:21.298 align:start position:0%
talking about a constitutional
 
06:41:23.208 --> 06:41:23.218 align:start position:0%
convention that the Anti-Federalists
 
06:41:24.948 --> 06:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
wanted it was a complete redo that's
 
06:41:26.810 --> 06:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
what he's referring to
 
06:41:28.610 --> 06:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
but a gentleman previously also
 
06:41:32.868 --> 06:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
mentioned a John Birch Society scholar
 
06:41:34.850 --> 06:41:34.860 align:start position:0%
I laugh at that by the name of Robert
 
06:41:34.860 --> 06:41:36.288 align:start position:0%
I laugh at that by the name of Robert
Brown

06:41:36.288 --> 06:41:36.298 align:start position:0%
Brown
 
06:41:38.750 --> 06:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
he goes and I think you have his
 
06:41:41.448 --> 06:41:41.458 align:start position:0%
testimony in fact I think um Mr Matthew
 
06:41:43.730 --> 06:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
Rhodes handed in his testimony looked
 
06:41:45.230 --> 06:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
very familiar to me
 
06:41:47.868 --> 06:41:47.878 align:start position:0%
in that testimony and what Mr Brown does
 
06:41:50.208 --> 06:41:50.218 align:start position:0%
is goes around the country
 
06:41:51.890 --> 06:41:51.900 align:start position:0%
he's offered a ten thousand dollar
 
06:41:51.900 --> 06:41:53.150 align:start position:0%
he's offered a ten thousand dollar
challenge

06:41:53.150 --> 06:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
06:41:55.850 --> 06:41:55.860 align:start position:0%
and this was his challenge
 
06:41:58.490 --> 06:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
find for me one delegate of the federal
 
06:42:03.048 --> 06:42:03.058 align:start position:0%
87 Federal Convention of 1787 that stood
 
06:42:04.670 --> 06:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
up and believed they had the authority
 
06:42:06.288 --> 06:42:06.298 align:start position:0%
to propose a new system of government
 
06:42:09.170 --> 06:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
and he says it doesn't exist it's on
 
06:42:11.750 --> 06:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
your sheet there you'll see this
 
06:42:14.690 --> 06:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
I've answered that challenge over five
 
06:42:19.430 --> 06:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
times he owes me ten thousand dollars
 
06:42:22.128 --> 06:42:22.138 align:start position:0%
I highly recommend I've got a YouTube
 
06:42:24.890 --> 06:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
channel just for that ten thousand
 
06:42:27.048 --> 06:42:27.058 align:start position:0%
dollars it's called All Things Article
 
06:42:30.110 --> 06:42:30.120 align:start position:0%
Five I encourage you please watch my
 
06:42:32.570 --> 06:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
five episodes so far
 
06:42:34.730 --> 06:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
requesting the ten thousand dollar
 
06:42:37.310 --> 06:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
payment because I overwhelmingly destroy
 
06:42:40.208 --> 06:42:40.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:44.030 --> 06:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
it's fear I'm tired of the fear this has
 
06:42:46.610 --> 06:42:46.620 align:start position:0%
been mentioned why hasn't this continued
 
06:42:48.110 --> 06:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
to get stopped
 
06:42:51.288 --> 06:42:51.298 align:start position:0%
here in this committee I don't know all
 
06:42:54.590 --> 06:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
I ask is we stop being fearful
 
06:42:58.190 --> 06:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:01.970 --> 06:43:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:04.730 --> 06:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
so we stop being afraid of what cannot
 
06:43:07.250 --> 06:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
happen cannot happen
 
06:43:11.330 --> 06:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
and be excited about what can happen
 
06:43:14.510 --> 06:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
imagine being able
 
06:43:18.170 --> 06:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
to partake and participate
 
06:43:20.990 --> 06:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
in a historic event
 
06:43:23.990 --> 06:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
where you get to propose
 
06:43:26.690 --> 06:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
an amendment that has been the desire of
 
06:43:29.330 --> 06:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
the American people for decades and an
 
06:43:31.970 --> 06:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
amendment that everybody wants except
 
06:43:36.470 --> 06:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:39.590 --> 06:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
terminals for congress simple
 
06:43:44.208 --> 06:43:44.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:46.850 --> 06:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
this is federalism
 
06:43:49.910 --> 06:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
this is the authority the framers gave
 
06:43:51.590 --> 06:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
to you
 
06:43:53.810 --> 06:43:53.820 align:start position:0%
now I just found this quote I'm going to
 
06:43:55.910 --> 06:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
read I'm going to close this because I
 
06:43:58.070 --> 06:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
was studying
 
06:44:00.350 --> 06:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
about this process back in the 90s
 
06:44:02.690 --> 06:44:02.700 align:start position:0%
termos is all the rage this is an
 
06:44:04.490 --> 06:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
article from 1994.
 
06:44:07.850 --> 06:44:07.860 align:start position:0%
if Congress is truly a representative
 
06:44:09.910 --> 06:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
body which is responsive to the people
 
06:44:12.650 --> 06:44:12.660 align:start position:0%
then it should propose an amendment to
 
06:44:14.990 --> 06:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
the Constitution limiting congressional
 
06:44:17.690 --> 06:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
terms and presented to the people for
 
06:44:17.700 --> 06:44:19.930 align:start position:0%
terms and presented to the people for
ratification

06:44:19.930 --> 06:44:19.940 align:start position:0%
ratification
 
06:44:23.208 --> 06:44:23.218 align:start position:0%
congress's refusal to do so is the best
 
06:44:25.788 --> 06:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
evidence that is not that it is not the
 
06:44:27.590 --> 06:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative body that the framers of
 
06:44:29.810 --> 06:44:29.820 align:start position:0%
the Constitution envisioned
 
06:44:31.670 --> 06:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
thus giving credence to the argument
 
06:44:33.310 --> 06:44:33.320 align:start position:0%
that the framers would support today's
 
06:44:35.690 --> 06:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
state-imposed Congressional term
 
06:44:35.700 --> 06:44:37.368 align:start position:0%
state-imposed Congressional term
limitation

06:44:37.368 --> 06:44:37.378 align:start position:0%
limitation
 
06:44:40.610 --> 06:44:40.620 align:start position:0%
it is a sad fact that if the states are
 
06:44:42.470 --> 06:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
not allowed to impose Congressional term
 
06:44:46.010 --> 06:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
limits Congress never will in spite of
 
06:44:48.490 --> 06:44:48.500 align:start position:0%
the will of the people the supposed
 
06:44:52.850 --> 06:44:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:55.368 --> 06:44:55.378 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
06:44:55.378 --> 06:44:56.930 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
this

06:44:56.930 --> 06:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:45:00.590 --> 06:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
process is because the reason we're here
 
06:45:03.170 --> 06:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
today is because Congress is
 
06:45:07.070 --> 06:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
unresponsive to the American people
 
06:45:09.770 --> 06:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
these reforms are not going to come from
 
06:45:09.780 --> 06:45:10.970 align:start position:0%
these reforms are not going to come from
Congress

06:45:10.970 --> 06:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
Congress
 
06:45:13.548 --> 06:45:13.558 align:start position:0%
we're up to what 17 amendments
 
06:45:16.010 --> 06:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
already in three weeks in this session
 
06:45:18.110 --> 06:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
in Congress and some of these are really
 
06:45:20.510 --> 06:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
good amendments but they're not going to
 
06:45:22.070 --> 06:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
see the light of day
 
06:45:24.590 --> 06:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
unless you step up
 
06:45:26.690 --> 06:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
and put pressure
 
06:45:31.010 --> 06:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:33.048 --> 06:45:33.058 align:start position:0%
they will start getting in line because
 
06:45:35.270 --> 06:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
they don't want you to do this
 
06:45:38.930 --> 06:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
they fear you they fear your power
 
06:45:41.868 --> 06:45:41.878 align:start position:0%
and that is why we are seeking your
 
06:45:41.878 --> 06:45:43.610 align:start position:0%
and that is why we are seeking your
support

06:45:43.610 --> 06:45:43.620 align:start position:0%
support
 
06:45:46.730 --> 06:45:46.740 align:start position:0%
all of you I would love to see unanimous
 
06:45:49.010 --> 06:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
consent here
 
06:45:54.110 --> 06:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
the vote ought to pass on hcr1
 
06:45:56.570 --> 06:45:56.580 align:start position:0%
please the American people the people of
 
06:45:58.430 --> 06:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and New Hampshire in my
 
06:46:00.590 --> 06:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
previous testimony should be leading the
 
06:46:03.530 --> 06:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
charge because you have the experience
 
06:46:06.590 --> 06:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire you sent delegates
 
06:46:09.110 --> 06:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
in 2017 to draft the rules for an
 
06:46:11.570 --> 06:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention you have had the
 
06:46:13.250 --> 06:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
most conventions for proposing
 
06:46:15.590 --> 06:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
amendments to your state constitution
 
06:46:17.990 --> 06:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
proposing over 200 amendments to your
 
06:46:19.910 --> 06:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
own Constitution
 
06:46:22.430 --> 06:46:22.440 align:start position:0%

06:46:24.650 --> 06:46:24.660 align:start position:0%

this process do not let the fear-mongers
 
06:46:35.330 --> 06:46:35.340 align:start position:0%
influence your decision on this
 
06:46:37.788 --> 06:46:37.798 align:start position:0%
I close but I just want to thank you for
