00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
we will begin our committee meeting with
 
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 align:start position:0%

hearing is not open and I would like to
 
00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 align:start position:0%
uh say that right now uh chairman Vose
 
00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
is in the Senate giving a a testimony so
 
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
he'll be back shortly in the interim I'd
 
00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
like to introduce uh Senator avar to
 
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate Bill 303 thank you Mr
 
00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 align:start position:0%
chairman and chairman committee uh uh
 
00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 align:start position:0%
and thanks to the committee I'm Senator
 
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
avard District 12 and uh I am the prime
 
00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill and it was at the
 
00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 align:start position:0%
request of the Department of energy and
 
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm going to ask you to treat me
 
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
nice because I got your chairman in my
 
00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 align:start position:0%
committee right now
 
00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
so anyway uh yeah I'm the prime sponsor
 
00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
of this bill and basically the bill adds
 
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 align:start position:0%
uh battery storage projects to the use
 
00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
of renewable energy fund it deletes
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
required re renewable energy generation
 
00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
incentive programs and authorizes a
 
00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
political subdivision incentive rebates
 
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
and Grant programs using this fund this
 
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 align:start position:0%
bill also modifies reporting date by the
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
department of energy concerning the
 
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund and again like I
 
00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
said it's at the request of the
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
department who is here also I believe to
 
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
answer some really technical questions
 
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 align:start position:0%
if you have them but uh so this bill was
 
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
um it makes changes on how the energy uh
 
00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund is
 
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
administered to better align with its
 
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
current happening in the energy sector
 
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
the re renewable energy fund is funded
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
through alternative compant payments
 
00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
made by electrical distribution
 
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
utilities and competitive suppliers who
 
00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 align:start position:0%
cannot acquire enough renewable energy
 
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
certificates to comply with state law so
 
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
the department then uses These funds to
 
00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 align:start position:0%
provide grants and rebates to renewable
 
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
energy projects that generate more
 
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates in the
 
00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 align:start position:0%
future needless to say that the energy
 
00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
sector is moving by Leaps and Bounds and
 
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
the state program needs to be able to
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
keep up with the market changes in order
 
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the limited State funds
 
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
are making the difference in these
 
00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 align:start position:0%
projects happening rather than just
 
00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
subsidizing projects that are happening
 
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
anyway perhaps the most recent uh
 
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps most importantly uh this bill
 
00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 align:start position:0%
directs the department to establish
 
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
programs specifically for political
 
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
subdivisions this will help our cities
 
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
our towns our counties to reduce their
 
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 align:start position:0%
energy costs by reducing pressure on
 
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.550 align:start position:0%
energy costs by reducing pressure on
property

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
tax Senate energy and uh recommends the
 
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
passage of by four to zero in the full
 
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
Senate passed on this on a voice Voice
 
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
vote and I hope my friends here in the
 
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
the house will vote the same way so if
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
you have some light questions I'd be
 
00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
happy to answer other than that I got to
 
00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
get back the committee thank you Senator
 
00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
does anyone have a burning question for
 
00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 align:start position:0%
the senator so we can get out of here
 
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
quickly represent K thank you thank you
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
Mr acting chair and this is a quick
 
00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 align:start position:0%
question I mean
 
00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:02.919 align:start position:0%
uh it says in the analysis that it adds
 
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
battery storage projects that's great I
 
00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 align:start position:0%
just don't see it in the actual bill as
 
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
as as it come to us it looks like it
 
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
took the battery storage language out
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
when when it was amended but so I mean
 
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
just could you clarify that for us like
 
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.360 align:start position:0%
where I cannot but I'm sure the
 
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:28.759 align:start position:0%
yeah okay yeah perhaps we can the next
 
00:07:30.869 --> 00:07:30.879 align:start position:0%
speaker might be able to to clarify that
 
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:32.120 align:start position:0%
representative Corman do you have
 
00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 align:start position:0%
question for the senator I had the same
 
00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:35.879 align:start position:0%
question as representative Kaplan great
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
mind stick
 
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
aik seeing no other questions seeing no
 
00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:42.879 align:start position:0%
other questions thank you Senator I need
 
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
I know you need to get back so thank you
 
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
you do yeah I'm
 
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm sorry we want to let you go
 
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
Senator I know you have stuff to do um
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
my question was around uh whether there
 
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
was any discussion in the Senate on this
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
bill about the change that cuts
 
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
generation from support under the RF
 
00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
funds was was it discussed what kind of
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
impact there would be if we were no
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
longer supporting um renewable
 
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:10.120 align:start position:0%
generation projects because that was you
 
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
know where it was focused before and
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
this kind of changes that Focus I think
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
the emphasis is is to uh basically fund
 
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
new projects and not funds that are
 
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
already existing and I think that's
 
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
that's where the emphasis is on this
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
bill okay thanks yeah with that
 
00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:29.919 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas you have a burning
 
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
question for the senator I'm sorry do
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%

the department can actually speak to
 
00:09:03.069 --> 00:09:03.079 align:start position:0%

around when alternative compliance
 
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
payments were made um this uh
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
inadvertently short changed the time
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
that staff have to actually review those
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
payments as they come in to ensure that
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
they're actually the correct amount that
 
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
should be paid um so this just by
 
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
reverting it uh pushing it back a month
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
from October to November um restores
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
that initial timeline um that was
 
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:26.680 align:start position:0%
contemplated it just didn't happen to
 
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
get caught in House Bill 2 uh section
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
two of the bill um makes two changes um
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
the uh afor mentioned from uh
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative uh Wendy Thomas uh
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
regarding uh modifying and existing uh
 
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
programs or opportunities um basically
 
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:47.240 align:start position:0%
gives us the authority um the the
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
previous process um had been uh done
 
00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
through a pu docket process um this
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
would give the department the ability to
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
change and modify programs obviously
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
including stakeholder input as as part
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
of that process
 
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
um to be able to make those sort of
 
00:11:06.509 --> 00:11:06.519 align:start position:0%
minor tweaks as as um uh the situation
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
dictates the second section the second
 
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
piece of of section two 19 lines 19
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
through 24 um is the reference to the
 
00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
municipal program that Senator avart
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
spoke to so this is a specific direction
 
00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
to the department to create that uh
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
program for municip or for political
 
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
subdivisions so cities towns counties
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
Etc um we have found um through process
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
with federal funds that there's a
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of demand for solar in
 
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
particular um from municipalities but
 
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
the current program structure does not
 
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:43.240 align:start position:0%
allow um does not provide enough funding
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
in order for those programs for those
 
00:11:46.629 --> 00:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
projects often to get off the ground so
 
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
this would allow us basically a specific
 
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
carve out for um political
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
subdivisions uh section three is just a
 
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.069 align:start position:0%
subdivisions uh section three is just a
cleanup

00:11:57.069 --> 00:11:57.079 align:start position:0%
cleanup
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm sorry I'm skipping section I'm
 
00:12:01.949 --> 00:12:01.959 align:start position:0%
sorry Section 3 Roman X as well as
 
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
section 4 um repeals the statutory
 
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:07.240 align:start position:0%
requirement for the residential uh
 
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
rebate program um and this is not
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
because the department doesn't want to
 
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
offer residential rebate programs it's
 
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
that the statutory construction is
 
00:12:19.189 --> 00:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
particularly uh strict um in that it
 
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:21.160 align:start position:0%
requires us to give a rebate to anybody
 
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
who's had a solar array that's been
 
00:12:26.189 --> 00:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
installed uh since 2008 so this array
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
could have been put in place in 2010 and
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
then um they could come in and get a
 
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
rebate if they haven't already gotten
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
one um the department is committed to um
 
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
reviewing a uh uh uh
 
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
reviewing uh a new m a new residential
 
00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:45.959 align:start position:0%
program in the Solar area essentially we
 
00:12:48.829 --> 00:12:48.839 align:start position:0%
uh the existing program
 
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
um uh has been um trying to think of how
 
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
to phrase this I should say as as part
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
of this we have done a public uh
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
stakeholder um in session um back in the
 
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
fall reviewing the comments one of the
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
con common points was that this
 
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
residential rebate program is not
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
functioning as though as it should
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
essentially it is just serving to
 
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
subsidize uh solar projects would have
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
happened otherwise rather than actually
 
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
incenting new ones from
 
00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
happening um so as part of that process
 
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
um we of course will engage with other
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to figure out what that
 
00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:23.839 align:start position:0%
right program design looks like um in
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
order to be able to provide those uh
 
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
rebates to um solar projects that might
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
actually make a difference rather than
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
ended up just subsidizing into existing
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
ones um section four Roman 11 um is just
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
a cleanup um of the existing statute
 
00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:42.519 align:start position:0%
just retaining the um direction that we
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
do the program every year and then
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
section five is the effective date um
 
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
there was a little bit of confusion um
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
regarding battery storage it was in the
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
original bills introduced by the Senate
 
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
the amended analysis did not capture
 
00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:57.079 align:start position:0%
that change in the amendment um so
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
that's why you still see that reference
 
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
to batter storage there it was removed
 
00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
by the Senate um based on comments from
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
uh that were heard in the Senate
 
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
hearing uh however I do want to note
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
that the fiscal note um is still
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
accurate for the bill um with the
 
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
exception of any of the references to
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
battery storage are are no longer there
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
so with that I am happy to take
 
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr Elliott I might
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
make mention before we get into
 
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
questions um congratulations on taking
 
00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:27.959 align:start position:0%
over uh we understand that Mr Griffin
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
Roberge is moving on uh we thank him for
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
his uh being here all all this time and
 
00:14:35.949 --> 00:14:35.959 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking over as now so I'm
 
00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
sure U uh uh you both will be doing just
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
fine I uh we're it's a loss for the
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
department but um I can't say uh you
 
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:47.560 align:start position:0%
know we're we're very happy for him as
 
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
much as we're going to give him a hard
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
time about it very good okay uh
 
00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:53.720 align:start position:0%
representative rolds
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman uh well
 
00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
particularly since the prime sponsor
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
pointed to you uh could you Enlighten us
 
00:15:05.949 --> 00:15:05.959 align:start position:0%
on the uh Senate's thinking and the
 
00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
Department's current
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
thinking uh in respect to the removal of
 
00:15:14.749 --> 00:15:14.759 align:start position:0%
references to battery storage from this
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
bill I mean uh as probably the next
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
testifiers you know
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
testimony describes in great detail
 
00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
battery storage is obviously an
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
important and
 
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
emerging piece of uh particularly the
 
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
efficacy of Renewables and
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
so you know are the programs are the
 
00:15:39.749 --> 00:15:39.759 align:start position:0%
programs you envision now going to
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
support um you know integrated solar and
 
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
battery storage or or what sure thank
 
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
you for the question so this came up
 
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
during this as you as you mentioned
 
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
during the um uh during the Senate
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
hearing um about a question about
 
00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not battery storage in itself
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
actually generates energy certificates
 
00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
um yes uh which it does not um so the uh
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
the question that was raised by some of
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
the uh testifiers during the Senate
 
00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
hearing what had pointed that out and
 
00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
said these don't generate wrecks the
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
underlying premise of the renewable
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
energy fund is to incent uh
 
00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
new um sources of generation that
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
produce recck so in theory right it
 
00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
should be a
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
self-fulfilling uh uh cycle of which
 
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
there are not enough wrecks these wrecks
 
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
go to to um fun F projects that then
 
00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
generate wrecks in theory in the future
 
00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:33.959 align:start position:0%
fewer wrecks are then needed so
 
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance would go down and
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
sort of a continuing cycle like that um
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
as part of that process right you would
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
have to be able to generate those wrecks
 
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
this um battery storage in in itself
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
does not generate wrecks because it is
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
just either taking electrons either Off
 
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
the Grid or behind the meter usage um
 
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
from an existing uh generation which
 
00:16:55.629 --> 00:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
then is then used by the consumer and
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually go out onto the grid um
 
00:16:59.949 --> 00:16:59.959 align:start position:0%
so there was that that question about
 
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not it actually um generated
 
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
Rex and therefore would be a appropriate
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
use of the renewable energy fund I will
 
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
say during our stakeholder sessions uh
 
00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:12.039 align:start position:0%
we did ask the question uh a number of
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
folks uh who commented responded
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
positively that yes a battery incentive
 
00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:19.240 align:start position:0%
program would be good um the uh the
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
testimony in the Senate was limited to
 
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
um individuals taking issue with it um
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
rather than being in support of
 
00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
ahead well thank you for that response I
 
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:39.640 align:start position:0%
guess in followup my my question I mean
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
obviously batteries don't generate any
 
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
electricity but as I stated in my
 
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
opening question batteries increase the
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
efficacy and the value of renewable
 
00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.630 align:start position:0%
efficacy and the value of renewable
energy

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
systems so I I think that distinction
 
00:17:58.029 --> 00:17:58.039 align:start position:0%
and the the Senate doing what they did
 
00:18:00.029 --> 00:18:00.039 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
kind of myopic uh so I'll ask you now um
 
00:18:06.909 --> 00:18:06.919 align:start position:0%
you know I'm I'm gratified that at
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
least uh remaining language in the bill
 
00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.710 align:start position:0%
least uh remaining language in the bill
refers

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:11.720 align:start position:0%
refers
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
to renewable thermal and electric energy
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
projects for political subdivisions is
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
it the
 
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.510 align:start position:0%
it the
Department's

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
Department's
 
00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
position uh
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
or does the department consider battery
 
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.029 align:start position:0%
or does the department consider battery
storage

00:18:30.029 --> 00:18:30.039 align:start position:0%
storage
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
to potentially
 
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
be a
 
00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.270 align:start position:0%
be a
valuable

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
valuable
 
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
component of renewable energy systems
 
00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
that could be supported by the renewable
 
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.990 align:start position:0%
that could be supported by the renewable
energy

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
fund I would I would answer that as a
 
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
qualified yes um there is a policy
 
00:18:51.149 --> 00:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
decision to be made there about whether
 
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
or not the renewable energy fund should
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
be used to um provide funding to
 
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
projects that don't in and of themselves
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
generate wrecks um that is policy
 
00:19:01.149 --> 00:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
decision that the legislature can make
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:09.640 align:start position:0%
so represent
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you um question on the
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
topic of battery storage if make make
 
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
sure if I'm following this correctly
 
00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:19.039 align:start position:0%
then what you're saying is that most
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
battery storage if not all is associated
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
with renewable energy projects so a wind
 
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:25.720 align:start position:0%
project the solar project for example
 
00:19:28.149 --> 00:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
produce uh renewable energy and they
 
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
receive recks for that now those recks
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
are either sold to a um one of the
 
00:19:35.789 --> 00:19:35.799 align:start position:0%
utilities or one of the electric
 
00:19:38.909 --> 00:19:38.919 align:start position:0%
providers or they uh you know those
 
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
providers provide alternate compliance
 
00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
payments instead but but they're already
 
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:44.200 align:start position:0%
that electricity that's produced has
 
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
already been awarded reck now when it
 
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
goes into battery storage it simply sits
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
there and then some hours later it gets
 
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
re re-released back to the grid it
 
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't produce any more electricity so
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
paying question coming please okay this
 
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
is what I'm saying the question's right
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
here paying recks to battery storage
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
would appear to be paying double Wrecks
 
00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
for the same amount of electricity once
 
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
when it's produced and a second time
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
when it's released from Storage is that
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
correct that that would be correct if we
 
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
were awarding Rex for uh electricity
 
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
that was discharged from batteries
 
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
however that's that is not contemplated
 
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
in this bill well that's what was
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
changed in the bill by the said uh no
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
that was that was wasn't part of the
 
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
bill as originally introduced but um was
 
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
the question that the policy question of
 
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not renewable energy funds
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
should be used to provide incentives for
 
00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
battery storage all right followup well
 
00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
I thought you had to follow up with the
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
second question but ahead well I'll make
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
this one real quick um you mentioned the
 
00:20:45.789 --> 00:20:45.799 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments the goal
 
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
of the original program was that we want
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
to produce more renewable energy so a
 
00:20:52.029 --> 00:20:52.039 align:start position:0%
long-term goal would be to see
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments go to
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
zero so all of the money from the wreck
 
00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
all the all that money is being produced
 
00:20:59.310 --> 00:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
is going to produce more renewable
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
energy how where will we add in that
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
goal of getting of making it so we don't
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
have alternate compliance payments um
 
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
that is an excellent question it is one
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
that is often um impacted by policy
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
decisions in other states um within the
 
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
uh ISO New England region the Rex can uh
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
be traded interchangeably um what counts
 
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
as a class one here is a different class
 
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts is a different class in
 
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Etc um there other states
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
have different requirements in terms of
 
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
what can be settled what of Rex um
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
there's a if you look at our annual
 
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
report there's a very complicated chart
 
00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
that sort of shows all the overlapping
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
what counts as what where in New England
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
um but that being said if New Hampshire
 
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
were sort of an isolated bu in of itself
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
and those wrecks did not go anywhere
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
else right you would have that sort of
 
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
mechanism um that would function in that
 
00:21:50.029 --> 00:21:50.039 align:start position:0%
way um but there are outside factors
 
00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
right there are policy decisions made by
 
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
other states that then impact what the
 
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
wreck Market looks like so just by New
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and of itself um can't
 
00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.390 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and of itself um can't
necessarily

00:21:59.390 --> 00:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
um uh that sort of that envisioned
 
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
process um is impacted by outside
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
factors that are beyond the policy
 
00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire begee thank you Mr acting
 
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Mr Elliott for
 
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so what I see in
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
the amendment before us um is a couple
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
of changes that are called out by the
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
analysis and then the first one about
 
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
batter storage actually no longer is
 
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
modified by the existing Amendment um
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
what I see is that we are saying that
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
the renewable generation incentive
 
00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
programs as they currently exist would
 
00:22:43.789 --> 00:22:43.799 align:start position:0%
go away and they would be replaced with
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
programs that would be um designed by
 
00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:50.679 align:start position:0%
the department of energy to support
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities and political
 
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
subdivisions um in adopting renewable
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
energy projects would that be a safe
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
analysis um no so we are not undermining
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
any of the the current programs that
 
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
exist with the exception of repealing
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
the specific residential solar program
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
due to the efficacy issues that I
 
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier but the with the
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
desire and the goal and the intention of
 
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
the department is to replace it with
 
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
something better after going through a
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
robust stakeholder process but the
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
existing programs that we offer for
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
example um the um uh non-residential um
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
competitive grant program uh the uh low
 
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:32.200 align:start position:0%
moderate income uh solar grant program
 
00:23:36.029 --> 00:23:36.039 align:start position:0%
the commercial uh solar rebate the
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
commercial wood re uh wood pellet rebate
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
as well as the residential wood wood
 
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
pellet rebate um would remain unchanged
 
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
okay so I have a follow-up so first of
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
all I would like us to establish how
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
much money is in the RF in any given
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
year so we can have an idea of how much
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
money we're talking about and then I
 
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
have a followup from there sure um I
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
would need to look back at our latest
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds report um to to get the
 
00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
exact figure as of where we sit right
 
00:24:06.669 --> 00:24:06.679 align:start position:0%
now um as well as check with our
 
00:24:08.669 --> 00:24:08.679 align:start position:0%
business office as to an exact balance
 
00:24:12.029 --> 00:24:12.039 align:start position:0%
okay um we ACP Revenue sort of varies
 
00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:13.720 align:start position:0%
from year to year depending on the the
 
00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:15.880 align:start position:0%
variety of factors um that I said in in
 
00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
response to representative Harrington's
 
00:24:17.919 --> 00:24:18.830 align:start position:0%
response to representative Harrington's
um

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
question um last year we received I'm
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
trying to recall off the top of my head
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
I think it was about 7ish million dollar
 
00:24:29.549 --> 00:24:29.559 align:start position:0%
in ACP revenues um so far this year has
 
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
been committed uh $4 million uh in
 
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
programs um part of it was uh
 
00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:39.799 align:start position:0%
contemplated of looking at um these
 
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
statutes and bringing this bill forward
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
engaging those stakeholder conversations
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that the programs that
 
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
we have are effective they're working
 
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
the way that they're intended and
 
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
they're actually beneficial to folks you
 
00:24:52.669 --> 00:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
know it would be um you know wouldn't
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
serve the the people of the State of New
 
00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if we came up with programs
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
that nobody wanted them right um so we
 
00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that those dollars are
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
being spent in the most effective way
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
possible okay and then can we uh before
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
we get to your second follow up can I go
 
00:25:08.389 --> 00:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
to representative months first then we
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
can we can come come back to
 
00:25:13.149 --> 00:25:13.159 align:start position:0%
you all right you're off the hook I'd
 
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
like to give the representative a chance
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
here go ahead than thank you Mr chair um
 
00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:20.200 align:start position:0%
and my apologies for arriving late and
 
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:21.640 align:start position:0%
if I'm asking a question that was
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
already answered uh my apologies as well
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um you
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
know SE section four eliminates um four
 
00:25:33.149 --> 00:25:33.159 align:start position:0%
or five very
 
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
specific um sections in statute
 
00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
currently um can you explain why that's
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
necessary sure um the uh program in
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
question is the residential program the
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
statute itself is is very um strictly
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
constructed in to the point of where the
 
00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
department is required to offer a rebate
 
00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
to any uh residential solar system
 
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
that's been installed since 2008 that
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
has provided has not received a rebate
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
So in theory you could have which is the
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
example um I mentioned earlier you could
 
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
have somebody who's installed a solar
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
array in 2010 come in and ask for $1,000
 
00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:16.039 align:start position:0%
rebate um we did conduct an initial
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
stakeholder session uh requesting
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
written comments in the fall um the
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
common Point among all of them was that
 
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
this current program is not functioning
 
00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh well or as intended uh so so with the
 
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
strict statutory
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
construction that's outlined uh
 
00:26:34.389 --> 00:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
currently in statute doesn't give us the
 
00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
flexibility to make it for example means
 
00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:38.559 align:start position:0%
test it or to Target it to certain areas
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
or do sort of all those S programmatic
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
changes um that would make it a more
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
effective program um that being said the
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
department is is committed to coming up
 
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
with a replacement for this program that
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
we would um put into place obviously
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
after stakeholder input and things like
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
that um to make sure that the program
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
that we're designing is actually um
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
doing what is intended to do rather than
 
00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
just what you know we on the inside
 
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
think would be effective but talking to
 
00:27:06.669 --> 00:27:06.679 align:start position:0%
those folks out in the field follow
 
00:27:06.679 --> 00:27:07.710 align:start position:0%
those folks out in the field follow
follow

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
up so why would we eliminate something
 
00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
before we have a replacement uh
 
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
identified um the program without the
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
the remove or I say without this change
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
we would continue having to basically
 
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
operate the program as is and there's a
 
00:27:26.669 --> 00:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
question about whether or not that is
 
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
the best use of money in the RF to
 
00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
continue spending on a program that we
 
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
effective representative mcke as you can
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
have the final
 
00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:42.440 align:start position:0%
question thanks um I think there was a
 
00:27:45.389 --> 00:27:45.399 align:start position:0%
hand up over there too but um so my
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
question is around our we don't seem to
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
have a lot of information around behind
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
the meter solar and it seems like those
 
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
individual solar installations actually
 
00:27:57.549 --> 00:27:57.559 align:start position:0%
are having having an impact uh on demand
 
00:27:59.230 --> 00:27:59.240 align:start position:0%
it may be the place where there's the
 
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
widest spread adoption for the way our
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
policies have been structured in the
 
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
state so do we have any information
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
about about um the the current impact of
 
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
behind the meter solar which I think is
 
00:28:15.509 --> 00:28:15.519 align:start position:0%
kind of elusive in terms of the the
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
numbers that we look at thank you for
 
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:19.240 align:start position:0%
the question so part of it is a bit
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
tricky because it is all happening
 
00:28:23.549 --> 00:28:23.559 align:start position:0%
behind the meter and the the grid as a
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh and in llarge doesn't see it because
 
00:28:27.669 --> 00:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
it it's not the only I should say the
 
00:28:29.549 --> 00:28:29.559 align:start position:0%
only way that that it's seen by the grid
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
as as a as a larger entity is by a
 
00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
reduction in demand um and um I'm sure
 
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
has been mentioned multiple times in
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
this committee the ice of New England
 
00:28:42.269 --> 00:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
app has the great um uh demand curve for
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
all of New England you can see that it
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
sort of comes up in the morning and then
 
00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919 align:start position:0%
there's a drop off in the middle of the
 
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
day and then there's sort of a spe steep
 
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
steep Spike as folks are getting home
 
00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
and as the sun is getting down um but in
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
terms of of that that generation or that
 
00:28:59.789 --> 00:28:59.799 align:start position:0%
removal of the demand is really
 
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
dependent on those individual homeowners
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
depending on what they're doing what
 
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
they're doing at those times as well as
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
whether conditions and variety of other
 
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
other factors yeah I I get all that I I
 
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
guess it's it's hard for us to
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
understand if we're using the RF in the
 
00:29:15.509 --> 00:29:15.519 align:start position:0%
correct way or designing the right
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
programs if we don't have that full
 
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
picture if if you could if your agency
 
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
could try and develop that for us so we
 
00:29:25.149 --> 00:29:25.159 align:start position:0%
had a better understanding of where we
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
are saving currently in the addition of
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
renewable generation then maybe we would
 
00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
be able to design a program that really
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
got us where we want to go faster and
 
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
that would be the intention sorry if I
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
can respond to that um that would be the
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
intention of the Department of making
 
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:40.360 align:start position:0%
sure right those dollars are going to
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
the right places rather than subsidizing
 
00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
somebody who already has
 
00:29:49.389 --> 00:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
one okay uh well I will representative
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
Thomas um unless you have um a brand new
 
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
question let's make this the last one
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
and I think we're starting to go around
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
in a circle here so what's your question
 
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
uh it has not been asked before um
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
referring to lines 20 and 21 on page one
 
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:07.640 align:start position:0%
this is developing an incentive or
 
00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
rebate program or competitive Grant
 
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity for renewable thermal and
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
electric energy projects for political
 
00:30:17.509 --> 00:30:17.519 align:start position:0%
subdivisions my question is what is the
 
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
Department's plans on how to inform and
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
publicize that these new programs exist
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
sure so we um probably taking a step
 
00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559 align:start position:0%
back um we would do a stakeholder
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
process to figure out what exactly would
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
work for municipalities who engaging
 
00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
with uh with folks either it be the
 
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
developers or the municipalities or
 
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
through the municipal Association and
 
00:30:43.389 --> 00:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
other entities um to figure out you know
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
what are Town's really looking for right
 
00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
we don't want to design a program where
 
00:30:48.269 --> 00:30:48.279 align:start position:0%
nobody wants and we want to design it
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
where the the demand
 
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
is um that being said um we would
 
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
publicize it we would work with folks
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
like the municipal Association we work
 
00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
with Town energy commit to make sure
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
that these um programs are well noticed
 
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
and well um uh well advertised to the
 
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:07.240 align:start position:0%
the folks who would actually be in the
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
shoes of of drafting these applications
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
for when the competitive Grant programs
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
open go ahead thank you um it sounds
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
like there there could potentially be
 
00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:19.559 align:start position:0%
money left on the table what would
 
00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
happen to
 
00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
that I'm uh I'm sorry where where would
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
money be left on the table if if
 
00:31:30.029 --> 00:31:30.039 align:start position:0%
application if not enough applications
 
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
come in um or the stakeholders don't
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
know about it and they don't apply
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
sounds like there there's a potential
 
00:31:38.629 --> 00:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
for money to be left on the table yeah
 
00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
um so in that circumstance thank you for
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
the question in that circumstance um
 
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
what has been the policy of the
 
00:31:44.629 --> 00:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
department is to just carry forward the
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
funds into the next year um for the
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
program so additional funds would just
 
00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:51.039 align:start position:0%
sort of roll forward um there is a
 
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
requirement that we rebalance funding um
 
00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
as the um uh Within two-year period just
 
00:32:00.269 --> 00:32:00.279 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the spread between
 
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:01.720 align:start position:0%
commercial industrial programs and
 
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
residential matches what the actual
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
electricity demand
 
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
is okay um I think we've covered the
 
00:32:09.549 --> 00:32:09.559 align:start position:0%
realm of questions
 
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
here thank you uh Josh Mr Elliot and the
 
00:32:17.389 --> 00:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
the the new Griffin Rivers well
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
temporary at least
 
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
temporary um I don't having I don't
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I don't see any
 
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
other you
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
do I'll be so
 
00:32:31.389 --> 00:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
yes okay if uh please be quick putting
 
00:32:33.789 --> 00:32:33.799 align:start position:0%
your card in next time because uh there
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
we have a sander here waiting absolutely
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
so um I apologize I wasn't planning to
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
speak um but just wanted to jump in I
 
00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
heard a number of questions that I
 
00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
thought uh I could clarify on um Sam
 
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
Evans Brown executive director of clean
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
energy New Hampshire um we are in
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
support of this bill um we were in
 
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
support of it when it was uh looking to
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
add battery storage into eligible uh
 
00:32:58.629 --> 00:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
uses of thef we heard heard the concerns
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
about the fact that battery storage does
 
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
not generate uh wrecks and therefore
 
00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be considered but you know I
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
frankly think that may that concern is
 
00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
may be a little overblown um there
 
00:33:10.629 --> 00:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
really is a need for those type of
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
funding in uh the stes state of New
 
00:33:14.629 --> 00:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but even as written I think we
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
would support this bill there is a real
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
need for funding streams for municipal
 
00:33:20.669 --> 00:33:20.679 align:start position:0%
projects and our circuit Rider program
 
00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
sees that every day um there there are a
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
lot of really Innovative and exciting
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
projects that municipalities are working
 
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
on that don't have flexible sources of
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
funding that can that can fund them um
 
00:33:33.789 --> 00:33:33.799 align:start position:0%
and just as a again a very quick note we
 
00:33:36.509 --> 00:33:36.519 align:start position:0%
also do not see the residential solar
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
rebate as being additive we believe that
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
at this point that that program is
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
really just sending money to folks that
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
would have installed solar regardless
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
and so we support the elimination of
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
that program and using those funds for a
 
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
better and higher purpose and that we've
 
00:33:52.669 --> 00:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
come to that conclusion through a lot of
 
00:33:54.029 --> 00:33:54.039 align:start position:0%
consultation with our members that are
 
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
in the residential solar space so um
 
00:34:00.669 --> 00:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
ahead representative par thank you chair
 
00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh Mr Brown for your
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
testimony um my question is um I
 
00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
understand from your letter uh we're not
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
talking Rex here for Batteries but
 
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
because this bill was originally
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
directed towards batteries and not
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
towards replacing uh a part of our rsas
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
with a as of yet to be written law um
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
I'm feeling at a loss when I'm reading
 
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
this bill I'm thinking that we do need
 
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
something to flatten the curve and
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
batteries are what we need if not Rex
 
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
something else can you explain why the
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
focus of the bill deviated from that to
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
replace um rsas with as of yet Unwritten
 
00:34:51.869 --> 00:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
policy uh so so I would agree with Josh
 
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
Elliott's characterization that the
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
concern is that the the renewable energy
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard is a
 
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
self-balancing policy right so you if
 
00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
you have not enough renewable energy
 
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
credits uh alternative compliance
 
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
payments are used to create projects
 
00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
that generate enough renewable energy
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
credits that make the alternative
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
compliance payments go away so so I I
 
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:13.079 align:start position:0%
understand that concern that that the uh
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
investing in technologies that do not
 
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
generate renewable energy credits
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
undermines the policy design of the ren
 
00:35:20.589 --> 00:35:20.599 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard currently
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
there's only one program that I know of
 
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
that is is uh putting money on the table
 
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
to make batteries happen it's the clean
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
energy fund which came from the 2017
 
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
divestiture of of psn's eversource's
 
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
generation assets um the the residential
 
00:35:38.349 --> 00:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
the residential battery program is fully
 
00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:40.280 align:start position:0%
subscribed the commercial battery
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
program um the you know the rebate
 
00:35:44.349 --> 00:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
levels aren't high enough and so there's
 
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
that we are trying to work with
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
eversource and the doe to to figure out
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
how to get that money out the door but
 
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
very limited funding I mean the the
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
whole clean energy fund is $5 million uh
 
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
and and the the the programs that are
 
00:35:58.309 --> 00:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
welld designed that money goes out the
 
00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
door very very quickly so uh we were in
 
00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:02.440 align:start position:0%
support of the initial idea because
 
00:36:04.109 --> 00:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
although there was the potential that it
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
might mess with the RPS design there is
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
a real need and there aren't many
 
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
programs in New Hampshire that are that
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
are getting batteries deployed so we
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
viewed that as a trade-off and something
 
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:15.160 align:start position:0%
we were willing to
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
support okay with that thank you very
 
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
same EV Brown I declare close the public
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
hearing for S Bill
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
303 since we're running a little late
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to move right on to the next
 
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
bill which is Senate Bill 388 and
 
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
welcome Senator Pearl U thank you for
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
being here I know you're busy uh
 
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate you coming before us well
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
good morning members of st&amp; for the
 
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
record my name is Senator Howard Pearl
 
00:36:44.109 --> 00:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
from District 17 I live in the Great
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
town of Lowden and uh pleasure to be in
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
front of your committee today I am here
 
00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
to introduce Senate Bill 388 relative to
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
the administration of utilities by the
 
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
department of energy th this bill was a
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
request from the doe and it makes some
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
technical changes to uh the rsas that
 
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
govern them and I'm going to let uh Josh
 
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
explain those in detail because he'll do
 
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
a better job than I will additionally uh
 
00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:09.800 align:start position:0%
the department has requested an
 
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
amendment since the Senate hearing
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of more technical
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
changes they've discovered they'd like
 
00:37:16.109 --> 00:37:16.119 align:start position:0%
to make so they're they're going to
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
present you with language for an
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'm fully in support of
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
that if the committee decides to add
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
that onto the bill there shouldn't be
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
any objection from the Senate on that so
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to uh hopefully let
 
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
you call Josh next and let him give
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
explain all the technical uh aspects of
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
the Bill thank you does anybody have a
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
able to answer this Senator um what was
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
the intention of changing homeowners to
 
00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
households on line uh 20 that's section
 
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
two section three Net
 
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
metering it says you know low moderate
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
income used to be homeowners now it's
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
going to be households what what was the
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
thinking behind that thank you
 
00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:04.520 align:start position:0%

I'm honestly going to let Josh answer
 
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
that it was a technical change that the
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
department requested is and they felt
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
better represented the language than
 
00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
what we currently have thank
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%

just like to uh reiterate our thanks uh
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
to Senator Pearl for um introducing this
 
00:39:22.309 --> 00:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
bill for us um so I am going to go
 
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
through sort of a section by section um
 
00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:27.079 align:start position:0%
of the bill um to give you a sense of
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
what it does CU there's lots of little
 
00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
sort of little changes here and there um
 
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
that will help the department uh
 
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
function more effectively and um be able
 
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
to um be able to provide better value to
 
00:39:41.309 --> 00:39:41.319 align:start position:0%
the citizens of the State of New
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um going through the Section
 
00:39:46.829 --> 00:39:46.839 align:start position:0%
by section uh section one and two um
 
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
this is just a clarification that uh
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
public utilities are required to comply
 
00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:53.800 align:start position:0%
with Department
 
00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:56.359 align:start position:0%
orders um with section two being the
 
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
penalty mechanism for not following
 
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.599 align:start position:0%
those um the commission currently has
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
this uh statutory Authority while the
 
00:40:04.589 --> 00:40:04.599 align:start position:0%
department does not so that's just adds
 
00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
in or the department um in those two
 
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
sections um section three um to uh
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
representative kaplan's earlier question
 
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
um the change from homeowners to
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
households does two things um it uh both
 
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
makes the statute consistent um
 
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
households is in other references in
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
that section um as well as ensuring the
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
clarity that um home home owners has a
 
00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
very distinctive you actually own the
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
residence that you live in versus
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
household um makes it clear that yes
 
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
renters are eligible for this program as
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
well so it's not just constrained to
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
those who actually um who own their own
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
home um whatever it may be um sections
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
four and five of the bill um this is
 
00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:49.720 align:start position:0%
another technical cleanup um regarding
 
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
the date of when the um renewable energy
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
fund annual report is filed um these
 
00:40:57.069 --> 00:40:57.079 align:start position:0%
sections do not conflict conflict with
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
what is in Senate Bill 303 so you can
 
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
leave these here and leave the one in
 
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
303 and nothing's going to get knocked a
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
skew um but just make sure that those um
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
dates all then line up um with the new
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
timeline that was established um in
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 for when all these
 
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
mechanisms happen uh section six of the
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
bill um this gets into our assessing
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
Authority um which is what we do um to
 
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
the utilities um in order to provide
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
that regulatory oversight we conduct an
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
assessment on the utilities for that um
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
for those Services um
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
the um for entities that U make less
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
than $10,000 in Revenue in a particular
 
00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
year are exempt from the statute um
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a lot of times we don't
 
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
know what a entity's revenues look like
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
until we send out the assessment so
 
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
we'll send out the assessment and then
 
00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:54.839 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we will get back oh you know
 
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
what here's our exemption or we want to
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
be exempt um which is fine but then you
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
have to recalculate everything based on
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
that exemption so this provides a very
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
clear window and direction that if you
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
are filing for an exemption to the
 
00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
assessment here's the period in which
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
you do it so our business office isn't
 
00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:11.240 align:start position:0%
constantly recalculating recalculating
 
00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
recalculating every time one of these
 
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
things comes back in we do communicate
 
00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
with these entities
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
frequently um you know Things fall
 
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
through the crack there are staff
 
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
changes things like that happen but that
 
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
that um makes it clear that our business
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
office is just not continually turning
 
00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
and recalculating these assessments
 
00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:31.480 align:start position:0%
um sections seven and 8 of the bill um
 
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
these are just holdover statutes um that
 
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
existed when uh that were carried over
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
from the former um officer strategic
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
initiatives um they're no longer
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
relevant to the department and can just
 
00:42:45.549 --> 00:42:45.559 align:start position:0%
be removed from statute um I realized
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
based on the the title of the sections
 
00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:50.839 align:start position:0%
about personal Wireless Services um I
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
just want to make it very very clear
 
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
that this does nothing to change
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities um ability or authority
 
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
to regulate cell phone towers in their
 
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
own communities so that is kept intact
 
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
this is just removing the department
 
00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
from it because there were there were
 
00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
just some straggler statutes there
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
um that being said um as uh rep as uh
 
00:43:13.549 --> 00:43:13.559 align:start position:0%
Senator Pearl um referenced we have two
 
00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
additional changes um that we would like
 
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
um to see made that are just purely
 
00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:20.680 align:start position:0%
technical um if the letter that I
 
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
believe is is going around as on the
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
back side of the page so references
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
those two um changes one of them is a
 
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
change to section three um just
 
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
clarifying that um for this um program
 
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
that only new solar installations are
 
00:43:37.549 --> 00:43:37.559 align:start position:0%
are eligible rather than existing ones
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
that then become one of these um and
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
then adding in um at the very end of the
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
um section on line 23 um allowing the
 
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
department to rank these projects based
 
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
on their demonstrated project Readiness
 
00:43:54.549 --> 00:43:54.559 align:start position:0%
um so essentially we just want to avoid
 
00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
the situation where someone could come
 
00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
in propose this great project that um
 
00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:01.720 align:start position:0%
says provides you know 100% of the
 
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
output to um
 
00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
LMI um customers um for benefits on
 
00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:10.280 align:start position:0%
their bill um but is clearly not project
 
00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
ready and there's certain things that
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
demonstrate project Readiness such as
 
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
site control um looking at
 
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
interconnection um there's a whole you
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
know Finance firm financing plans and
 
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
things like that we wouldn't want to see
 
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
um Bad actors coming in with projects
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
that then um eat up that capacity um
 
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
that mean then viable projects which may
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
have slightly lower because they
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
actually have calculated what they're
 
00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing um then get knocked
 
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
out so while there might be this sort of
 
00:44:39.309 --> 00:44:39.319 align:start position:0%
Pie in the Sky um project that comes in
 
00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:41.720 align:start position:0%
um that would get selected without
 
00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
having this criteria to be able to judge
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
based on Project Readiness um the last
 
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
two um requests are are combined um are
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
actually um dealing with uh House Bill
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
232 um which I know Mr chairman you
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
sponsored last year dealing with thermal
 
00:44:58.589 --> 00:44:58.599 align:start position:0%
wrecks um um just adding our favorite
 
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
phrase um by rule or by order um to
 
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
those two sections of Statute that were
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
amended um to allow that alternative
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
metering methodology um that'll make it
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
clear that we can do this by order um as
 
00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
an interim before the formal Ru making
 
00:45:15.309 --> 00:45:15.319 align:start position:0%
process begins um so we' had a couple of
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
conversations with folks who are who
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
work in this area um and this is a this
 
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
is a um certainly a desired change that
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
would help the department be able to do
 
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
implementation faster than um current
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
statute would allow
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
so with that uh Mr chairman I'm happy to
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
pause and take any questions I realize
 
00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:33.720 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of disjointed pieces all over
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
the place as technical cleanup bills
 
00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:36.200 align:start position:0%
tend to
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
be thank you very much questions from
 
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
the committee representative McGee thank
 
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you Mr Elliot for
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question again um I have lots
 
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
of questions uh but I'm just going to
 
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
start with uh section six on uh line 11
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
page two and my question is it says any
 
00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:57.880 align:start position:0%
public utility or other assessed entity
 
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
could you define for me as part one of
 
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
this question what what other assessed
 
00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
entities would qualify or would be
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
required to be noticed
 
00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
here that is a good question I would
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
like to just double check with our
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
business office to make sure I wouldn't
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
want to Fathom a guess and have that
 
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
guess be wrong okay um but I'm happy to
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
to get back to you and the rest of the
 
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
committee as to what those other
 
00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
entities would be thank you and then on
 
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
the bolded um part from line 14 on until
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
it concludes uh that paragraph on on
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
line 18 I was a little confused because
 
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
it it basically says you know you you
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
you need to request this exemption you
 
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
need to get your request in here's the
 
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
period it's from July 1st beginning of
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
that year uh and we need to see it by
 
00:46:45.549 --> 00:46:45.559 align:start position:0%
the 30th so that's I guess a 30-day
 
00:46:48.349 --> 00:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
period my question is are there any
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
processes around this is it push is it
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
pull how do people become aware that
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
this law is changing so that they can
 
00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.589 align:start position:0%
this law is changing so that they can
comply

00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
comply
 
00:46:59.309 --> 00:46:59.319 align:start position:0%
and because it just it seems a little
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
vague in the way it's defined here and I
 
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
didn't know if there was any other
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
statutory language anywhere that
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
actually would uh help people understand
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
what their requirements are yes so these
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
um and now that you've asked that
 
00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
question and i' I've thought of one of
 
00:47:16.829 --> 00:47:16.839 align:start position:0%
the assessed entities that might be so
 
00:47:18.589 --> 00:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers for example would
 
00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:20.200 align:start position:0%
be considered an assessed entity I am
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
not sure how much further broad it gets
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
but that's at least one of the answers
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
to your previous question um or
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
regarding the process um this is
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
something that we do on a yearly basis
 
00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:32.359 align:start position:0%
um these entities are required to
 
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
register with the department so we know
 
00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
who these folks are we have their
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
contact information um certainly any
 
00:47:38.349 --> 00:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
change like this would be communicated
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
well in advance of saying you know as
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
the assessment period comes up if you're
 
00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
you know with this language if you're
 
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
seeking to file an exemption you know
 
00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
you this is the period in which you can
 
00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
file an exemption before we go through
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
all the work of actually calculating
 
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
everything um so that that Outreach
 
00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
would happen to make sure the entities
 
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
aren't caught by surprise and somebody
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't file something on August 1st and
 
00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
then oh sorry no like there would be we
 
00:48:02.349 --> 00:48:02.359 align:start position:0%
would communicate these changes to those
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
assessment is it an electronic form or
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
paper um that is a good question I can
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
check with our business office on that
 
00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
um I believe you know what I'm not even
 
00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
going to Fathom a guest I will check
 
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
with our business office folks who who
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
work on this and um and get an answer
 
00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:19.150 align:start position:0%
work on this and um and get an answer
for

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the committee
 
00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.270 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the committee
representative

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
Mr Elliott I have a question about the
 
00:48:30.309 --> 00:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh the the U the additions that you
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
would like to see in this in this bill
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
and that's uh the you know the handout
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
that you just gave us addition two and
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
three it seems that that has to do with
 
00:48:40.109 --> 00:48:40.119 align:start position:0%
with useful thermal energy and the
 
00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
wrecks that they can receive uh I just
 
00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
wondering could you
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
quantify the the number of of plants if
 
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
you will that would be that would be
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
affected by these changes sure thank you
 
00:48:56.589 --> 00:48:56.599 align:start position:0%
for the question um so uh House Bill 232
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
um um which uh passed the legislature
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
last session um uh sort of sought to be
 
00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
able to meter um uh I should say get
 
00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
around the uh not get around address the
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
issue regarding small thermal um Rec
 
00:49:14.589 --> 00:49:14.599 align:start position:0%
producers typically this would be um you
 
00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
know if it's a small facility um um all
 
00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
the way down to the size of somebody's
 
00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
own Uh Wood B wood pellet poer in their
 
00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:24.440 align:start position:0%
that they use for home heating for
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
example um the statute the statute um as
 
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
written has the word meter in it which
 
00:49:33.789 --> 00:49:33.799 align:start position:0%
has a very defined definition of um but
 
00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
also uh needs to be a revenue grade
 
00:49:38.349 --> 00:49:38.359 align:start position:0%
meter um in order to be able to match
 
00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
those tolerances because there is um
 
00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
your in theory where you would be
 
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
generating renewable energy certificates
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
from it you need to have a revenue grade
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
meter so you know exactly what is
 
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
produced in order to know exactly what
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
um uh the number of wrecks that are
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
being produced from that facility um
 
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
those meters are quite qu very expensive
 
00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
um so for the smaller systems it does
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
not make any Financial sense to be able
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
to uh to actually install one of those
 
00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
because whatever installing one of those
 
00:50:06.789 --> 00:50:06.799 align:start position:0%
types of meters is going to be far more
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
expensive than any of the the uh Revenue
 
00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
that you would generate from any of the
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
wrecks that are being produced um This
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
was um brought forward by a number of
 
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
folks last year um about trying to find
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
a uh happy medium in between the two of
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
developing sort of this alternative
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
metering methodology for those smaller
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
facilities that doesn't require one of
 
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
those Revenue grade meters
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
um so they would be able to be eligible
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
to um produce um thermal recks as well
 
00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
followup question I follow up so I don't
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
so would the rules or orders produced by
 
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
your department would that have to do
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
with with requiring or allowing those
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
kind of meters um it would as the
 
00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
statute as it's constructed um requires
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
us to uh approve an alternative metering
 
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
methodology that is proposed through a
 
00:50:56.109 --> 00:50:56.119 align:start position:0%
stakeholder process um but the way that
 
00:50:58.349 --> 00:50:58.359 align:start position:0%
the statute is constructed um it would
 
00:50:59.910 --> 00:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
require us to go through the entire
 
00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
formal rule making process um which is
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
can be long can be a long process um and
 
00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:07.480 align:start position:0%
obviously there's a there's a question
 
00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
with um of just changing one SP small
 
00:51:12.789 --> 00:51:12.799 align:start position:0%
part of the rules versus a holistic
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
looking at all the rules in in in a
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
holistic sense because then you if you
 
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
change one little piece here you might
 
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
inadvertently cause an issue somewhere
 
00:51:22.349 --> 00:51:22.359 align:start position:0%
else that is then can't be rectified um
 
00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
by adding the language um by rule or by
 
00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:26.200 align:start position:0%
order um it allows the department
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
basically to issue an order which has
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
the full effect of of um rules as an
 
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
interim until the formal rule making
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
process looking at all the rules within
 
00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:37.640 align:start position:0%
that section puc 2500 in case anyone's
 
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
curious um done on a holistic basis but
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that the statute itself can be
 
00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
implemented before that holistic role
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
making process goes
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
through further questions for Mr Elliott
 
00:51:50.559 --> 00:51:53.349 align:start position:0%
through further questions for Mr Elliott
representative

00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%

descriptive uh uh paper uh you refer to
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
sections one and sections sections one
 
00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
and two uh where the public utilities
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
are mandated to comply with the
 
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
Department orders uh does that ALS does
 
00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:53.720 align:start position:0%
that work in conjunction with the Pu or
 
00:52:57.069 --> 00:52:57.079 align:start position:0%
is it an exclusive uh uh Mandate of
 
00:52:59.710 --> 00:52:59.720 align:start position:0%
authority to the department um thank you
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
for the question um no it is adding uh
 
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
so that the existing statute that you
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
see here being amended um is for the
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission to have that
 
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
Authority um our request here is just to
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
add the department so we would have the
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
similar authorities to the puc in just
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
in just in these regards okay thank
 
00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
Thomas yes uh thank you Mr chair in
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
Section 8 on line 30 um the the repeals
 
00:53:33.789 --> 00:53:33.799 align:start position:0%
relative to guidance and rulemaking by
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
the department of energy can you tell me
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
what specific aspects of guidance and
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
Rule making are being repe repealed um
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
sure uh thank you for the question my
 
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
apologies um yes those um sections um
 
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
deal with um personal wireless service
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
facilities um that had the department
 
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
that the well I should say at that point
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
it would have been the office of energy
 
00:53:59.069 --> 00:53:59.079 align:start position:0%
and planning um um in the early 2000s um
 
00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
was tasked with coming up with um a
 
00:54:04.829 --> 00:54:04.839 align:start position:0%
number of sort of finite um proposals
 
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
around the sighting of of personal
 
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
Wireless facilities cell phone towers um
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
that has then been superseded by um uh
 
00:54:14.109 --> 00:54:14.119 align:start position:0%
further developments by the
 
00:54:15.549 --> 00:54:15.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities themselves in terms of
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
how they look at these things um so it's
 
00:54:20.789 --> 00:54:20.799 align:start position:0%
sort of it's no longer relevant um and
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
it's no longer within the purview of of
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.359 --> 00:54:26.870 align:start position:0%
 
department

00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:30.230 align:start position:0%
department
additional

00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I want to thank
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
you Mr Elliot for being here to thank

00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:40.799 align:start position:0%
bill and also describe your suggested
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
changes to it I have no more pink cards

01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
their cost by producing electricity on
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
site the interconnection for small solar
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
arrays is typically straightforward uh
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
although for larger solar arrays like
 
01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:51.640 align:start position:0%
those of businesses and interconnections
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
can be very
 
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
complicated this already complicated
 
01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
inter connection process is then further
 
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
Complicated by the lack of clear rules
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
of the road and for businesses solar
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
developers and for the utilities this
 
01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
bill is intended to help break the Log
 
01:03:11.109 --> 01:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
Jam uh with the process of providing uh
 
01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
those clear rules of the road in the Pu
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
p900 rules I know I've heard from
 
01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
companies in my district about the
 
01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
issues and I'm sure many of them uh
 
01:03:22.589 --> 01:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
you've heard from them as well and if
 
01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:23.839 align:start position:0%
you haven't I think you're going to hear
 
01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
from them
 
01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
today this bill amends is amended by the
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
Senate and would have the department of
 
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
energy create drafted rules to address
 
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
this issue in a comprehensive way
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
ensuring Clarity for business looking to
 
01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
install solar as well as solar
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
developers and the department of energy
 
01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
is taking this issue very seriously they
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
work with members of the Senate energy
 
01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
committee on the language to make sure
 
01:03:49.789 --> 01:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
that the bill is workable and
 
01:03:51.549 --> 01:03:51.559 align:start position:0%
implementable and while there are some
 
01:03:53.309 --> 01:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
areas of agreement about where these
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
rules what these rules should look like
 
01:03:57.870 --> 01:03:57.880 align:start position:0%
there are other areas of disagreement um
 
01:03:59.950 --> 01:03:59.960 align:start position:0%
between those involved in sorting out
 
01:04:02.269 --> 01:04:02.279 align:start position:0%
the issues and it will take some time
 
01:04:03.789 --> 01:04:03.799 align:start position:0%
and I know there's several companies
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
here that can speak to their experiences
 
01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
with this issue as well as the
 
01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
department of energy who will be able to
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
lay out how this process will work uh
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
and having spoken uh with somebody just
 
01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
a few minutes ago uh there's definitely
 
01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:19.160 align:start position:0%
uh going to be some proposed
 
01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
amendments because of rules and uh so
 
01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
um I will take any questions you have
 
01:04:30.430 --> 01:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
but I mean go ahead Senator thank you
 
01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:32.799 align:start position:0%
very much uh I would remind members that
 
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
we have 12 pink cards here we're going
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
to hear a lot about this
 
01:04:41.789 --> 01:04:41.799 align:start position:0%
legislation representative Corman has a
 
01:04:44.109 --> 01:04:44.119 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
you senator for taking my question the
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced had a deadline for
 
01:04:52.349 --> 01:04:52.359 align:start position:0%
the rules to be adopted by December 31
 
01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
2024 with the updated procedures in
 
01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
effect uh the next day and the amendment
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
removes that deadline uh why it needed
 
01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:05.079 align:start position:0%
some time to uh to create the rules
 
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
otherwise it wouldn't have been
 
01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.069 align:start position:0%
otherwise it wouldn't have been
workable

01:05:09.069 --> 01:05:09.079 align:start position:0%
workable
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
followup given that why not a deadline a
 
01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
little further out rather than just this
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
amorphous bill that just says there will
 
01:05:20.589 --> 01:05:20.599 align:start position:0%
be rules and we don't know when right I
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
think we adopted 60 days did we adopt 60
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
days Mike are you in
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
here Mike
 
01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:31.720 align:start position:0%
Lata I think I think we had mentioned
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
that didn't didn't we adopt 60 days it
 
01:05:36.269 --> 01:05:36.279 align:start position:0%
says that it will open a proceeding but
 
01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say anything about when the
 
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
rules would be in
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
effect uh believe I it was my
 
01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
understanding was after 60 days of
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
guess okay we got the answer to that
 
01:05:59.630 --> 01:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
question we'll deliberate on that thank
 
01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:02.920 align:start position:0%

the amendment
 
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
so the procedure according to house
 
01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
rules is that we do not consider
 
01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
amendments at a public hearing I do have
 
01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
a copy of an amendment that was handed
 
01:08:10.829 --> 01:08:10.839 align:start position:0%
to me right before the meeting began we
 
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
do not however consider amendments at a
 
01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.110 align:start position:0%
do not however consider amendments at a
public

01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
hearing out of um respect for
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
representative Horan I allowed him to
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
speak here I just spoke to senator avard
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
about whether he had seen this amendment
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
and he had
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
not I will allow Mr cble who I
 
01:08:35.279 --> 01:08:36.669 align:start position:0%
not I will allow Mr cble who I
understand

01:08:36.669 --> 01:08:36.679 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
is uh who has requested this amendment
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
to speak briefly about the subject and
 
01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:47.239 align:start position:0%
the kinds of changes that will be made
 
01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
but not speak to the amendment
 
01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
itself so Mr Campbell if you want to
 
01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
come up and give us an a synopsis
 
01:08:58.510 --> 01:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
of changes that you would like to see
 
01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
made then we'll consider those thank you
 
01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
okay and and I and I do recognize the
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
FAA of not being able to get this to uh
 
01:09:11.709 --> 01:09:11.719 align:start position:0%
Senator avard we did email him copies we
 
01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
did reach out to his office we did call
 
01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
his staff and ask for return phone calls
 
01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
so I do respect this process a great
 
01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
deal um I think the problem with the
 
01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
bill you guys already identified there's
 
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
no end date for when they're going to
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
make rules um B I'm sorry uh my name is
 
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
pachy Campbell I am uh a real estate
 
01:09:34.829 --> 01:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
developer I own a Solar Company I'm a
 
01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:37.799 align:start position:0%
former State Rep here in New Hampshire
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to serve like you're
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
serving and I enjoyed it
 
01:09:44.269 --> 01:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
immensely um I also was before this
 
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
Committee in August of
 
01:09:48.990 --> 01:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
2022 and the committee was gracious
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
enough to do a committee Amendment then
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
and we passed a bill as related to uh
 
01:09:57.390 --> 01:09:57.400 align:start position:0%
timing of net meter credit Billings and
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
I think that the amendment that I'm
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
looking for is similar to that that the
 
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
problem is actually in the rules and I
 
01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
think the law needs to be clarified
 
01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
where there's stronger problems created
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
by the existing rules in
 
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
pc900 and that's why I'm asking that if
 
01:10:16.189 --> 01:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
you're going to pass a bill that says
 
01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
hey just go make rules say we're going
 
01:10:20.189 --> 01:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
to make rules and they're going to be on
 
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
a b CDE e and we'll make rules around
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
that content that they'll be specific
 
01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
criteria such as 10 days to respond that
 
01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
you'll provide an email or a way to
 
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
communicate with the utility right now
 
01:10:36.669 --> 01:10:36.679 align:start position:0%
under the current rules utility sends
 
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
you a do not reply email it's kind of
 
01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
problematic you can't really communicate
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
with them so I'm sorry I think we need
 
01:10:45.390 --> 01:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
to put in law that you will give the
 
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
customer generator or the contractor
 
01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
ability to conquer to so very simple
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
things that I think are reasonable
 
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:59.310 --> 01:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
you never know how these are going to go
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
but I I guess the the problem that I
 
01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
have with the bill it with the current
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
process that I'm asking to be amended is
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
that I appreciate Senator avar saying
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
hey we need rules but as is typical the
 
01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
amendment says we're going to open a
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
hearing and you're never going to know
 
01:11:15.630 --> 01:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
when you're going to see those rules and
 
01:11:17.229 --> 01:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
for reference we haven't seen any rules
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
on the bill that you passed two years
 
01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
ago as it relates to payments and the
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
utility refused to make those payments
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
until the rules were passed and I had to
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
remind them quite aggressively that they
 
01:11:30.430 --> 01:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
need to follow the law and after 18
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
months I finally got a letter from uh
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
eversource saying all right Mr Campbell
 
01:11:36.189 --> 01:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
we will start following the law we were
 
01:11:38.189 --> 01:11:38.199 align:start position:0%
just trying to figure out the process so
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
literally we have some utilities that
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
are acting Above the Law so that's why I
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
think it's important that we put
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
specific things in the law because with
 
01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
respect to Senator
 
01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
avard this is my folder on the rsas and
 
01:11:55.229 --> 01:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
the laws there's over 100 pages of rulle
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
TOS in
 
01:11:58.950 --> 01:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
p900 and I've highlighted a couple of
 
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
them um one of them for interconnection
 
01:12:04.590 --> 01:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
agreements over 100 kilowatts the the
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
rule essentially that the utilities will
 
01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
just tell you what they're going to do
 
01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
in their annual policy there is
 
01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely no rules they just do it so I
 
01:12:15.629 --> 01:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
think there's a need for rules there um
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
when you look at responses it says
 
01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
within 60 business days of receipt for
 
01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
those of you who know what a business
 
01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
day is that means 3 months before they
 
01:12:25.149 --> 01:12:25.159 align:start position:0%
even have to respond to me as a customer
 
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
Custer that's why I'm saying
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
specifically in my Amendment you have 10
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
days to either say hey I'd like more
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
information or your application is
 
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
complete or ideally approve it the other
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh section of the rules that I think
 
01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
creates a problem for the utilities in
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
that that they basically say that the
 
01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
invent that you need an upgrade so you
 
01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
need to go from a 10 kilowatt
 
01:12:50.350 --> 01:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
Transformer to a 25 kilowatt Transformer
 
01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
they actually review the whole
 
01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
interconnection agreement they then have
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
you install the system system they then
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
have you verify that you really wanted
 
01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
to upgrade the Transformer they then
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
have you get the local approval from the
 
01:13:03.310 --> 01:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
exhibit B from the local utility which
 
01:13:06.030 --> 01:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
means you now spent your 80 70 grand on
 
01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
your solar system then they'll start the
 
01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
process of what's a work order with the
 
01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
construction Department from one
 
01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
Department asking another department to
 
01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
do something and that's sort of created
 
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
in these rules so one of the things I'm
 
01:13:20.350 --> 01:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
trying to ask you to do is basically say
 
01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
if you have a service this a 60 amp
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
breaker it flows into two directions
 
01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
already that happened long before there
 
01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
was solar it is a stupid device it it
 
01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
either has 60 amps in or 60 amps out 60
 
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
and 60 doesn't equal
 
01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
120 that you you ask the question about
 
01:13:40.510 --> 01:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
behind the meter that behind the meter
 
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
means that that if I have solar here and
 
01:13:44.189 --> 01:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
it Taps the line and this breaker is
 
01:13:47.229 --> 01:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
calling for power goes into the house if
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
it goes out of this line it goes onto
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
the grid it goes right into the next
 
01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
house as if it was behind the meter so
 
01:13:56.229 --> 01:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
one of my big problems is they make you
 
01:13:58.510 --> 01:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
do these these system impact studies
 
01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
usually on the projects over 100
 
01:14:03.629 --> 01:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
kilowatts took three and a half years to
 
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
not even get my approval in one project
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
I spent $37,000 on a study and I'm not
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
going to try and save the committee some
 
01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
time but basically there's a capacity
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
map so in the amendment I talk about if
 
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
you're under the capacity map you're
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
approved by right because you're
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
spending three years doing a study say
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
the information that's aailable on their
 
01:14:28.669 --> 01:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
website think about that I spent
 
01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
$37,000 to study whether or not I could
 
01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
do a 1 megawatt Project a customer
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
generator project when the capacity map
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
said there was capacity for 7 12
 
01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
megawatts if you further look at uh
 
01:14:42.629 --> 01:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
eversource's website their capacity map
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
is based on an analysis of if as if 50%
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
of their substation is offline for
 
01:14:50.669 --> 01:14:50.679 align:start position:0%
service or broken so this capacity map
 
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
is already reduced to 50% then you
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
further look at their own website it's
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
says if you're doing a project and it's
 
01:14:59.310 --> 01:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
over the capacity map then you do a
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
system impact study that's literally on
 
01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:03.080 align:start position:0%
their website but that's not what they
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
do because they can do whatever they
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
want is they delay you for years and
 
01:15:07.950 --> 01:15:07.960 align:start position:0%
years so I have two projects have been
 
01:15:10.110 --> 01:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
critically delayed I've spent thousands
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
of dollars on studies that's available
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
on their website and worse yet folks
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
because of what I just explained about
 
01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
the power I'm studying a bridge that my
 
01:15:23.189 --> 01:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
kilowatts never go over kilowatts it's
 
01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
physics it goes she has solar it goes to
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
his house maybe to his house it doesn't
 
01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
go across the table over there you
 
01:15:34.110 --> 01:15:34.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be studying a substation in do
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
for a customer generation project in
 
01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
Rochester yet they're requiring you to
 
01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
do that so that's why I'm asking for an
 
01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
amendment in law that says if you're
 
01:15:44.629 --> 01:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
under the capacity map no system impact
 
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
study that's basically what I'm saying
 
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
I'm also the other real big issue with
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
this and I'll try to be quick chairman I
 
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
know I'm pushing the envelope here um is
 
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
the the idea that if you need a service
 
01:15:58.030 --> 01:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
upgrade my if you don't remember my C my
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
company does dual access trackers we do
 
01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
primarily 20 kilow systems they are
 
01:16:04.669 --> 01:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
twice as powerful as a normal solar
 
01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
system so they're really like a 40
 
01:16:08.669 --> 01:16:08.679 align:start position:0%
kilowatt system so almost without
 
01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
exception if you're a residential
 
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
homeowner you have a 10 or a 15 kilowatt
 
01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
Transformer so I need an upgrade I can
 
01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
go to the construction Department I can
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
create a work order I've been a
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
developer for 25 years I've built all
 
01:16:21.070 --> 01:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
kinds of stuff I know how to do a work
 
01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
order and get a new service they do not
 
01:16:25.310 --> 01:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
let you do that process until you're
 
01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
done with the other process so in law
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
I'm saying if I submit a work order
 
01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
you're going to give me an estimate for
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
that service upgrade if I come in and
 
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
say I want 60 amps 600 amps or 1600 amps
 
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
and that's as large as it'll be for a
 
01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
customer generation this is customer
 
01:16:43.870 --> 01:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
generation this is distributed energy I
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
support the current law here in New
 
01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of small solar Diversified to
 
01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
the grid if you pass this law these
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
amendments that I'm looking for you'll
 
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
see that balanced distributed energy
 
01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
throughout the grid because the market
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
the entrepreneurs like myself will be
 
01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
driven to go to spots where there's
 
01:17:02.629 --> 01:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
capacity because it's going to be easier
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
to get the approval so with that I I I
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
hope you have questions can you
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
summarize the five problems you would
 
01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
like to solve and each problem summarize
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:21.229 --> 01:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
sentence ever source is
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
struggling there are bureaucracy that's
 
01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
not helped by the
 
01:17:28.030 --> 01:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
legislators and I think the problem I'm
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
trying to solve is that struggle that we
 
01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
have a problem as installers ask
 
01:17:36.270 --> 01:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
Regulators as Government ask industry
 
01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
ask utilities I'm trying to solve that
 
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
problem for
 
01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
everybody okay great thank you
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative licki has a question for
 
01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman I don't see a
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on this however what I see
 
01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
are a lot of things that are going to
 
01:17:53.470 --> 01:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
cost money basically these uh upgrades
 
01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
installations and so forth and these are
 
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
are these going to be socialized to the
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
rate payers through the um whatever
 
01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
process because you know each of these
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
things that you talk about is going to
 
01:18:06.990 --> 01:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
cost somebody money and if all rate
 
01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
payers are going to pay then this does
 
01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
not seem fair to me thank you for that
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
question and representative that is that
 
01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
is the heart of the matter one of the
 
01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:16.719 align:start position:0%
biggest problems this bill solves is if
 
01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
you look at line 27 it said U product
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
costess for all Associated secondary
 
01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
upgrades the customer generator should
 
01:18:25.629 --> 01:18:25.639 align:start position:0%
be responsible for cost of all those
 
01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
secondary upgrades I clarify in law
 
01:18:32.910 --> 01:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
because okay sorry remember the
 
01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
committee doesn't have that Amendment
 
01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
and we're not considering an amendment I
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
agree with you 100% if you did if you
 
01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
were to pass this bill I would suggest
 
01:18:43.709 --> 01:18:43.719 align:start position:0%
it be amended that the customer
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
generator pays for all utility upgrades
 
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
currently rep representative if you do a
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
new service there's rules on what
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
utilities can charge they have to give
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
so many feet for free so many telephone
 
01:18:58.189 --> 01:18:58.199 align:start position:0%
polls for free so there would be cost
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
shifting if you went in and said I'm
 
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
going to do a solar system and you
 
01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
follow their current rules of what
 
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to charge you so what I
 
01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
would propose if you're going to pass a
 
01:19:09.790 --> 01:19:09.800 align:start position:0%
bill on rulemaking put in law that
 
01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
customer generators have to pay for
 
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
those secondary
 
01:19:15.390 --> 01:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
upgrades right thank you further
 
01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative Kaplan thank
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you Mr Campell
 
01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
for for coming in um I don't have a
 
01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
question about the amendment because
 
01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
we're not supposed to talk about the
 
01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
amendment but I just I'm curious about
 
01:19:27.709 --> 01:19:27.719 align:start position:0%
the process were you involved in the
 
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
stakeholder hearings that the that the
 
01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
department held and or the Pu held to
 
01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
determine what kind of rules they would
 
01:19:37.149 --> 01:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
like to see in terms of interconnection
 
01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
were you part of that of those meetings
 
01:19:42.669 --> 01:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
and if you were like what what was your
 
01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
what was your um impression of those
 
01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
helpful and want to be kind I'm wearing
 
01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:51.800 align:start position:0%
my kindness jacket I think that some of
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
the scariest words the English language
 
01:19:54.430 --> 01:19:54.440 align:start position:0%
is hi I'm from the government I'm here
 
01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:55.149 align:start position:0%
is hi I'm from the government I'm here
to

01:19:55.149 --> 01:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:19:59.149 --> 01:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
that's generally how I feel um so um my
 
01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
involvement as a former representative
 
01:20:03.669 --> 01:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
has not been you know I'm running five
 
01:20:05.189 --> 01:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
companies I'm working fulltime I'm
 
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
father of five I'm married I'm doing
 
01:20:08.590 --> 01:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
what I can to get down here and
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully educate you guys in the
 
01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
process but to answer your question more
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
specifically I've done interconnections
 
01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts I've done them in Maine
 
01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
I've done them with Liberty I've done
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
with unel I've done them with eversource
 
01:20:20.350 --> 01:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
I've done hundreds of solar
 
01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
interconnection applications I
 
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
understand what I I believe is the
 
01:20:27.149 --> 01:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
problem and I think I'd like to
 
01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully have you take up my Amendment
 
01:20:31.709 --> 01:20:31.719 align:start position:0%
which I believe is the solution and that
 
01:20:34.510 --> 01:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
input because I I've applied for a
 
01:20:36.990 --> 01:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
formal complaint with the doe because I
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
don't think to answer your question I
 
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
don't think they did an adequate job in
 
01:20:40.510 --> 01:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
their hearings I don't think they've
 
01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
done an adequate job in their rulemaking
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
so 90 days ago I did form a file
 
01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
complaint about the interconnection
 
01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
process and the fact that it cost me
 
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
over a million dollar guys think about
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
that it cost me over a million dollars
 
01:20:56.510 --> 01:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
in loss revenue on the this one project
 
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
if I wasn't a well-healed 54 yearold guy
 
01:21:01.950 --> 01:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
with five different
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
businesses ever Source put back on the
 
01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
table bankruptcy for me as a
 
01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
developer there's a major major problem
 
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
with interconnection for customer
 
01:21:13.709 --> 01:21:13.719 align:start position:0%
generation and I hope that this
 
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
committee will work with Senator avard
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
work with the Senate to do an amendment
 
01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
that gives just three or four little
 
01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
guidelines things like pay for the
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
second grade ulties let us do regular
 
01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
work orders let us automatically connect
 
01:21:29.709 --> 01:21:29.719 align:start position:0%
if we're smaller than the service side
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
and under the capacity map that's all
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
I'm asking thank you okay thanks now you
 
01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
submitted a pink card to speak on this
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
bill you have just done that so correct
 
01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:41.239 align:start position:0%

other people who I appreciate the
 
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity and I hope that this will be
 
01:21:45.310 --> 01:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
a fruitful discussion and we'll all
 
01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
learn something so I will not be calling

whole lot of pizzas and chicken

nuggets we are just a small part of it
 
01:23:09.149 --> 01:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
but in today's worlds most things we buy
 
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
have been on a conveyor belt at one
 
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
point or another a little over 100 years
 
01:23:15.709 --> 01:23:15.719 align:start position:0%
in wire belt has done well we have a
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
great place to work full of fantastic
 
01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
people we've been recognized by business
 
01:23:21.149 --> 01:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire many times as a great
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
place to
 
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
work the most in the state I believe and
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
we have many great benefits among them
 
01:23:29.629 --> 01:23:29.639 align:start position:0%
is a profit sharing plan which has been
 
01:23:32.629 --> 01:23:32.639 align:start position:0%
impactful for many retirees I hope we
 
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
are an even better company in 100 years
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire is not a lowcost place
 
01:23:40.910 --> 01:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
to manufacture labor Health Care taxes
 
01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
and more contribute to a constantly
 
01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
changing landscape that we need to
 
01:23:46.629 --> 01:23:46.639 align:start position:0%
manage well to be globally
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
competitive when we relocated to Bedford
 
01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:51.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in February of
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
2023 we were planning for the future we
 
01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
invested in wrapping the 120,000 ft
 
01:23:59.149 --> 01:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
facility in an insulating skin to better
 
01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
manage the temperatures it gets cold
 
01:24:04.149 --> 01:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
here in the winter we've taken steps
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
with our equipment Air Supply lighting
 
01:24:09.950 --> 01:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
and more to manage our costs one of our
 
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
largest Investments on this front was
 
01:24:15.669 --> 01:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
the solar array on our roof
 
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
2,455 solar panels were planned would
 
01:24:23.669 --> 01:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
make up an 840 KW AC system designed to
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
offset 90% of our projected demand we
 
01:24:28.629 --> 01:24:28.639 align:start position:0%
took out a loan to help fund these
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
projects looking at them as an
 
01:24:31.470 --> 01:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
investment in our
 
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
future unfortunately we have yet to see
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
the full benefit of our investment in
 
01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
solar despite being in our building for
 
01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
over a year now over this past year
 
01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
after moving to the to our new location
 
01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
we saw our electric bills Peak at
 
01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:49.590 align:start position:0%
we saw our electric bills Peak at
$59,000

01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
$59,000
 
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
173 or yeah $59,000 in one month that
 
01:24:55.709 --> 01:24:55.719 align:start position:0%
more than a
 
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
$52,000 increase in one month over our
 
01:24:58.400 --> 01:24:59.590 align:start position:0%
$52,000 increase in one month over our
previous

01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
previous
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
location knowing that we're we had
 
01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
invested in solar and were paying
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
interest on those loans made some of
 
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
those months particularly
 
01:25:11.550 --> 01:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
frustrating candidly I want to spend our
 
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
money someplace else I think that we can
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
do that to the benefit of our employees
 
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
and our
 
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
business for
 
01:25:21.629 --> 01:25:21.639 align:start position:0%
context if we are up and running in
 
01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
April as planned it will have been
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
roughly 2 and a half years since our
 
01:25:27.669 --> 01:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
application and roughly one and a half
 
01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
years since we had ass signed agreement
 
01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
and those have been expensive paper
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
weights on our ceiling or on our roof
 
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
for over a year now please ensure the
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
timely adoption of comprehensive
 
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
interconnection thank you questions for
 
01:25:47.070 --> 01:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
Mr Greer representative
 
01:25:49.470 --> 01:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:25:51.390 --> 01:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
Mr Greer for taking my question I just
 
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I understand you have
 
01:25:55.390 --> 01:25:55.400 align:start position:0%
the panels yeah the photons are hitting
 
01:25:57.149 --> 01:25:57.159 align:start position:0%
them something's coming out of the
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
panels but you can't use any of it
 
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
because you're not interconnected none
 
01:26:03.390 --> 01:26:03.400 align:start position:0%
of it is actually going into your own uh
 
01:26:05.709 --> 01:26:05.719 align:start position:0%
wires and circuits within the building
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh we've got many people who can
 
01:26:12.189 --> 01:26:12.199 align:start position:0%
answer that much better than I can um I
 
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
think that there is a capacity thing
 
01:26:16.750 --> 01:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
where we can't turn it fully on until we
 
01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
get a recloser installed I believe but
 
01:26:21.390 --> 01:26:21.400 align:start position:0%
there are other folks here who can
 
01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:23.239 align:start position:0%
answer that better than I
 
01:26:23.239 --> 01:26:25.669 align:start position:0%
answer that better than I
can

01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions for Mr
 
01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:30.280 align:start position:0%
Greer seeing none I want to thank you
 
01:26:31.950 --> 01:26:31.960 align:start position:0%

since our humble beginning AG has
 
01:27:59.790 --> 01:27:59.800 align:start position:0%
consistently and considerably grown our

01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:12.070 align:start position:0%
necessary to provide for the communities
we

01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
serve as you can surely imagine a
 
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
facility of our size and nature has
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
significant energy needs while large
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
amounts of resource consumption is
 
01:28:23.629 --> 01:28:23.639 align:start position:0%
certainly not unique to AG our passion
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
to approach problems through a socially
 
01:28:29.109 --> 01:28:29.119 align:start position:0%
responsible and solutions based lens is
 
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
in 2021 we were able to align both our
 
01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal goal of reducing operational
 
01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
expenses and our commitment to
 
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
sustainability through the installation
 
01:28:40.109 --> 01:28:40.119 align:start position:0%
of a rooftop solar
 
01:28:43.950 --> 01:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
array our 1 megawatt AC solar array is
 
01:28:47.310 --> 01:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
made up of 3,400 solar panels that sit
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
on the top of our facility generating up
 
01:28:54.109 --> 01:28:54.119 align:start position:0%
to 1.45 million kilowatt hours of clean
 
01:28:54.119 --> 01:28:55.189 align:start position:0%
to 1.45 million kilowatt hours of clean
power

01:28:55.189 --> 01:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
power
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
annually at the time of installation it
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
was the largest rooftop array in the
 
01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
state and today offsets nearly 20% of
 
01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
our total electric load we are
 
01:29:06.430 --> 01:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
incredibly proud of this investment and
 
01:29:09.229 --> 01:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
want to expand however the journey to
 
01:29:11.870 --> 01:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
get where we are was not without its
 
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
challenges because of past obstacles and
 
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
the lack of process rectification since
 
01:29:19.390 --> 01:29:19.400 align:start position:0%
any further pursuit of an array
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
expansion has been sever severely
 
01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:25.709 align:start position:0%
expansion has been sever severely
quelled

01:29:25.709 --> 01:29:25.719 align:start position:0%
quelled
 
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
for example our first grid impact study
 
01:29:31.550 --> 01:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
forecasted unprecedented costs for
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
interconnection largely due to estimates
 
01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
for specific equipment that had been
 
01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
knowingly procured by other companies at
 
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
significantly lower prices to be clear
 
01:29:44.109 --> 01:29:44.119 align:start position:0%
here though pricing was not the problem
 
01:29:46.669 --> 01:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
it was the lack of set regul regulations
 
01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
to govern such a process that removed
 
01:29:52.189 --> 01:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
any opportunity for challenge or dispute
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
resolution additionally equipment
 
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
necessary for equip for interconnection
 
01:29:59.510 --> 01:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
was substanti substantially delayed
 
01:30:01.629 --> 01:30:01.639 align:start position:0%
without any advanced notice and
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
therefore we were unable to turn our
 
01:30:05.950 --> 01:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
system on until 6 months after the
 
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
original go live date to further
 
01:30:11.470 --> 01:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
exacerbate the issue AG was ultimately
 
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
overbill nearly
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
$40,000 with a less than Urgent Response
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
or correction from the utility I'm
 
01:30:20.510 --> 01:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
confident we can all agree on the
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
immense frustration caused by paying for
 
01:30:24.189 --> 01:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
an investment while it was an
 
01:30:27.550 --> 01:30:27.560 align:start position:0%
essentially inoperable especially so
 
01:30:30.430 --> 01:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
when you are overcharged again it is not
 
01:30:32.430 --> 01:30:32.440 align:start position:0%
the supply chain disruptions nor the
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
billing errors that are the fundamental
 
01:30:36.790 --> 01:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
problem just as it was not the
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
aforementioned cost discrepancies that
 
01:30:41.229 --> 01:30:41.239 align:start position:0%
caused our heartache simply put the
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
current system in place or lack thereof
 
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
makes positive initiatives such as
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
cleaned solar energy and uphill
 
01:30:51.229 --> 01:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
battle as you can see AG has been
 
01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
directly impacted by the insufficient CL
 
01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
ity misinformation and unpredictability
 
01:30:59.830 --> 01:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
involved in such a process but it is not
 
01:31:02.430 --> 01:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
for our own benefit that we primarily
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
plead this case implementing fair and
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
transparent interconnection procedures
 
01:31:09.550 --> 01:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
provide all New Hampshire citizens
 
01:31:12.030 --> 01:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
individuals and corporate entities alike
 
01:31:14.189 --> 01:31:14.199 align:start position:0%
a Level Playing Field to fully embrace
 
01:31:17.310 --> 01:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
the opportunities solar energy provides
 
01:31:19.709 --> 01:31:19.719 align:start position:0%
with that we respectfully asked this
 
01:31:22.229 --> 01:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
legislature to enable the Public
 
01:31:24.590 --> 01:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission to integr this
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
demonstration of equity for the
 
01:31:27.709 --> 01:31:27.719 align:start position:0%
betterment of New Hampshire's
 
01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
communities far and wide we appreciate
 
01:31:32.590 --> 01:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
your consideration of our perspective
 
01:31:35.709 --> 01:31:35.719 align:start position:0%
given our experience and we invite you
 
01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:38.800 align:start position:0%

01:31:41.639 --> 01:31:42.629 align:start position:0%
our operations in Penbrook at any time
thank

01:31:42.629 --> 01:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
you great thank you very
 
01:31:48.109 --> 01:31:48.119 align:start position:0%
much representative Carman you have a
 
01:31:48.119 --> 01:31:49.669 align:start position:0%
much representative Carman you have a
question

01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so uh the
 
01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
existing array that you have that's
 
01:31:59.910 --> 01:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
operational offsets 20% of your electric
 
01:32:01.629 --> 01:32:01.639 align:start position:0%
load more or less correct and you're
 
01:32:07.229 --> 01:32:07.239 align:start position:0%
looking to expand and and uh how much uh
 
01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
additional capacity uh would would the
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
expansion handle so thank you for the
 
01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
question so we are looking at right now
 
01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you've ever been to AG
 
01:32:21.790 --> 01:32:21.800 align:start position:0%
so we've got you know a warehouse an
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
office and a warehouse basically so
 
01:32:25.950 --> 01:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
there's a dry grocery warehouse and a
 
01:32:29.790 --> 01:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
refrigerated side both roughly the same
 
01:32:32.430 --> 01:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
size the dry grocery side of the
 
01:32:34.590 --> 01:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
warehouse is completely covered in solar
 
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
panels so we still have the whole other
 
01:32:39.310 --> 01:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
half of the building that we could put
 
01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
solar panels on and at the same time
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
we're looking to expand our current
 
01:32:46.470 --> 01:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
footprint we're outgrowing our 500,000
 
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
square feet right now so we've begun uh
 
01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
the process of expanding our warehouse
 
01:32:54.910 --> 01:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
here in Penbrook and it would be great
 
01:32:57.629 --> 01:32:57.639 align:start position:0%
to at the same time expand our solar
 
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
array um but unfortunately that's like I
 
01:33:03.629 --> 01:33:03.639 align:start position:0%
said previously an uphill battle right
 
01:33:03.639 --> 01:33:05.070 align:start position:0%
said previously an uphill battle right
now

01:33:05.070 --> 01:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:33:08.669 --> 01:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
so follow up okay follow up yeah thank
 
01:33:11.550 --> 01:33:11.560 align:start position:0%
you so it sounds like the expansion
 
01:33:15.149 --> 01:33:15.159 align:start position:0%
would be about another 20% or so of of
 
01:33:18.629 --> 01:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
your needs yeah there are other issue
 
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
issues involved that were this is a part
 
01:33:24.109 --> 01:33:24.119 align:start position:0%
of our challenges with solar net
 
01:33:27.109 --> 01:33:27.119 align:start position:0%
metering is also another right so so so
 
01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
my my real question is if if it's not
 
01:33:32.830 --> 01:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
even if it's not meeting 100% of your
 
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
needs then what's the problem with
 
01:33:37.390 --> 01:33:37.400 align:start position:0%
interconnecting shouldn't all those
 
01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
electrons just be going right into the
 
01:33:41.669 --> 01:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
building yeah we consume much more than
 
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
that though um and I think it was the
 
01:33:48.910 --> 01:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
problem was when we they're all running
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
now that one half of the building but at
 
01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
the time of installation a year ago
 
01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
for the previous testimony it was it was
 
01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
a challenge getting everything hooked up
 
01:34:02.910 --> 01:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
and it makes us hesitant to move forward
 
01:34:06.030 --> 01:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
with any additional
 
01:34:08.189 --> 01:34:08.199 align:start position:0%
projects if that and if that doesn't
 
01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
answer your question I can definitely go
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
back to the team and get back to you
 
01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
yeah okay we have eight more people who
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
would like to testify representative
 
01:34:19.149 --> 01:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
McGee has a question thank you I just
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask uh how long of a delay you
 
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
experienced uh thank you for question I
 
01:34:27.149 --> 01:34:27.159 align:start position:0%

months all righty I want to thank you
 
01:34:31.550 --> 01:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
for coming to testify to us this morning
 
01:34:35.390 --> 01:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
next I'll call on Kate T from New Leaf
 
01:34:37.709 --> 01:34:37.719 align:start position:0%

01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
the country and one of the key factors
 
01:36:24.109 --> 01:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
that we consider in deciding where to
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
invest is whether a state has a clear
 
01:36:28.830 --> 01:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
set of interconnection Standards to
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%

01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
extremely limited in our ability to move
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
projects forward due to the lack of
 
01:36:50.189 --> 01:36:50.199 align:start position:0%
access to information and Regulatory
 
01:36:53.189 --> 01:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
certainty of timelines and costs
 
01:36:55.709 --> 01:36:55.719 align:start position:0%
where're eager to invest more and to
 
01:36:57.790 --> 01:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
grow our business in New Hampshire but
 
01:36:59.950 --> 01:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
we're forced to focus our attention and
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
resources in other states where there's
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
a set of rules that both we and the
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
electric utilities can follow to ensure
 
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
an efficient interconnection
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
process Senate Bill 391 appears on its
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
face to be an obscure piece of technical
 
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
legislation but its impact is actually
 
01:37:20.229 --> 01:37:20.239 align:start position:0%
simple without this bill it will not be
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
possible for distributed generation
 
01:37:23.550 --> 01:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
companies to continue doing business
 
01:37:25.709 --> 01:37:25.719 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire or for New
 
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents and businesses to
 
01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
make their own energy choices a lack of
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
clear rules of the road leaves New Leaf
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
and other companies in limbo with no way
 
01:37:37.950 --> 01:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
to predict when our projects may be able
 
01:37:38.910 --> 01:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
to come
 
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
online there are many facets of project
 
01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
Development and Construction that make
 
01:37:47.950 --> 01:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
an extended lead time unfinanced project
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
considerations such as site control
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
permitting and revenue agreements
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
require a considerable amount of capital
 
01:37:57.109 --> 01:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
and resources to maintain and they also
 
01:37:59.629 --> 01:37:59.639 align:start position:0%
have finite terms that are subject to
 
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
expiration for that reason distribut
 
01:38:04.030 --> 01:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
generation companies are hesitant to
 
01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
expend time and resources on a project
 
01:38:09.229 --> 01:38:09.239 align:start position:0%
with uncertain viability and with other
 
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities exist with less risk and
 
01:38:15.229 --> 01:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
variability so for these reasons I urge
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
you to support Senate Bill 391 because
 
01:38:20.229 --> 01:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
without it New Hampshire will foreclose
 
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to strengthen its energy
 
01:38:24.910 --> 01:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
security and New Hampshire residents and
 
01:38:26.669 --> 01:38:26.679 align:start position:0%
businesses will be unable to make the
 
01:38:29.229 --> 01:38:29.239 align:start position:0%
energy choices that are best for them
 
01:38:30.629 --> 01:38:30.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the opportunity
 
01:38:32.470 --> 01:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
to testify today and for considering
 
01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
this critical
 
01:38:36.189 --> 01:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you for being here
 
01:38:38.350 --> 01:38:38.360 align:start position:0%
apologies again for mispronouncing your
 
01:38:41.229 --> 01:38:41.239 align:start position:0%
last name could you tell us are you
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
happy with Senate Bill 391 as
 
01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
written yes I think it's the key and
 
01:38:50.709 --> 01:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
most important thing here is for us to
 
01:38:53.390 --> 01:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
move forward with implementing a set of
 
01:38:56.229 --> 01:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
inter connection rules and standards um
 
01:38:59.470 --> 01:38:59.480 align:start position:0%
whether that's done by Doe or at the Pu
 
01:39:01.070 --> 01:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
I think we need to move forward with
 
01:39:02.910 --> 01:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
getting those standards in place and to
 
01:39:04.830 --> 01:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
have stakeholder engagement and
 
01:39:07.709 --> 01:39:07.719 align:start position:0%
establishment okay great representative
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
migy has a question thank you Mr chair
 
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you Miss to for taking my
 
01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
question um when I look at the bill as
 
01:39:18.629 --> 01:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
written in front of me uh starting on
 
01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
line seven uh the sentence starts the
 
01:39:24.109 --> 01:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
Draft rules shall include detailed
 
01:39:25.990 --> 01:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
applicability and eligibility
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
requirements in Provisions relating to
 
01:39:31.470 --> 01:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
engineering standards review processes
 
01:39:33.550 --> 01:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
timelines cost responsibilities
 
01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
information sharing and transparency and
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution that are aligned with
 
01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
National Best Practices including the IR
 
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
the interstate renewable energy
 
01:39:47.070 --> 01:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
council's 2023 model interconnection
 
01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
procedures in your experience is that
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
definition adequate for our Regulators
 
01:39:57.629 --> 01:39:57.639 align:start position:0%
to be able to um pull together a process
 
01:39:59.310 --> 01:39:59.320 align:start position:0%
be I don't know how much you know about
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
the IP
 
01:40:03.669 --> 01:40:03.679 align:start position:0%
20221 report that came out on December
 
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
5th that was the result of s sp262 in
 
01:40:10.149 --> 01:40:10.159 align:start position:0%
2022 which many of us participated in um
 
01:40:12.430 --> 01:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
so we've been trying to sort of get some
 
01:40:14.750 --> 01:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations for a while do you think
 
01:40:17.470 --> 01:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
that this language um is sufficient
 
01:40:18.990 --> 01:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
instruction because it sounds like we
 
01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
have a a pending amendment that has some
 
01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
very specific um uh try trying to sort
 
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
of jump to the solution rather than have
 
01:40:29.229 --> 01:40:29.239 align:start position:0%
a process do you think this will get us
 
01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
there I do think that that language is
 
01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
sufficient to get us there um although I
 
01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
do recognize what the other constituent
 
01:40:39.510 --> 01:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
said earlier today about um the for
 
01:40:41.950 --> 01:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
smaller facilities the potential of a
 
01:40:44.669 --> 01:40:44.679 align:start position:0%
differing process in Massachusetts there
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
are three different tracks that are
 
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
followed for interconnection and there's
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
a simplified process that's utilized for
 
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
smaller facilities um I am familiar with
 
01:40:56.669 --> 01:40:56.679 align:start position:0%
the process that was undergone prior to
 
01:40:58.510 --> 01:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
this and participated in it and I know
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
that there was discussion about looking
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
at both the interconnection rules in
 
01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts as well as the IRA model
 
01:41:06.830 --> 01:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
rules in considering what should be
 
01:41:08.990 --> 01:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
implemented in New Hampshire so I think
 
01:41:10.589 --> 01:41:10.599 align:start position:0%
based on the language that's included in
 
01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
the legislation um the process or
 
01:41:15.149 --> 01:41:15.159 align:start position:0%
investigation to set those standards
 
01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
would give an opportunity to consider
 
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
those separate tracks for
 
01:41:19.950 --> 01:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
interconnection and I have a followup
 
01:41:22.669 --> 01:41:22.679 align:start position:0%
sure followup and so the other part of
 
01:41:25.589 --> 01:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
the process seems to be that um we took
 
01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
out a timeline for turning around um
 
01:41:33.070 --> 01:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
these rules based on an objection from
 
01:41:35.229 --> 01:41:35.239 align:start position:0%
our largest utility I believe who also
 
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
does business in Massachusetts so are
 
01:41:40.430 --> 01:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
they currently privy to or they
 
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
currently required to uh abide by the
 
01:41:46.030 --> 01:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
rules that have been adopted in our
 
01:41:48.830 --> 01:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
neighboring state yes they so they
 
01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
already are functioning in another state
 
01:41:54.669 --> 01:41:54.679 align:start position:0%
with those um with rules yes absolutely
 
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has an interconnection
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
tariff and in that tariff there are
 
01:42:00.669 --> 01:42:00.679 align:start position:0%
timeline requirements for the
 
01:42:02.990 --> 01:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
interconnection process for all three of
 
01:42:05.189 --> 01:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
the processes the all three of the
 
01:42:07.950 --> 01:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
tracks included and eversource is one of
 
01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts Electric utilities is
 
01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
required to follow the interconnection
 
01:42:14.830 --> 01:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
Tariff okay thank you representative
 
01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
liwicki has a question uh thank you Mr
 
01:42:18.030 --> 01:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
question I see in the bill it says that
 
01:42:22.750 --> 01:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
uh any new employee positions required
 
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
to implement that this chapter shall be
 
01:42:25.589 --> 01:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
approved by the fiscal Committee of the
 
01:42:28.350 --> 01:42:28.360 align:start position:0%
general court um which implies that
 
01:42:29.950 --> 01:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
there should be a fiscal note here
 
01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
because this is going to be costing the
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money I also question how much
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
is this going to cost the utility
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
companies how many trucks how many
 
01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
employees are they going to be need to
 
01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
clear the backlog and to do all these
 
01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
interconnections because these are casss
 
01:42:47.390 --> 01:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
that uh will be borne not by the people
 
01:42:50.109 --> 01:42:50.119 align:start position:0%
who are being interconnected but by the
 
01:42:50.119 --> 01:42:51.950 align:start position:0%
who are being interconnected but by the
utility

01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
utility
 
01:42:54.589 --> 01:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
company um I there may be others here
 
01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
who are better suited to answer that
 
01:42:57.629 --> 01:42:57.639 align:start position:0%
question but I can tell you in my
 
01:43:00.270 --> 01:43:00.280 align:start position:0%
personal opinion there are already
 
01:43:02.030 --> 01:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
there's already an interconnection
 
01:43:04.830 --> 01:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
process for each of the utilities in New
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but it's at the utili
 
01:43:08.870 --> 01:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
discretion and so it doesn't have a set
 
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
timeline or regulatory certainty for
 
01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
timelines cost and process for both the
 
01:43:15.550 --> 01:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
customer and the utilities so the
 
01:43:18.510 --> 01:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
utilities have discretion and um this
 
01:43:20.030 --> 01:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
discretion is not being followed
 
01:43:22.750 --> 01:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
uniformly so having a process in place
 
01:43:25.109 --> 01:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
that's followed in my opinion shouldn't
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
incur significant additional costs to
 
01:43:31.790 --> 01:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:34.149 --> 01:43:34.159 align:start position:0%
state representative Thomas has a
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh and thank
 
01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question based on
 
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
earlier discussions are you concerned
 
01:43:43.709 --> 01:43:43.719 align:start position:0%
about um the apparent lack of timelines
 
01:43:47.589 --> 01:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
Bill yes I I it would be my preference
 
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
to have um a set timeline for
 
01:43:58.669 --> 01:43:58.679 align:start position:0%
implementation of the interconnection
 
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
process representative rol has a
 
01:44:03.430 --> 01:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman um it
 
01:44:07.109 --> 01:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're based on your former
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
position in Massachusetts you are
 
01:44:12.189 --> 01:44:12.199 align:start position:0%
ideally positioned perhaps to answer
 
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
this question what do you think would be
 
01:44:17.070 --> 01:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
a reasonable given given the fact that
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
our neighboring state and has these
 
01:44:22.149 --> 01:44:22.159 align:start position:0%
standards already in place and our
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
largest utility also operates in
 
01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts what would be a reasonable
 
01:44:29.550 --> 01:44:29.560 align:start position:0%
timeline for New Hampshire our
 
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
department of energy to develop to to
 
01:44:33.550 --> 01:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
run this process and given the fact that
 
01:44:35.629 --> 01:44:35.639 align:start position:0%
they already did an investig
 
01:44:37.870 --> 01:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
investigatory proceeding and got a lot
 
01:44:39.390 --> 01:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
of stakeholder input what would be a
 
01:44:41.629 --> 01:44:41.639 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount of time to give our
 
01:44:44.350 --> 01:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
department of energy to publish these
 
01:44:46.270 --> 01:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
interconnection standards and put them
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
in place sure I will certainly offer my
 
01:44:51.870 --> 01:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
opinion I do recognize that having
 
01:44:53.470 --> 01:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
worked at the department dep of Public
 
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
Utilities in Massachusetts there's of
 
01:44:57.629 --> 01:44:57.639 align:start position:0%
course um lack of staff and bandwidth
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
that could constrain the department of
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
energy but I think that six months would
 
01:45:03.070 --> 01:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
be a reasonable time considering there's
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
already been an investigation there are
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
model rules that are offered and we also
 
01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
have Massachusetts the neighboring state
 
01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
that has a set of rules that are um
 
01:45:15.270 --> 01:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
efficient thank
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no additional questions
 
01:45:20.109 --> 01:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
I want to thank you for being here
 
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:22.800 align:start position:0%

development at uh numerous sites in New
 
01:46:24.830 --> 01:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but as uh Kate toay just spoke
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
to it it is a challenging environment
 
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
here given the lack of rules um I want
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
to clarify one thing about the bill in
 
01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
case it caused any kind of confusion
 
01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
where it says the Pu rule
 
01:46:45.589 --> 01:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
900 I'm going to switch to my other
 
01:46:45.599 --> 01:46:46.669 align:start position:0%
900 I'm going to switch to my other
glasses

01:46:46.669 --> 01:46:46.679 align:start position:0%
glasses
 
01:46:52.350 --> 01:46:52.360 align:start position:0%
sorry uh PC rule 900 shall remain uh in
 
01:46:55.229 --> 01:46:55.239 align:start position:0%
effect until any rules adopted pursuant
 
01:46:57.149 --> 01:46:57.159 align:start position:0%
to this section become
 
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:07.109 --> 01:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
912a clarifies that pu 904 through
 
01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
9008 are only applicable to small
 
01:47:12.750 --> 01:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
customer generators and those are the
 
01:47:17.070 --> 01:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
sections of the 900 rules that relate to
 
01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
interconnection so the 900 rules only
 
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
have in it interconnection process and
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
procedures for 100 KW and smaller
 
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
facilities pu 91.0 TWD states
 
01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
interconnection of large net metering
 
01:47:37.149 --> 01:47:37.159 align:start position:0%
customer generators which is anything
 
01:47:39.149 --> 01:47:39.159 align:start position:0%
over 100
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
kilow shall be governed by each
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
utility's interconnection practices as
 
01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
set forth in its tariff filed with the
 
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
commission the PSNH eversource tariff
 
01:47:55.589 --> 01:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
filed with the commission has a section
 
01:47:58.589 --> 01:47:58.599 align:start position:0%
37 that doesn't say much of anything the
 
01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
only thing of of relevance it says is
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
for all other generating
 
01:48:05.390 --> 01:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
facilities meaning those that aren't
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
smaller than 100 the company must be
 
01:48:10.750 --> 01:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
contacted for site specific
 
01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:12.750 align:start position:0%
contacted for site specific
interconnection

01:48:12.750 --> 01:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
interconnection
 
01:48:15.109 --> 01:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
requirements prior to interconnecting
 
01:48:17.149 --> 01:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
the generating facility with the
 
01:48:17.159 --> 01:48:19.910 align:start position:0%
the generating facility with the
company's

01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:24.589 --> 01:48:24.599 align:start position:0%
facility now the company does have
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
distributed generator interconnection
 
01:48:31.470 --> 01:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
guidelines dated July 2019 on its
 
01:48:34.629 --> 01:48:34.639 align:start position:0%
website and I know because in
 
01:48:36.910 --> 01:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
my I should have mentioned prior to
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
working at a gilas I spent 30 years
 
01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
working at ever Source this is probably
 
01:48:43.589 --> 01:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
a key point and I spent the last 12
 
01:48:46.430 --> 01:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
years as the manager of the group that
 
01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
interconnects distributed
 
01:48:52.149 --> 01:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
generation so I wrote those guidelines
 
01:48:54.910 --> 01:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
the guidelines that are on the website I
 
01:49:00.350 --> 01:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
wrote almost um singlehandedly you know
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
on a Sunday morning in my living room I
 
01:49:05.950 --> 01:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
copied the Connecticut rules that were
 
01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
part of a a a a Pura uh proceeding in
 
01:49:13.229 --> 01:49:13.239 align:start position:0%
like 2015 that ever source's Connecticut
 
01:49:15.790 --> 01:49:15.800 align:start position:0%
affiliate had to live with I said well I
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
might as well make them close to my
 
01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:21.719 align:start position:0%
affiliate in Connecticut's rules as
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
possible but I tailored them somewhat by
 
01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
taking out the elements that I thought
 
01:49:30.109 --> 01:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
were a little Overkill were a little uh
 
01:49:32.950 --> 01:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
unnecessary administratively burdensome
 
01:49:36.189 --> 01:49:36.199 align:start position:0%
to eversource and I took out the vast
 
01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
majority of
 
01:49:41.229 --> 01:49:41.239 align:start position:0%
timelines that applied to eversource but
 
01:49:43.629 --> 01:49:43.639 align:start position:0%
I left in the rules the timelines that
 
01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
applied to developers you know you shall
 
01:49:49.310 --> 01:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
have 20 days to sign this and return it
 
01:49:51.950 --> 01:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
you'll have 30 days to send us a 25%
 
01:49:54.910 --> 01:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
deposit things like that so there are
 
01:49:57.990 --> 01:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines on their
 
01:50:00.430 --> 01:50:00.440 align:start position:0%
website they were emailed to staff
 
01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
members of the Pu in I don't know 2019
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
let's say 2020 but they were never
 
01:50:09.149 --> 01:50:09.159 align:start position:0%
officially filed with the Pu commission
 
01:50:11.470 --> 01:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
or subject of of a proceeding of any
 
01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
kind so I just wanted to clarify that to
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
the extent anyone
 
01:50:17.870 --> 01:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
believes there's not an urgency here
 
01:50:20.910 --> 01:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
because p900 already has
 
01:50:23.790 --> 01:50:23.800 align:start position:0%
rules there are not rules in
 
01:50:27.950 --> 01:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
p900 there's a document on eversource's
 
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
website um that is from my perspective
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
now as a developer um woefully
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
inadequate to control the process the
 
01:50:41.470 --> 01:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
process is much more uh important now
 
01:50:44.069 --> 01:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
that the volume of interconnection
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
applications has
 
01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
grown the system is being stressed and
 
01:50:53.669 --> 01:50:53.679 align:start position:0%
and rules become much more important
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
why do we need rules they provide a
 
01:50:58.750 --> 01:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
framework to control the orderly process
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
both the applicant and the utility have
 
01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for an efficient
 
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
process the rules create performance
 
01:51:09.069 --> 01:51:09.079 align:start position:0%
standards for the utilities and ideally
 
01:51:10.990 --> 01:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
would also contain data reporting
 
01:51:13.270 --> 01:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
requirements so that all stakeholders
 
01:51:16.629 --> 01:51:16.639 align:start position:0%
are kept upto-date about adherence to
 
01:51:16.639 --> 01:51:18.270 align:start position:0%
are kept upto-date about adherence to

getting work completed transparency is

critical data must be made available to

01:51:33.950 --> 01:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:37.069 --> 01:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
process Massachusetts has an amazing set
 
01:51:39.709 --> 01:51:39.719 align:start position:0%
of rules some very strict
 
01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
timelines Kate toay could could come
 
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
back up and and testify further on those
 
01:51:47.790 --> 01:51:47.800 align:start position:0%
there's even a very specific timeline
 
01:51:49.950 --> 01:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism in
 
01:51:52.669 --> 01:51:52.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and miraculously ever
 
01:51:54.870 --> 01:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
Source Mass I don't believe has ever
 
01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
failed a timeline even though if you
 
01:52:00.069 --> 01:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
talk to developers in Mass it's a
 
01:52:02.790 --> 01:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
nightmare 10x what it is in New
 
01:52:07.109 --> 01:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so be on guard that there are
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
ways even with rules to make them
 
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
ineffective so we have to make sure they
 
01:52:14.990 --> 01:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
have some
 
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
teeth without rules disputes devolve
 
01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
into finger pointing and second guessing
 
01:52:22.709 --> 01:52:22.719 align:start position:0%
the de developers are in a very very
 
01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
weak position to challenge any aspect of
 
01:52:27.709 --> 01:52:27.719 align:start position:0%
utility performance the utilities have
 
01:52:32.069 --> 01:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
almost complete control and can slow
 
01:52:35.709 --> 01:52:35.719 align:start position:0%
walk or even ignore
 
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
disagreements the most frustrating
 
01:52:39.709 --> 01:52:39.719 align:start position:0%
aspect of interconnection as you've
 
01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
heard this morning from a few
 
01:52:44.109 --> 01:52:44.119 align:start position:0%
folks is the inability to get questions
 
01:52:46.069 --> 01:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
resolved and complaints
 
01:52:48.270 --> 01:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
addressed based on my time with ever
 
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
Source I want to make it clear that the
 
01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
reasons for this are the lack of firm
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
regulatory rules that contain enforcable
 
01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:57.030 align:start position:0%
regulatory rules that contain enforcable
performance

01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
performance
 
01:52:59.550 --> 01:52:59.560 align:start position:0%
metrics and also the general lack of
 
01:53:02.910 --> 01:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
priority given within utilities I'll
 
01:53:05.430 --> 01:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
speak for eversource to the de
 
01:53:07.709 --> 01:53:07.719 align:start position:0%
eversource during my time there to the
 
01:53:10.069 --> 01:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
deer interconnection
 
01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
function employees that work in this
 
01:53:15.069 --> 01:53:15.079 align:start position:0%
area are very hardworking professional
 
01:53:17.109 --> 01:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
and dedicated to strong
 
01:53:20.910 --> 01:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
performance however keep in mind that de
 
01:53:24.510 --> 01:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
interconnection is a a nonprofit segment
 
01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
of the utility
 
01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
organization it is understandable that
 
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
utility Executives not the workers doing
 
01:53:37.390 --> 01:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
the hard work but the utility Executives
 
01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
do not devote significant effort or
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
resources or strategic thinking into
 
01:53:44.550 --> 01:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
improving this
 
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
function while not the subject of Senate
 
01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
Bill 391 I believe interconnection rules
 
01:53:53.390 --> 01:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
should involve either penalties for
 
01:53:56.589 --> 01:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
non-performance or better
 
01:54:00.030 --> 01:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
incentives to the utility for strong
 
01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
performance given a profit motivation
 
01:54:04.990 --> 01:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
the utilities will find a way to
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
expedite interconnections a perfect
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
example is eversource's worldclass
 
01:54:13.270 --> 01:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency organization that
 
01:54:15.310 --> 01:54:15.320 align:start position:0%
operates with a shareholder incentive
 
01:54:18.149 --> 01:54:18.159 align:start position:0%
mechanism for their
 
01:54:21.750 --> 01:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
performance regarding copil 391 the lack
 
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
of a deadline I in the for a rulem is
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
disappointing I I think it
 
01:54:30.750 --> 01:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
personally um with all due respect I
 
01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
think it looks bad that it doesn't have
 
01:54:36.030 --> 01:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
a timeline I think it hints at something
 
01:54:38.669 --> 01:54:38.679 align:start position:0%
nefarious I hate to be a conspiracy
 
01:54:41.069 --> 01:54:41.079 align:start position:0%
theorist but I don't even know if s SP
 
01:54:45.669 --> 01:54:45.679 align:start position:0%
391 is needed as written the doe could
 
01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
create a rulemaking now they could open
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
a docket for Ru making or they could not
 
01:54:52.589 --> 01:54:52.599 align:start position:0%
I believe they have the authority that
 
01:54:54.270 --> 01:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
pu has the authority so I don't know
 
01:54:56.950 --> 01:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
what sp sp 391 is doing other than
 
01:55:01.229 --> 01:55:01.239 align:start position:0%
saying open the proceeding within 60
 
01:55:04.830 --> 01:55:04.840 align:start position:0%
days I think it needs a
 
01:55:07.189 --> 01:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
deadline the doe has already had an
 
01:55:10.390 --> 01:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
investigatory proceeding IP 20
 
01:55:12.830 --> 01:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
22-01 they've collected a wide range of
 
01:55:15.069 --> 01:55:15.079 align:start position:0%
stakeholder input there was General
 
01:55:17.069 --> 01:55:17.079 align:start position:0%
consensus on the need for rules and
 
01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
standards these rules are needed quickly
 
01:55:22.069 --> 01:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
and they must be rules with teeth and
 
01:55:24.910 --> 01:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
the agency that enforces the rules needs
 
01:55:28.709 --> 01:55:28.719 align:start position:0%
to get engaged inure rule compliance and
 
01:55:31.750 --> 01:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
to resolve disputes large and
 
01:55:34.990 --> 01:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
small thank you and could you provide us
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
with uh any written testimony I could uh
 
01:55:41.189 --> 01:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
clean this up and and give this to you
 
01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
it's basically what I I essentially just
 
01:55:46.669 --> 01:55:46.679 align:start position:0%
read what I will send you if that's okay
 
01:55:48.669 --> 01:55:48.679 align:start position:0%
that would be fine we'd appreciate that
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure representative reels is
 
01:55:52.750 --> 01:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
going to want to know what you think
 
01:55:57.109 --> 01:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:59.470 --> 01:55:59.480 align:start position:0%
deadline thank you Mr chairman but
 
01:56:02.430 --> 01:56:02.440 align:start position:0%
actually that that wasn't the the the
 
01:56:05.069 --> 01:56:05.079 align:start position:0%
question I was going to ask um having
 
01:56:08.910 --> 01:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
asked that previously uh uh thank you Mr
 
01:56:11.709 --> 01:56:11.719 align:start position:0%
bre for being here and um again of
 
01:56:15.750 --> 01:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
course you would uh tell us tell us all
 
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh that you you know 30 years uh at
 
01:56:20.430 --> 01:56:20.440 align:start position:0%
eversource including the as you said the
 
01:56:22.910 --> 01:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
last 12 overseas
 
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
the group that that handled the
 
01:56:27.990 --> 01:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
interconnection process and
 
01:56:32.350 --> 01:56:32.360 align:start position:0%
um uh I I want to kind of ask some qu a
 
01:56:33.790 --> 01:56:33.800 align:start position:0%
question here if the chairman if you'll
 
01:56:36.030 --> 01:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
indulge me just I hope to illuminate a
 
01:56:39.910 --> 01:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
little bit this is a very complex topic
 
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
that we're discussing trying to require
 
01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
doe to publish rules for so I wanted to
 
01:56:48.189 --> 01:56:48.199 align:start position:0%
try to um illustrate it here for
 
01:56:50.950 --> 01:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
everyone's benefit um and so while we're
 
01:56:53.790 --> 01:56:53.800 align:start position:0%
just closing I before joining the
 
01:56:56.870 --> 01:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
legislature um I spent three and a half
 
01:57:00.589 --> 01:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
years um uh with revision energy uh
 
01:57:03.189 --> 01:57:03.199 align:start position:0%
selling commercial solar projects trying
 
01:57:06.270 --> 01:57:06.280 align:start position:0%
to sell commercial solar projects and so
 
01:57:08.030 --> 01:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
this interconnection we are familiar
 
01:57:09.550 --> 01:57:09.560 align:start position:0%
with your background could you just ask
 
01:57:10.990 --> 01:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
your question please yes yeah the
 
01:57:13.589 --> 01:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
interconnection process the big Bugaboo
 
01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
it would you what we're talking about
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
when once a developer submits a
 
01:57:18.639 --> 01:57:20.189 align:start position:0%
when once a developer submits a
interconnection

01:57:20.189 --> 01:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
interconnection
 
01:57:23.430 --> 01:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
application uh is is getting that thing
 
01:57:26.990 --> 01:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
called the system impact study
 
01:57:31.229 --> 01:57:31.239 align:start position:0%
done and as you described interestingly
 
01:57:34.750 --> 01:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
the way you wrote ever sources
 
01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
guidelines uh for such
 
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
um you
 
01:57:44.229 --> 01:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
um you took out the
 
01:57:46.510 --> 01:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
timelines that applicable to the
 
01:57:49.030 --> 01:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
utility while leaving them for their
 
01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:50.550 align:start position:0%
utility while leaving them for their
developers

01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
developers
 
01:57:53.830 --> 01:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
um would you that
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
it with respect to the system impact
 
01:57:58.229 --> 01:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
study the things that are most
 
01:57:59.870 --> 01:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
challenging now that you sit on the
 
01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
other side as a developer is one the
 
01:58:06.189 --> 01:58:06.199 align:start position:0%
lack of any standards for the time that
 
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
the utility has to conduct that
 
01:58:15.189 --> 01:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
study um the electrical the the clarity
 
01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the electrical engineering standards
 
01:58:23.149 --> 01:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
that apply to that study
 
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
as as they indicate the need or lack uh
 
01:58:31.669 --> 01:58:31.679 align:start position:0%
the need for any and the level of system
 
01:58:34.069 --> 01:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
upgrades upgrades to the Grid in order
 
01:58:34.079 --> 01:58:35.830 align:start position:0%
upgrades upgrades to the Grid in order
for

01:58:35.830 --> 01:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:58:39.790 --> 01:58:39.800 align:start position:0%
this um solar generation facility to
 
01:58:45.229 --> 01:58:45.239 align:start position:0%
connect and then finally the cost
 
01:58:48.629 --> 01:58:48.639 align:start position:0%
of any such upgrades that the utility
 
01:58:48.639 --> 01:58:50.350 align:start position:0%
of any such upgrades that the utility
ultimately

01:58:50.350 --> 01:58:50.360 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
01:58:52.629 --> 01:58:52.639 align:start position:0%
determines our require
 
01:58:55.149 --> 01:58:55.159 align:start position:0%
ired so like those three elements the
 
01:58:57.149 --> 01:58:57.159 align:start position:0%
time it takes what the engineering
 
01:59:00.990 --> 01:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
standards are and the cost uh my
 
01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
recollection was from the developer
 
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
standpoint it was like you applied for
 
01:59:06.629 --> 01:59:06.639 align:start position:0%
interconnection you kind of threw that
 
01:59:10.350 --> 01:59:10.360 align:start position:0%
over the wall the utility took it had it
 
01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
had it did it all itself and you waited
 
01:59:16.510 --> 01:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
and maybe that study came back within a
 
01:59:19.350 --> 01:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
year and it said okay you can
 
01:59:22.229 --> 01:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
interconnect but you're going to have to
 
01:59:24.629 --> 01:59:24.639 align:start position:0%
upgrade this this this and this and it's
 
01:59:26.709 --> 01:59:26.719 align:start position:0%
going to cost this this this and this
 
01:59:30.350 --> 01:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
and then that would just put the project
 
01:59:32.629 --> 01:59:32.639 align:start position:0%
totally over the edge in terms of
 
01:59:34.990 --> 01:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
economic viability is that what what
 
01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here in this
 
01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
interconnection you know this yeah
 
01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's basically the process
 
01:59:43.709 --> 01:59:43.719 align:start position:0%
yes appreciate the brevity of that
 
01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
answer yeah yeah okay seeing no further
 
01:59:49.149 --> 01:59:49.159 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee I want to
 
01:59:51.109 --> 01:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr lre and I would appreciate
 
01:59:53.950 --> 01:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
some written test testimony from you oh
 
01:59:56.030 --> 01:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't see representative MC
 
01:59:57.750 --> 01:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
Williams had her hand up thank you chair
 
02:00:00.550 --> 02:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
Bose um I I just want to ask a little
 
02:00:04.030 --> 02:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
bit more um about you mentioned
 
02:00:06.390 --> 02:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
incentives uh both on the eversource
 
02:00:07.910 --> 02:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
side and potentially on the developer
 
02:00:10.669 --> 02:00:10.679 align:start position:0%
side for Speed schedule um my
 
02:00:12.270 --> 02:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
background's in construction I'm very
 
02:00:15.229 --> 02:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
familiar with damages for delay and also
 
02:00:17.069 --> 02:00:17.079 align:start position:0%
Clauses that would provide an incentive
 
02:00:20.790 --> 02:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
for Speedy um completion on a timeline
 
02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
um do you have any experience with other
 
02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
states or other other situations where
 
02:00:27.229 --> 02:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
these have been applied either damages
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
or incentives uh for developer or
 
02:00:30.870 --> 02:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
utility because I think that that's
 
02:00:32.069 --> 02:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
something worth
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
exploring I think on the developer side
 
02:00:38.030 --> 02:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
the the damage is you know being removed
 
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
from the queue if you don't do what
 
02:00:42.069 --> 02:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to do you're typically
 
02:00:44.229 --> 02:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh removed from the process you have to
 
02:00:46.589 --> 02:00:46.599 align:start position:0%
start over
 
02:00:50.550 --> 02:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
um I can't say that I'm aware of a
 
02:00:52.430 --> 02:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
utility or a franchise
 
02:00:56.030 --> 02:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
area that says if utility interconnects
 
02:01:00.350 --> 02:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
you within X days you get x amount of
 
02:01:04.109 --> 02:01:04.119 align:start position:0%
shareholder incentives certainly such a
 
02:01:06.669 --> 02:01:06.679 align:start position:0%
process could be devised I believe
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency is somehow earns an
 
02:01:11.709 --> 02:01:11.719 align:start position:0%
incentive based on the amount of capital
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
they deploy of Energy Efficiency
 
02:01:16.629 --> 02:01:16.639 align:start position:0%
measures there could be something
 
02:01:21.109 --> 02:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
devised um what we have seen uh more uh
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
often is a concept
 
02:01:27.470 --> 02:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
whereby the
 
02:01:30.030 --> 02:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
utilities with all the interconnection
 
02:01:33.069 --> 02:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
required to put distributed generation
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of facilities that need to
 
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
be built circuits need to be upgraded
 
02:01:38.510 --> 02:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes in the extreme substations
 
02:01:41.030 --> 02:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
need to be upgraded uh protection and
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
control equipment needs to be upgraded
 
02:01:47.550 --> 02:01:47.560 align:start position:0%
and right now the distributed generators
 
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
in most franchise areas the rules say
 
02:01:52.669 --> 02:01:52.679 align:start position:0%
you pay for 100%
 
02:01:55.589 --> 02:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
even if you've built a brand you know if
 
02:01:59.030 --> 02:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
you've funded a brand new $5 million
 
02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
Transformer at a substation say um you
 
02:02:05.950 --> 02:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
could create rules it would be have to
 
02:02:09.310 --> 02:02:09.320 align:start position:0%
be in law that say uh maybe the
 
02:02:12.589 --> 02:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
developer pays a percentage of that
 
02:02:14.709 --> 02:02:14.719 align:start position:0%
based on some engineering technical
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
metrics but a percentage of that $5
 
02:02:21.030 --> 02:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
million investment has long-term
 
02:02:24.430 --> 02:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
benefits to eversource's customer as a
 
02:02:27.229 --> 02:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
whole and therefore that should be
 
02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
treated more like traditional utility
 
02:02:33.229 --> 02:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
investment for which the utilities earn
 
02:02:33.239 --> 02:02:34.830 align:start position:0%
investment for which the utilities earn
a

02:02:34.830 --> 02:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
profit that would speed them up as well
 
02:02:39.069 --> 02:02:39.079 align:start position:0%
if they thought for every million
 
02:02:41.550 --> 02:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of DG related
 
02:02:43.950 --> 02:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure upgrades we deploy over
 
02:02:46.589 --> 02:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
the next you know decades uh we're going
 
02:02:49.470 --> 02:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
to get a small chunk it's going to it's
 
02:02:51.270 --> 02:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
going to grease the skids and get things
 
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
moving so there there's a provisional
 
02:02:56.390 --> 02:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
process like that in Massachusetts and
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
and elsewhere they're looking into
 
02:03:00.750 --> 02:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
things like that thank you very
 
02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:03.719 align:start position:0%
much okay I want to thank you for being
 
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
here and that's very Illuminating
 
02:03:07.950 --> 02:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
testimony you provided next we'll hear
 
02:03:09.550 --> 02:03:09.560 align:start position:0%
from Rockingham County Commissioner
 
02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:10.830 align:start position:0%
from Rockingham County Commissioner
Brian

02:03:10.830 --> 02:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
Brian
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
chirichello The Honorable Brian
 
02:03:16.709 --> 02:03:16.719 align:start position:0%
chirichello welcome back good to see
 
02:03:19.510 --> 02:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman committee
 
02:03:21.950 --> 02:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
members for the record my name is Brian
 
02:03:23.830 --> 02:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
rello I'm the chairman of Rockingham
 
02:03:26.270 --> 02:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners second largest
 
02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
county in the
 
02:03:31.149 --> 02:03:31.159 align:start position:0%
state um I'm just going to give you a
 
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
quick background as to what Rockingham
 
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
countyy is doing and the issue that we
 
02:03:39.750 --> 02:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
had um so Rockingham County in in uh
 
02:03:42.430 --> 02:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
during covid times we received some
 
02:03:44.910 --> 02:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
federal dollars from the federal
 
02:03:47.910 --> 02:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
government and um that's allowing us to
 
02:03:53.470 --> 02:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
build a $77 million building to how my
 
02:03:56.709 --> 02:03:56.719 align:start position:0%
um Sheriff's Department um registry of
 
02:03:59.430 --> 02:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
deeds and my county attorney's office
 
02:04:02.149 --> 02:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
and at the time um we had a building
 
02:04:04.270 --> 02:04:04.280 align:start position:0%
committee that was looking at doing some
 
02:04:07.109 --> 02:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
solar arrays that would be on top of
 
02:04:07.119 --> 02:04:08.270 align:start position:0%
solar arrays that would be on top of
covered

02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
covered
 
02:04:12.470 --> 02:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
parking um once weeded that arpa money
 
02:04:14.709 --> 02:04:14.719 align:start position:0%
we decided that it would be better used
 
02:04:19.030 --> 02:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
if we could do um an actual solar array
 
02:04:21.510 --> 02:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
and so that's the approach that we took
 
02:04:23.629 --> 02:04:23.639 align:start position:0%
and and bear with me one
 
02:04:26.310 --> 02:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
second my eyes are not
 
02:04:30.310 --> 02:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
that well but
 
02:04:32.830 --> 02:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
um so we submitted an
 
02:04:36.430 --> 02:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
application um to interconnect a 3.25
 
02:04:40.549 --> 02:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
megawatt AC project 8,800 panels total
 
02:04:41.990 --> 02:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
and there was some talk about businesses
 
02:04:44.990 --> 02:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
doing smaller smaller um and I realize
 
02:04:46.830 --> 02:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit bigger but uh but
 
02:04:47.830 --> 02:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
it's still
 
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
important um so in November 2022 we
 
02:04:53.149 --> 02:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
received a system impact study agreement
 
02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
in May of 2023 6 months later the
 
02:04:58.030 --> 02:04:58.040 align:start position:0%
utility confirmed the study would begin
 
02:04:59.790 --> 02:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
on June
 
02:05:02.430 --> 02:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
14th we were told the study had a set
 
02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
timeline of 80 business days which our
 
02:05:07.709 --> 02:05:07.719 align:start position:0%
developer um the people that are doing
 
02:05:10.189 --> 02:05:10.199 align:start position:0%
our building are also um working with
 
02:05:11.910 --> 02:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
the solar
 
02:05:16.189 --> 02:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
piece um that it um it had slipped
 
02:05:17.990 --> 02:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
through the cracks we were told it was
 
02:05:19.830 --> 02:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
on course and the developer was told
 
02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
that they were working on it and then
 
02:05:23.589 --> 02:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
after 80 Days days we were told quote
 
02:05:25.189 --> 02:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
unquote slipped through the cracks and
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
the study process had not in fact not
 
02:05:30.189 --> 02:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
begun this was immensely challenging
 
02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
news to receive as the project had
 
02:05:33.910 --> 02:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise already been fully parented
 
02:05:35.229 --> 02:05:35.239 align:start position:0%
and we have already committed to
 
02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
specific project deadlines which became
 
02:05:40.629 --> 02:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
entirely Out Of Reach why is that
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
important we're using Opera money so if
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with Opera money it
 
02:05:46.910 --> 02:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
you've got a you've got to allocate it
 
02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
by a certain time and then you've got to
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
spend it so any delays would jeopardize
 
02:05:55.669 --> 02:05:55.679 align:start position:0%
um federal dollars being able to use for
 
02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
the for the solar arrays um I had heard
 
02:05:59.870 --> 02:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
one of the representativ mentioned talk
 
02:06:03.910 --> 02:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
about the rate payers um and I realized
 
02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
that businesses we're talking about
 
02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
solar but now we're talking about um
 
02:06:10.750 --> 02:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
government entities and one of the
 
02:06:13.910 --> 02:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
things that we're doing is the the the
 
02:06:15.750 --> 02:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
investment for the solar array in
 
02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County over the lifespan of
 
02:06:21.629 --> 02:06:21.639 align:start position:0%
30 years would return to the to the rate
 
02:06:24.629 --> 02:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
pays of Rockingham County $22.5
 
02:06:29.350 --> 02:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
million so this is this covers all of
 
02:06:31.790 --> 02:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
the Rockingham County complex's
 
02:06:34.589 --> 02:06:34.599 align:start position:0%
electricity our bill typically is around
 
02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
$600,000 a year between 600 and $700,000
 
02:06:39.270 --> 02:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
a year so it's
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
significant um but without any
 
02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
rules it's it's tough um and having
 
02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
rules set would would have made it a lot
 
02:06:51.310 --> 02:06:51.320 align:start position:0%
easier for us you know to be told that
 
02:06:55.790 --> 02:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
if was on on par uh and then to find out
 
02:06:58.950 --> 02:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
after the fact it was not uh is
 
02:07:00.910 --> 02:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
problematic so we're behind the
 
02:07:03.310 --> 02:07:03.320 align:start position:0%
eightball a little bit I mean I think
 
02:07:06.470 --> 02:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
we're still we can still manage it but I
 
02:07:08.149 --> 02:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
I think that rules need to be in place
 
02:07:11.350 --> 02:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
you've heard all the testimony here um
 
02:07:13.870 --> 02:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
and I think uh that this story needed to
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
be told because it's not just businesses
 
02:07:20.350 --> 02:07:20.360 align:start position:0%
it's also um municipalities um also
 
02:07:22.750 --> 02:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
really briefly I also wear a second hat
 
02:07:25.310 --> 02:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
I'm a town counselor in Derry and in
 
02:07:28.830 --> 02:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
Derry we did a PPA uh smaller array but
 
02:07:31.589 --> 02:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
same same thing um and that would have
 
02:07:36.350 --> 02:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
lowered our kilowatt um cost to 6 cents
 
02:07:36.360 --> 02:07:37.790 align:start position:0%
lowered our kilowatt um cost to 6 cents
per

02:07:37.790 --> 02:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
per
 
02:07:40.069 --> 02:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
kilowatt we had the same problem at the
 
02:07:43.669 --> 02:07:43.679 align:start position:0%
town of Derry um lack of communication
 
02:07:46.990 --> 02:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
and no no set rules so this needs to get
 
02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
fixed so um I'll end it there and I'm
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions that anyone
 
02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:52.669 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions that anyone
may

02:07:52.669 --> 02:07:52.679 align:start position:0%
may
 
02:07:56.350 --> 02:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
have okay thank you seeing no questions
 
02:07:57.950 --> 02:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
from the committee we'll move along and
 
02:08:00.149 --> 02:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
I'll call next on Sam Evans Brown of
 
02:08:03.310 --> 02:08:03.320 align:start position:0%
clean energy New Hampshire to give the
 
02:08:05.950 --> 02:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
committee his perspective on this
 
02:08:10.510 --> 02:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
legislation welcome back Mr Evans
 
02:08:13.069 --> 02:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chair members of the
 
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
committee um I'll try to be brief uh
 
02:08:18.390 --> 02:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
many of the points that that uh our
 
02:08:20.189 --> 02:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
members and our organization might make
 
02:08:22.229 --> 02:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
have been made already
 
02:08:24.390 --> 02:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
but I will say that in my opinion this
 
02:08:26.629 --> 02:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
is actually the biggest problem
 
02:08:29.790 --> 02:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
confronting the energy sector as as as
 
02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
it you know in
 
02:08:34.069 --> 02:08:34.079 align:start position:0%
2024 um these interconnection delays you
 
02:08:36.270 --> 02:08:36.280 align:start position:0%
know pick your generation type they
 
02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
impact every type of electrical
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
generator it just happens that what
 
02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
we're building right now is a lot of
 
02:08:42.109 --> 02:08:42.119 align:start position:0%
Renewables and so that's why you're
 
02:08:44.910 --> 02:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
hearing about solar a lot today um when
 
02:08:46.629 --> 02:08:46.639 align:start position:0%
I joined this organization three years
 
02:08:48.830 --> 02:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
ago this was the issue that I was pulled
 
02:08:50.990 --> 02:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
aside and talked to about before I even
 
02:08:53.229 --> 02:08:53.239 align:start position:0%
was on the payroll so this has been
 
02:08:55.470 --> 02:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
stewing for quite a while we attempted
 
02:08:57.470 --> 02:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
to solve this in 2022 with the passage
 
02:09:00.790 --> 02:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
of h s sp262 passed on a bipartisan
 
02:09:03.229 --> 02:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
basis um this bill initially was
 
02:09:04.910 --> 02:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
intended to be a placeholder for
 
02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations that would come out of
 
02:09:09.229 --> 02:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
the Doe's inter connection investigation
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
um and frankly we were somewhat
 
02:09:12.750 --> 02:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
underwhelmed by the results of that
 
02:09:14.990 --> 02:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
investigation and so we said instead
 
02:09:16.669 --> 02:09:16.679 align:start position:0%
maybe we should ask the the department
 
02:09:19.229 --> 02:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
to Simply go right ahead and start on
 
02:09:21.629 --> 02:09:21.639 align:start position:0%
rulemaking um stories like the ones you
 
02:09:24.589 --> 02:09:24.599 align:start position:0%
have heard are in my inbox every week um
 
02:09:26.790 --> 02:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
some that you may be would be interested
 
02:09:29.069 --> 02:09:29.079 align:start position:0%
to know about uh the The Glenn house the
 
02:09:30.750 --> 02:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
hotel at the base of Mount Washington
 
02:09:32.069 --> 02:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
has been waiting for a year for an
 
02:09:33.430 --> 02:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
interconnection study they've had to
 
02:09:35.750 --> 02:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
delay their project for an entire year
 
02:09:37.030 --> 02:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
town of Whitefield which is one of the
 
02:09:39.229 --> 02:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
smallest uh lowest income towns in the
 
02:09:40.950 --> 02:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
state one of the top 25 lowest income
 
02:09:43.350 --> 02:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
towns in the state purchased uh they
 
02:09:45.189 --> 02:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
received a USDA Grant to put solar on
 
02:09:47.709 --> 02:09:47.719 align:start position:0%
the roof of their Town buildings uh the
 
02:09:50.549 --> 02:09:50.559 align:start position:0%
town hall had their array installed in
 
02:09:52.549 --> 02:09:52.559 align:start position:0%
November and as of last week they were
 
02:09:54.030 --> 02:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
still waiting for permission to turn
 
02:09:58.149 --> 02:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
that array on um so so as I said they're
 
02:10:01.950 --> 02:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
these stories are quite prevalent um I
 
02:10:03.910 --> 02:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
would say I've heard some things that I
 
02:10:06.310 --> 02:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
I just want to address um developers
 
02:10:07.709 --> 02:10:07.719 align:start position:0%
already are paying the interconnection
 
02:10:09.189 --> 02:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
cost so the idea that this is going to
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
result in cost shift to customers that
 
02:10:14.030 --> 02:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
aren't benefiting from from the arrays I
 
02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
think is something that we can just put
 
02:10:17.510 --> 02:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
to rest that's not the case developers
 
02:10:20.790 --> 02:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
are paying these costs um however I
 
02:10:23.870 --> 02:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
would hesitate to put into statute a
 
02:10:26.390 --> 02:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
requirement that developers pay for all
 
02:10:28.709 --> 02:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
costs um there's quite a lot to be
 
02:10:30.830 --> 02:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
worked out in the question of cost
 
02:10:32.910 --> 02:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
allocation for interconnection costs and
 
02:10:35.589 --> 02:10:35.599 align:start position:0%
in particular uh in eversource territory
 
02:10:37.470 --> 02:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
there are interconnection upgrades that
 
02:10:40.549 --> 02:10:40.559 align:start position:0%
are being required that it's not clear
 
02:10:43.629 --> 02:10:43.639 align:start position:0%
how necessary they actually are uh in
 
02:10:44.950 --> 02:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
fact those types of upgrades are often
 
02:10:46.350 --> 02:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
not required in the service territories
 
02:10:48.910 --> 02:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
of other utilities and rate payers that
 
02:10:51.830 --> 02:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
are not benefici that are not uh uh
 
02:10:53.589 --> 02:10:53.599 align:start position:0%
paying for the the array and benefiting
 
02:10:55.350 --> 02:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
from the array are benefiting from those
 
02:10:57.750 --> 02:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
upgrades and so an example the classic
 
02:10:59.750 --> 02:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
one that I like to give was this idea of
 
02:11:02.589 --> 02:11:02.599 align:start position:0%
reclosers so developers are as to be pay
 
02:11:04.149 --> 02:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
are being asked to pay for the upgrades
 
02:11:07.830 --> 02:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
to multiple reclosers on on circuits uh
 
02:11:09.189 --> 02:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
what a recloser is is essentially a
 
02:11:10.549 --> 02:11:10.559 align:start position:0%
circuit breaker the skate controlled
 
02:11:11.709 --> 02:11:11.719 align:start position:0%
circuit breaker that can be operated
 
02:11:14.109 --> 02:11:14.119 align:start position:0%
from a control room uh when you swap out
 
02:11:17.149 --> 02:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
a fuse for for a a recloser all rate
 
02:11:19.229 --> 02:11:19.239 align:start position:0%
payers benefit from that because instead
 
02:11:21.629 --> 02:11:21.639 align:start position:0%
of having to roll a truck to handle an
 
02:11:23.510 --> 02:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
outage you can just hit a button and
 
02:11:25.750 --> 02:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
test to see if the recloser can reclose
 
02:11:28.589 --> 02:11:28.599 align:start position:0%
so this question of cost allocation is
 
02:11:30.790 --> 02:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of thorny issues in there
 
02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that there should be
 
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
it should be in statute that um that
 
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
that that that the developer shall
 
02:11:38.430 --> 02:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
always and forever pay for all of those
 
02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
upgrades I think that should be worked
 
02:11:41.229 --> 02:11:41.239 align:start position:0%
out in the working groups that were
 
02:11:43.069 --> 02:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
recommended in the doe
 
02:11:45.950 --> 02:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
investigation um one one other note you
 
02:11:47.629 --> 02:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
know we have heard that uh
 
02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
interconnection cues are are incredibly
 
02:11:52.069 --> 02:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
jammed up right now actually think that
 
02:11:54.750 --> 02:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
having rules and certainty would help
 
02:11:57.149 --> 02:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
with that problem because uh you know
 
02:11:59.950 --> 02:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
there are the there are plenty of actors
 
02:12:01.069 --> 02:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
in the space it is not just the
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
utilities that are part of the problem
 
02:12:04.149 --> 02:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
here too developers can be part of the
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
problem and one of the things that one
 
02:12:06.830 --> 02:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
of the behaviors that is somewhat
 
02:12:08.350 --> 02:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
problematic is that if you are a
 
02:12:10.830 --> 02:12:10.840 align:start position:0%
developer trying to build a project you
 
02:12:12.270 --> 02:12:12.280 align:start position:0%
one of the first things you do is you
 
02:12:13.669 --> 02:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
pitch that project into the
 
02:12:15.589 --> 02:12:15.599 align:start position:0%
interconnection queue because you know
 
02:12:17.430 --> 02:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
it's going to take perhaps a year or 18
 
02:12:19.589 --> 02:12:19.599 align:start position:0%
months to get your study back and so the
 
02:12:21.390 --> 02:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
so you're so there are sometimes
 
02:12:22.950 --> 02:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
speculative projects that are being put
 
02:12:24.270 --> 02:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
into these cues that are that are
 
02:12:26.830 --> 02:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
clogging them up and if we had certainty
 
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
timelines uh that uh I think there would
 
02:12:31.390 --> 02:12:31.400 align:start position:0%
be fewer of those speculative projects
 
02:12:33.750 --> 02:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
and we would have less guming up of The
 
02:12:37.149 --> 02:12:37.159 align:start position:0%
Works um uh I also concur that I think
 
02:12:39.430 --> 02:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
the deadlines should be reintroduced uh
 
02:12:42.750 --> 02:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
in an amendment um and I think uh that
 
02:12:44.830 --> 02:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
we need to to get some clarity in terms
 
02:12:46.870 --> 02:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
of administrative processes one one
 
02:12:49.549 --> 02:12:49.559 align:start position:0%
concern I have going forward is that uh
 
02:12:51.950 --> 02:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
as initially proposed this bill the ruem
 
02:12:54.430 --> 02:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
at the Public Utilities Commission which
 
02:12:57.030 --> 02:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
has fairly clearly defined
 
02:12:58.669 --> 02:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and processes that
 
02:13:00.589 --> 02:13:00.599 align:start position:0%
have been in exist for in existence for
 
02:13:02.910 --> 02:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
decades um the department of energy
 
02:13:04.870 --> 02:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
while uh doing a great job getting up
 
02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
and running is a still somewhat new
 
02:13:12.189 --> 02:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
entity uh and and I uh I I'm hesitant uh
 
02:13:14.189 --> 02:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
to see them to see them owning this
 
02:13:16.149 --> 02:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
rulemaking entirely I would prefer to
 
02:13:17.990 --> 02:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
see the department of energy draft the
 
02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
initial rules and then have the
 
02:13:21.750 --> 02:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
proceeding uh undertaken at the Public
 
02:13:23.149 --> 02:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission and so with that
 
02:13:24.750 --> 02:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
all end my
 
02:13:27.709 --> 02:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
comments thank you appreciate that
 
02:13:27.719 --> 02:13:30.910 align:start position:0%
comments thank you appreciate that
representative

02:13:30.910 --> 02:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:34.830 --> 02:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
um Ms has a question sorry Chris I threw
 
02:13:37.189 --> 02:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
a blank on your name for a minute I
 
02:13:38.350 --> 02:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
don't know what that
 
02:13:40.990 --> 02:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
says Thank you Mr chair um says I
 
02:13:43.069 --> 02:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
haven't seen you in a while yes and my
 
02:13:45.669 --> 02:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
apologies to the U committee for my uh
 
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
my lack of uh attention this morning um
 
02:13:52.629 --> 02:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
and um uh my apologies if this question
 
02:13:54.390 --> 02:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
has already been asked but I wanted to
 
02:13:58.310 --> 02:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
ask somebody so I picked on you um the
 
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
um the language um talks about um and
 
02:14:06.030 --> 02:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
it's in uh line six it talks about New
 
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's investor owned
 
02:14:11.149 --> 02:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
utilities um does that include the co-op
 
02:14:13.069 --> 02:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
is the Co-Op part part of this it does
 
02:14:14.549 --> 02:14:14.559 align:start position:0%
not so this does not include the co-op
 
02:14:16.589 --> 02:14:16.599 align:start position:0%
the co-op is not subject to pu
 
02:14:20.189 --> 02:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
regulation so uh the the the co-op would
 
02:14:22.030 --> 02:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
not be roped into this
 
02:14:25.549 --> 02:14:25.559 align:start position:0%
followup go ahead so does the do
 
02:14:27.589 --> 02:14:27.599 align:start position:0%
customers of the of the co-op experience
 
02:14:28.870 --> 02:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:14:32.189 --> 02:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
difficulties um that's uh that's an
 
02:14:35.830 --> 02:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
excellent question and I would happily
 
02:14:38.709 --> 02:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
sort of go back to go back to my emails
 
02:14:41.390 --> 02:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
and try to determine uh determine the
 
02:14:42.709 --> 02:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
degree to which Co-op customers are
 
02:14:44.990 --> 02:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
experiencing these problems um but I
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
actually wouldn't I wouldn't be able to
 
02:14:49.750 --> 02:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
say with great certainty uh how these
 
02:14:51.189 --> 02:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
problems are distributed utility by by
 
02:14:54.990 --> 02:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
utility with here on the stand on the
 
02:14:57.589 --> 02:14:57.599 align:start position:0%
spot representative MC Williams has a
 
02:15:00.549 --> 02:15:00.559 align:start position:0%
question thank you shose um and thank
 
02:15:03.149 --> 02:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
you Mr Evans Brown for testifying uh my
 
02:15:05.229 --> 02:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
question would be from a reasonableness
 
02:15:07.149 --> 02:15:07.159 align:start position:0%
perspective what do you think is a
 
02:15:09.629 --> 02:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
reasonable schedule um if we were to
 
02:15:11.149 --> 02:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
break this down into something that
 
02:15:13.549 --> 02:15:13.559 align:start position:0%
could be feasible uh following up on my
 
02:15:15.310 --> 02:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
previous question about pain share gain
 
02:15:17.470 --> 02:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
share penalties for delay versus
 
02:15:19.669 --> 02:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
incentives for completion on time what
 
02:15:22.510 --> 02:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
is a reasonable schedule in your
 
02:15:25.629 --> 02:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
opinion uh I would encourage you to ask
 
02:15:26.750 --> 02:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
that question to the Department of
 
02:15:31.149 --> 02:15:31.159 align:start position:0%
energy for for one I personally think
 
02:15:33.709 --> 02:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
the that the idea that we could have at
 
02:15:36.990 --> 02:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
least um you know a proceeding open and
 
02:15:41.109 --> 02:15:41.119 align:start position:0%
going by by Midsummer is is not out of
 
02:15:43.470 --> 02:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
the question um which I would argue
 
02:15:44.589 --> 02:15:44.599 align:start position:0%
would mean that we could have rules on
 
02:15:47.830 --> 02:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
the books by the end of the year but uh
 
02:15:50.030 --> 02:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh I am not the department of energy um
 
02:15:51.750 --> 02:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
I would I will look forward to working
 
02:15:54.310 --> 02:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with them to make the ru
 
02:15:56.510 --> 02:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
making process as smooth as possible but
 
02:15:58.189 --> 02:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
uh it'll be their staff that has to run
 
02:15:59.910 --> 02:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
it follow
 
02:16:03.069 --> 02:16:03.079 align:start position:0%
up yes follow up um thank you for that
 
02:16:05.390 --> 02:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of the legislation I I think to
 
02:16:07.310 --> 02:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
clarify my schedule question is really
 
02:16:09.350 --> 02:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
about how long should it take from a
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
developer submitting an application to
 
02:16:15.310 --> 02:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
doing the utility analysis to actually
 
02:16:17.390 --> 02:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
being able to install and then to
 
02:16:21.510 --> 02:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
connect in terms of schedule uh again i'
 
02:16:23.189 --> 02:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
I'd hesitate to shoot from the hip here
 
02:16:25.669 --> 02:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
on the stand I mean I I think that uh
 
02:16:29.229 --> 02:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
certain steps uh a 10-day requirement is
 
02:16:31.189 --> 02:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
is certainly reasonable so you pitch in
 
02:16:33.270 --> 02:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
an application getting response in 10
 
02:16:36.429 --> 02:16:36.439 align:start position:0%
days I think is is something that that
 
02:16:38.270 --> 02:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
um should be on the books the question
 
02:16:39.950 --> 02:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
of what is the timeline for things like
 
02:16:42.709 --> 02:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
a system interconnection study um I
 
02:16:44.589 --> 02:16:44.599 align:start position:0%
would imagine that that that'll be a
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
question that's heavily uh contested in
 
02:16:49.549 --> 02:16:49.559 align:start position:0%
the process of creating creating the
 
02:16:53.190 --> 02:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
rules and so um I would want to uh
 
02:16:55.469 --> 02:16:55.479 align:start position:0%
confer with our members to to see what
 
02:16:57.030 --> 02:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
other states are doing before before
 
02:16:59.549 --> 02:16:59.559 align:start position:0%
trying to to answer it on the stand but
 
02:17:03.429 --> 02:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
uh as things stand now it's
 
02:17:06.389 --> 02:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
untenable there's you have no idea how
 
02:17:08.429 --> 02:17:08.439 align:start position:0%
long these studies will take and they're
 
02:17:12.150 --> 02:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
often over a year with with simply radio
 
02:17:13.549 --> 02:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
silence as to when your system
 
02:17:16.110 --> 02:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
interconnection study might be completed
 
02:17:18.669 --> 02:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for that representative licki
 
02:17:20.349 --> 02:17:20.359 align:start position:0%
has a question um thank you Mr chairman
 
02:17:22.870 --> 02:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for my question you mentioned
 
02:17:25.110 --> 02:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh speculative applications coming up to
 
02:17:26.709 --> 02:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
works and it may already be the case
 
02:17:28.709 --> 02:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
that there is an application fee but if
 
02:17:30.950 --> 02:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
there's not would you be in favor of an
 
02:17:33.030 --> 02:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
application fee that would uh be
 
02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
forfeited if uh a an application were
 
02:17:38.669 --> 02:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
withdrawn uh I think I think yes is the
 
02:17:40.030 --> 02:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
answer there is already an application
 
02:17:44.270 --> 02:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:46.790 --> 02:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
helpful okay we have three more
 
02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:49.270 align:start position:0%
helpful okay we have three more
representative

02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
partial thank you chair and thank you
 
02:17:54.030 --> 02:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
again foring my question um was some
 
02:17:56.830 --> 02:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
point out earlier that the this um
 
02:17:59.790 --> 02:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
legislation is written doesn't do much
 
02:18:02.549 --> 02:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
that cannot already be done uh
 
02:18:05.150 --> 02:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
internally in the doe uh would you be in
 
02:18:08.990 --> 02:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
favor of some type of uh teeth such as a
 
02:18:11.509 --> 02:18:11.519 align:start position:0%
deadline added to the spills amended uh
 
02:18:12.990 --> 02:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
yes I would be in favor of a deadline
 
02:18:15.230 --> 02:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank
 
02:18:17.349 --> 02:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
you okay we have four more people who
 
02:18:18.910 --> 02:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
would like to testify so I want to thank
 
02:18:20.750 --> 02:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr Evans Brown for being here and
 
02:18:23.709 --> 02:18:23.719 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call next on Dan
 
02:18:28.389 --> 02:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
Y no I believe it is or I may be wrong
 
02:18:32.030 --> 02:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
about that but Dan you can um clarify
 
02:18:34.589 --> 02:18:34.599 align:start position:0%
that when you get in in the chair thank
 
02:18:36.349 --> 02:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
you andcome Harington like Harrington
 
02:18:38.870 --> 02:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
but with a y or you can say yarington
 
02:18:41.790 --> 02:18:41.800 align:start position:0%
could prefer uh the pirate pronunciation
 
02:18:45.270 --> 02:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
okay so like representative Herington um
 
02:18:46.270 --> 02:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like there's enough thank
 
02:18:47.990 --> 02:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you members of the
 
02:18:50.270 --> 02:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
committee um I'm just representing
 
02:18:52.110 --> 02:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
unlike the folks who are representing
 
02:18:54.230 --> 02:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
utilities and other things and uh solar
 
02:18:55.629 --> 02:18:55.639 align:start position:0%
companies I'm just representing myself
 
02:18:57.589 --> 02:18:57.599 align:start position:0%
and my family here so thank you very
 
02:18:58.990 --> 02:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
much you should each have a copy of this
 
02:19:01.230 --> 02:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
I printed out and gave to you um this is
 
02:19:02.990 --> 02:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
just on behalf of myself my wife Sarah
 
02:19:05.150 --> 02:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
and our three kids Logan Malcolm and
 
02:19:07.629 --> 02:19:07.639 align:start position:0%
Owen we live in London are New Hampshire
 
02:19:09.150 --> 02:19:09.160 align:start position:0%
um we are fortunate enough to have a
 
02:19:11.150 --> 02:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
very nice house that we can put solar on
 
02:19:13.709 --> 02:19:13.719 align:start position:0%
and we invested in that over the years
 
02:19:15.910 --> 02:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
um the gist of my testimony and you can
 
02:19:17.230 --> 02:19:17.240 align:start position:0%
read through this at your leisure so
 
02:19:19.870 --> 02:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
I'll try and keep it brief is we've done
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
a several array we did one small array
 
02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:23.599 align:start position:0%
when we started and then we added them
 
02:19:25.389 --> 02:19:25.399 align:start position:0%
recently so the perspective that I'm
 
02:19:28.709 --> 02:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
giving here is in the past was a lot
 
02:19:31.030 --> 02:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
easier and some's happened in the last
 
02:19:32.589 --> 02:19:32.599 align:start position:0%
like five six years that's made it a lot
 
02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
harder and we should not have to stand
 
02:19:36.190 --> 02:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
for this kind of bureaucracy when we
 
02:19:38.270 --> 02:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
decide we want to invest in something
 
02:19:40.270 --> 02:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
these are very basic things I mean we're
 
02:19:41.589 --> 02:19:41.599 align:start position:0%
obviously not talking about over a 100
 
02:19:43.629 --> 02:19:43.639 align:start position:0%
Megabots we're well under that for our
 
02:19:46.349 --> 02:19:46.359 align:start position:0%
home but this does affect homeowners and
 
02:19:48.509 --> 02:19:48.519 align:start position:0%
just residents in addition to businesses
 
02:19:50.750 --> 02:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
I'm uh I I have my own business as well
 
02:19:53.469 --> 02:19:53.479 align:start position:0%
so I'm very um understanding of the
 
02:19:55.870 --> 02:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
challenges there but this affects
 
02:19:57.550 --> 02:19:57.560 align:start position:0%
families if we say we want to it's the
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
same challenge we want to invest in our
 
02:20:01.750 --> 02:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
Solar we want to invest in stable energy
 
02:20:03.150 --> 02:20:03.160 align:start position:0%
so that we can help ourselves and our
 
02:20:05.270 --> 02:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
neighbors help stabilize the grid um
 
02:20:07.270 --> 02:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
which is better for everybody uh that's
 
02:20:09.550 --> 02:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
the gist of my testimony here is that
 
02:20:11.150 --> 02:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
it's taken way too long in our case it
 
02:20:13.270 --> 02:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
was about four or five months we lost an
 
02:20:16.349 --> 02:20:16.359 align:start position:0%
entire kind of prime summer uh you know
 
02:20:19.510 --> 02:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
Generation season and um you can read
 
02:20:21.349 --> 02:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
all the details in my testimony here I
 
02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
kept it short but I shouldn't have to
 
02:20:24.550 --> 02:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
send a 100 emails and make dozens of
 
02:20:26.469 --> 02:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
phone calls to get this done we didn't
 
02:20:28.670 --> 02:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
have to in the past and it's gotten
 
02:20:30.870 --> 02:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
worse as this has developed I assume
 
02:20:33.030 --> 02:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
based on the volume of you know new
 
02:20:35.349 --> 02:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
developments so um I'm happy to answer
 
02:20:36.750 --> 02:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
any questions like I said you're welcome
 
02:20:39.950 --> 02:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
to read this over uh at your leisure but
 
02:20:42.950 --> 02:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
um this this phrase here uh is really
 
02:20:45.030 --> 02:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
key we moved my family here moved to New
 
02:20:46.830 --> 02:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in 2003 so we've been here 20
 
02:20:49.070 --> 02:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
years now and we relish our ability to
 
02:20:51.150 --> 02:20:51.160 align:start position:0%
live free we want to be free of outdated
 
02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
and onerous regulations free of sticky
 
02:20:54.910 --> 02:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
red tape and free of overly complex
 
02:20:57.030 --> 02:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
barriers to the responsible exercise of
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
our personal property rights if we
 
02:21:01.270 --> 02:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
choose to invest in solar we want that
 
02:21:03.750 --> 02:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
to be a reasonable process so whatever
 
02:21:06.030 --> 02:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
we can do towards that end that's our
 
02:21:08.309 --> 02:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
goal okay thank you very much
 
02:21:10.110 --> 02:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
representative Corman needs to ask you a
 
02:21:12.510 --> 02:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
question though sure thank you Mr
 
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
question uh so I just want to clarify
 
02:21:17.870 --> 02:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
you're talking about relatively small
 
02:21:19.910 --> 02:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
residential and that it took you several
 
02:21:22.750 --> 02:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
months and with which utility uh this is
 
02:21:25.070 --> 02:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
with eversource is our local utility and
 
02:21:27.030 --> 02:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
um we had done several arrays in the
 
02:21:29.070 --> 02:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
past small arrays I think our total it
 
02:21:32.030 --> 02:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
was like 10 mega 10 kilowatts I guess I
 
02:21:34.030 --> 02:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
think our total is like 38 we but we've
 
02:21:35.389 --> 02:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
done this over many years and we've
 
02:21:37.309 --> 02:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
worked with uh the same company each
 
02:21:39.150 --> 02:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
time to do the install so I don't think
 
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
the issue is there I think there's just
 
02:21:43.309 --> 02:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
you know something wrong in the system I
 
02:21:45.030 --> 02:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
much wiser heads than I have testified
 
02:21:47.070 --> 02:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
it here today and I just want to provide
 
02:21:49.309 --> 02:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
the uh perspective that this does affect
 
02:21:51.630 --> 02:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
just everyday day-to-day payers you know
 
02:21:52.670 --> 02:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
that's a whole bunch of money that's
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
just sitting on my roof that I don't get
 
02:21:57.389 --> 02:21:57.399 align:start position:0%
to recoup and that's very frustrating so
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
it does make a difference this isn't
 
02:22:01.150 --> 02:22:01.160 align:start position:0%
rocket science it's some kind of science
 
02:22:02.790 --> 02:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
but it's not rocket science we should be
 
02:22:04.429 --> 02:22:04.439 align:start position:0%
able to have rules and they should be
 
02:22:06.190 --> 02:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
simple and clear and be able to move
 
02:22:08.349 --> 02:22:08.359 align:start position:0%
these things forward quickly thank you
 
02:22:11.230 --> 02:22:11.240 align:start position:0%
Mr yarington okay representative Mick
 
02:22:13.630 --> 02:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
Williams do you have to ask a question
 
02:22:15.990 --> 02:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
really quick okay um considering your
 
02:22:18.070 --> 02:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
position is as a individual and it's for
 
02:22:19.790 --> 02:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
residential solar do you believe there
 
02:22:21.510 --> 02:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
should be two different tracks for
 
02:22:23.910 --> 02:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
smaller versus larger array installation
 
02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:24.750 align:start position:0%
smaller versus larger array installation
and

02:22:24.750 --> 02:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:22:26.750 --> 02:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
timelines uh it sounds like there may
 
02:22:28.790 --> 02:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
already be that and I not as familiar
 
02:22:30.030 --> 02:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
with all the current rules and
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
regulations but that makes sense to me
 
02:22:33.870 --> 02:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
that there's you know up to 100 under
 
02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
100 whatever that is um whatever is
 
02:22:38.469 --> 02:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
reasonable and like I said it just has
 
02:22:40.990 --> 02:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
to be a firm process like my day job is
 
02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
I make board games we know about writing
 
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
clear rules and there's nothing more
 
02:22:46.030 --> 02:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
frustrating than like this is what the
 
02:22:47.590 --> 02:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
rules say or if the rules just don't say
 
02:22:49.790 --> 02:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
anything and if I say this is the rules
 
02:22:52.030 --> 02:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
you need to follow the damn rules like
 
02:22:53.670 --> 02:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
that's what the rules are there for so
 
02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
it sounds like we have a mess of a rule
 
02:22:56.230 --> 02:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
book here and we need to make a better
 
02:22:59.110 --> 02:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
rule book thank you all right thank you
 
02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
very much Mr Errington appreciate your
 
02:23:02.469 --> 02:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
testimony here this morning thank you
 
02:23:04.510 --> 02:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
all next I'd like to call on Lindsay
 
02:23:07.150 --> 02:23:07.160 align:start position:0%
bergoin of revision energy and Miss
 
02:23:10.870 --> 02:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
beroy I'd like you to uh keep your
 
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
testimony as brief as possible we need
 
02:23:16.750 --> 02:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
to get out of here
 
02:23:19.349 --> 02:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
um this hearing has gone on quite long
 
02:23:22.349 --> 02:23:22.359 align:start position:0%
so we have understand the issue so just
 
02:23:24.429 --> 02:23:24.439 align:start position:0%
give us any new information that you
 
02:23:26.950 --> 02:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
have that can make it easier for us to
 
02:23:29.269 --> 02:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
figure out what to do sure thank you
 
02:23:31.070 --> 02:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
chairman good to see you all uh my name
 
02:23:32.630 --> 02:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
is Lindsay berin I serve as the Director
 
02:23:33.990 --> 02:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
of policy and government Affairs for
 
02:23:36.590 --> 02:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
revision energy um we've been installing
 
02:23:38.349 --> 02:23:38.359 align:start position:0%
interconnecting solar in the state since
 
02:23:41.910 --> 02:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
2009 and dare I say may have um we
 
02:23:43.030 --> 02:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
suspect we may have filed an
 
02:23:44.630 --> 02:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
interconnected more systems in the state
 
02:23:46.830 --> 02:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
than perhaps anyone else so um I am
 
02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
actually not going to speak on the
 
02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
policy topic today and instead um turn
 
02:23:51.510 --> 02:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
it over to my colleague Megan anen who's
 
02:23:52.750 --> 02:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
here to speak a little bit about her
 
02:23:54.830 --> 02:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
experience in the field um submitting
 
02:23:56.750 --> 02:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
these applications and we will keep that
 
02:23:59.030 --> 02:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
brief um and then my written comments
 
02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
cover more of our policy talking
 
02:24:04.110 --> 02:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
points okay so we understand that there
 
02:24:06.990 --> 02:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
are delays in the process we get that
 
02:24:09.070 --> 02:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
we've heard it multiple times so you
 
02:24:11.590 --> 02:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
don't need to repeat that message just
 
02:24:13.389 --> 02:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
give us information that we can use to
 
02:24:15.190 --> 02:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
figure out a solution thank
 
02:24:17.990 --> 02:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
you understood uh my name is Megan Yulan
 
02:24:20.030 --> 02:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
I serve as a project developer for
 
02:24:21.590 --> 02:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
revision energy where I have worked in
 
02:24:23.110 --> 02:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
Brentwood for the past eight and a half
 
02:24:24.790 --> 02:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
years I've held roles where I was
 
02:24:26.429 --> 02:24:26.439 align:start position:0%
responsible for filing and managing
 
02:24:28.030 --> 02:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
interconnection applications for
 
02:24:29.510 --> 02:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
residential commercial and Municipal
 
02:24:31.469 --> 02:24:31.479 align:start position:0%
customers and overseeing the development
 
02:24:33.550 --> 02:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
of around 200 projects a year today I
 
02:24:34.990 --> 02:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
managed the interconnection process for
 
02:24:37.710 --> 02:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
commercial and Municipal projects 50kw
 
02:24:41.190 --> 02:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
to 5 megawatts EC o
 
02:24:45.429 --> 02:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
apologies um I guess my testimony today
 
02:24:47.190 --> 02:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
is to illustrate a couple of examples I
 
02:24:49.790 --> 02:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
can expound upon what uh Mr yarington
 
02:24:52.389 --> 02:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
provided for the residential customers
 
02:24:54.269 --> 02:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
um the lack of comprehensive
 
02:24:55.790 --> 02:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
interconnection rules has been readily
 
02:24:57.990 --> 02:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
apparent throughout my work residential
 
02:24:59.670 --> 02:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
customers are waiting months to turn on
 
02:25:01.750 --> 02:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
their systems creating challenges where
 
02:25:03.110 --> 02:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
when they are required to make loan
 
02:25:05.190 --> 02:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
payments and pay electricity bills while
 
02:25:07.309 --> 02:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
the system sits idle on their roof
 
02:25:08.830 --> 02:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
recently in eversource territory
 
02:25:10.150 --> 02:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
customers experienced an average
 
02:25:12.349 --> 02:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
timeline of 17 to 18 business days from
 
02:25:13.990 --> 02:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
submission of closeout documentation to
 
02:25:15.790 --> 02:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
permission to operate with times where
 
02:25:18.389 --> 02:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
it Spike to over 40 days so imagine
 
02:25:19.870 --> 02:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
installing a solar system and then being
 
02:25:21.070 --> 02:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
told you must must wait nearly eight
 
02:25:23.070 --> 02:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
weeks to turn turn it on this makes it
 
02:25:24.590 --> 02:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult to give customers
 
02:25:27.550 --> 02:25:27.560 align:start position:0%
realistic expectations effers has
 
02:25:28.990 --> 02:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
significantly improved residential
 
02:25:30.670 --> 02:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
timelines with new software and while we
 
02:25:32.349 --> 02:25:32.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate those efforts our state's
 
02:25:34.110 --> 02:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
utility customers deserve as you have
 
02:25:35.790 --> 02:25:35.800 align:start position:0%
heard equal accountabilities across all
 
02:25:37.710 --> 02:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
utilities for all project sizes and with
 
02:25:39.550 --> 02:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
the assurance that the processes won't
 
02:25:40.990 --> 02:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
change and dispute resolution is
 
02:25:43.389 --> 02:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
available should things go wrong for
 
02:25:45.550 --> 02:25:45.560 align:start position:0%
larger customers the lack of rules means
 
02:25:47.309 --> 02:25:47.319 align:start position:0%
they are waiting months or even years to
 
02:25:48.630 --> 02:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
be able to determine whether the project
 
02:25:51.110 --> 02:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
can safely interconnect a few examples
 
02:25:52.950 --> 02:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to provide to you today
 
02:25:56.670 --> 02:25:56.680 align:start position:0%
illustrate this um in 2022 a key
 
02:25:58.670 --> 02:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
nonprofit applied for an interconnection
 
02:26:01.950 --> 02:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
of a 260 kwac project received their
 
02:26:03.870 --> 02:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
system impact study agreement and then
 
02:26:05.429 --> 02:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
their interconnection agreement by April
 
02:26:08.469 --> 02:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
2023 total of five months more recently
 
02:26:11.030 --> 02:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
a Manchester business applied for a
 
02:26:14.190 --> 02:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
project half that size in June of 2023
 
02:26:16.790 --> 02:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
and we were told just this past month
 
02:26:18.389 --> 02:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
that the system impact study won't begin
 
02:26:21.389 --> 02:26:21.399 align:start position:0%
until April 2025 which is 23 months
 
02:26:23.230 --> 02:26:23.240 align:start position:0%
later and doesn't include the timeline
 
02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
for the study itself which typically
 
02:26:27.990 --> 02:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
takes 4 to 6 months making this a 27 to
 
02:26:30.950 --> 02:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
29 month timeline this is not a onetime
 
02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
occurrence timelines for these projects
 
02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
above 100 kwac have recently increased
 
02:26:37.550 --> 02:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
exponentially and these study start
 
02:26:39.630 --> 02:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
estimates are on average 22 to 26 months
 
02:26:40.990 --> 02:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
after the application
 
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
date uh I think what is new information
 
02:26:46.150 --> 02:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
here is that this is um not just on the
 
02:26:47.590 --> 02:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
front end we experien these delays on
 
02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
the close out side as well we have 60
 
02:26:53.550 --> 02:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
kwac Municipal project in Rochester we
 
02:26:55.230 --> 02:26:55.240 align:start position:0%
submitted its closeout documentation in
 
02:26:56.990 --> 02:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
mid December and we have spent the past
 
02:26:58.830 --> 02:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
three months inquiring when the customer
 
02:27:00.670 --> 02:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
will receive their net meter Swap and
 
02:27:02.790 --> 02:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
permission to operate to no avail so we
 
02:27:04.389 --> 02:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
can't give the city any expectations of
 
02:27:07.429 --> 02:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
when they'll be able to operate their
 
02:27:10.030 --> 02:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
system I think for those reasons um we
 
02:27:12.030 --> 02:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
do seek a role making at the puc we
 
02:27:14.030 --> 02:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
think that will meet the goals of sp262
 
02:27:15.910 --> 02:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of providing timely cost
 
02:27:16.830 --> 02:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
effective and predictable
 
02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
interconnection standards um there are
 
02:27:20.349 --> 02:27:20.359 align:start position:0%
really great robust um model
 
02:27:21.710 --> 02:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
interconnection procedures out there
 
02:27:23.870 --> 02:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
from both FK and IR um that can be
 
02:27:25.070 --> 02:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
utilized which means New Hampshire
 
02:27:26.429 --> 02:27:26.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to start from scratch and
 
02:27:28.030 --> 02:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
can customize those and build upon the
 
02:27:30.870 --> 02:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
Doe's investigation um we agree with the
 
02:27:34.269 --> 02:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
comments on timelines um and in fact uh
 
02:27:35.910 --> 02:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
the model interconnection procedures of
 
02:27:38.190 --> 02:27:38.200 align:start position:0%
of both entities um outline you know
 
02:27:39.790 --> 02:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
different types of project size level
 
02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
one through four I think those have been
 
02:27:43.070 --> 02:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
renamed um recently but what are
 
02:27:45.710 --> 02:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate timelines for um folks
 
02:27:47.269 --> 02:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
hearing back from utilities for each of
 
02:27:50.870 --> 02:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
those size um uh kind of categories if
 
02:27:53.389 --> 02:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
you will so thank you great thank you we
 
02:27:56.950 --> 02:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate you guys being here all right
 
02:27:58.870 --> 02:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question for
 
02:28:01.110 --> 02:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh Mr chair and thank you
 
02:28:03.309 --> 02:28:03.319 align:start position:0%
uh this is probably from Miss beroy um
 
02:28:05.110 --> 02:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
and you do call for the for this Ru
 
02:28:06.870 --> 02:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
making to be carried out at the Pu and
 
02:28:09.830 --> 02:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
the and the the uh the legislation we
 
02:28:11.510 --> 02:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
have is is calling for that to be
 
02:28:12.790 --> 02:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
carried out at the department of energy
 
02:28:14.910 --> 02:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
so can you just elaborate on what you
 
02:28:16.950 --> 02:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
think the difference between those two
 
02:28:18.630 --> 02:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
bodies would be in terms of the rul
 
02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
making yes um for sure and I think as
 
02:28:22.830 --> 02:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
you may note the original legislation
 
02:28:25.030 --> 02:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
did include um the Pu being the
 
02:28:26.830 --> 02:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
authoritative body in that regard I
 
02:28:28.630 --> 02:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
think it's the the pu's role to regulate
 
02:28:30.469 --> 02:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
utilities and this really is utility
 
02:28:32.030 --> 02:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
regulation um in terms of
 
02:28:33.349 --> 02:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
interconnection so we think that's the
 
02:28:35.190 --> 02:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
most appropriate body we think it would
 
02:28:37.590 --> 02:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
be great for doe to build upon the
 
02:28:39.150 --> 02:28:39.160 align:start position:0%
investigation that they did and draft a
 
02:28:40.830 --> 02:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
rule and then submit it to the Pu for
 
02:28:43.710 --> 02:28:43.720 align:start position:0%
the rul making um to ensure a process in
 
02:28:44.950 --> 02:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
which we can all
 
02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:46.790 align:start position:0%
which we can all
engage

02:28:46.790 --> 02:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
engage
 
02:28:49.269 --> 02:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
thanks okay seeing no further questions
 
02:28:52.550 --> 02:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
we've got two uh folks to go both
 
02:28:54.590 --> 02:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
probably have significant things to say
 
02:28:58.429 --> 02:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
to us so we'll hear first from Michael
 
02:29:00.910 --> 02:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
Lata of eversource and then we'll follow
 
02:29:03.429 --> 02:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
that up with Josh Elliott from the
 
02:29:16.630 --> 02:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
energy good afternoon uh Michael Lata
 
02:29:21.870 --> 02:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
repres presenting eversource energy
 
02:29:23.750 --> 02:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
02:29:26.910 --> 02:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
before you today and uh provide uh a
 
02:29:29.269 --> 02:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
little bit of the utility perspective um
 
02:29:32.950 --> 02:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
and our experience with uh de
 
02:29:36.630 --> 02:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
interconnection uh process uh first and
 
02:29:38.550 --> 02:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
foremost I I want to make it clear that
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
eversource supports the development of a
 
02:29:45.030 --> 02:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
Statewide de interconnection standard uh
 
02:29:46.830 --> 02:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
that was our testimony in the Senate
 
02:29:48.710 --> 02:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
we've been consistent uh with that
 
02:29:51.550 --> 02:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
position throughout we fully engaged in
 
02:29:54.389 --> 02:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
the uh doe investigation that's been
 
02:29:58.349 --> 02:29:58.359 align:start position:0%
referenced several times uh and uh would
 
02:30:01.790 --> 02:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
continue to engage uh in the stakeholder
 
02:30:04.349 --> 02:30:04.359 align:start position:0%
um working group process uh discussed as
 
02:30:07.590 --> 02:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
part of uh the final report on that
 
02:30:09.790 --> 02:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
investigation over the past several
 
02:30:13.590 --> 02:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
years um we have seen exponential growth
 
02:30:16.750 --> 02:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
in the number of solar applications that
 
02:30:18.950 --> 02:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
eversource has received although I think
 
02:30:20.349 --> 02:30:20.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's pretty consistent with the
 
02:30:22.910 --> 02:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
other utilities as well based upon our
 
02:30:25.309 --> 02:30:25.319 align:start position:0%
conversations with them uh to put it in
 
02:30:28.070 --> 02:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
perspective in the year 2000 we received
 
02:30:30.389 --> 02:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
about a thousand uh interconnection
 
02:30:35.670 --> 02:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
requests that went up to 1,500 in 200 uh
 
02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
21 uh in 2022
 
02:30:39.240 --> 02:30:40.990 align:start position:0%
21 uh in 2022
4,300

02:30:40.990 --> 02:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
4,300
 
02:30:42.670 --> 02:30:42.680 align:start position:0%
2023 uh
 
02:30:46.070 --> 02:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
4,700 and we're expecting this year uh
 
02:30:49.269 --> 02:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
over 5,000 interconnection applications
 
02:30:55.790 --> 02:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh that's a 3 37% increase um that surge
 
02:30:58.750 --> 02:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
uh which coincided uh with around the
 
02:31:02.790 --> 02:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
time of the pandemic um did result in in
 
02:31:04.710 --> 02:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
significant delays has resulted in
 
02:31:07.349 --> 02:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
significant delays and we have taken uh
 
02:31:09.670 --> 02:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
considerable steps to address those
 
02:31:13.710 --> 02:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
delays uh we responded by uh changing
 
02:31:17.830 --> 02:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
our process focusing first on uh smaller
 
02:31:20.910 --> 02:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
applications um the typical residential
 
02:31:20.920 --> 02:31:21.950 align:start position:0%
applications um the typical residential
solar

02:31:21.950 --> 02:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
solar
 
02:31:24.230 --> 02:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
interconnection uh We've implemented a
 
02:31:26.510 --> 02:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
FastTrack program for these smaller
 
02:31:28.349 --> 02:31:28.359 align:start position:0%
interconnections where there is a a
 
02:31:31.389 --> 02:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
quick review not a full engineering uh
 
02:31:34.429 --> 02:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
review we've separated them out from
 
02:31:36.750 --> 02:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
from the larger projects that are more
 
02:31:39.230 --> 02:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh complex and take more time uh in
 
02:31:42.750 --> 02:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
addition we have implemented uh new uh
 
02:31:45.750 --> 02:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
software Management program power clerk
 
02:31:47.990 --> 02:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh which allows an efficient review and
 
02:31:50.469 --> 02:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
automatic approval of some project
 
02:31:53.710 --> 02:31:53.720 align:start position:0%
and because of of those uh changes and
 
02:31:56.870 --> 02:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
process improvements today we are
 
02:31:59.429 --> 02:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
processing new applications I'm sorry
 
02:32:02.550 --> 02:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
95% of new applications for solar
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
interconnection within three days which
 
02:32:08.110 --> 02:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
I understand is significantly different
 
02:32:09.870 --> 02:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
from the testimony that you heard here
 
02:32:12.590 --> 02:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
today uh but the vast majority of
 
02:32:15.030 --> 02:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
eversource customers are receiving an
 
02:32:18.070 --> 02:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
initial turnaround within 3 days it is
 
02:32:20.670 --> 02:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
on average about 45
 
02:32:22.990 --> 02:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
um days after that for the installer to
 
02:32:25.309 --> 02:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
complete the installation and then the
 
02:32:29.870 --> 02:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
project is online within uh uh 46 to to
 
02:32:33.230 --> 02:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
48 days that's the average uh AC for
 
02:32:33.240 --> 02:32:35.070 align:start position:0%
48 days that's the average uh AC for
solar

02:32:35.070 --> 02:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
solar
 
02:32:38.349 --> 02:32:38.359 align:start position:0%
installations that said we understand
 
02:32:40.349 --> 02:32:40.359 align:start position:0%
that there is more work and considerable
 
02:32:42.510 --> 02:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
more work to be done to improve this
 
02:32:46.389 --> 02:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
process in particular uh larger projects
 
02:32:50.750 --> 02:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
over 100 KW uh the process to uh
 
02:32:54.230 --> 02:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
evaluate and address those programs uh
 
02:32:56.750 --> 02:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
we are in the process of continuing
 
02:32:59.790 --> 02:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
Improvement uh and I just want to pause
 
02:33:03.950 --> 02:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
here for a second um to be clear we do
 
02:33:07.550 --> 02:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
not oppose uh a Statewide rulem uh to
 
02:33:09.990 --> 02:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
set standards but we are not waiting for
 
02:33:12.429 --> 02:33:12.439 align:start position:0%
that rul making we're not waiting for uh
 
02:33:14.349 --> 02:33:14.359 align:start position:0%
the results of an investigation we are
 
02:33:17.469 --> 02:33:17.479 align:start position:0%
actively incorporating uh meeting with
 
02:33:19.150 --> 02:33:19.160 align:start position:0%
developers and incorporating their
 
02:33:22.429 --> 02:33:22.439 align:start position:0%
feedback on process improvements um to
 
02:33:24.910 --> 02:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are are turning things
 
02:33:27.110 --> 02:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
around as quickly as possible while
 
02:33:29.990 --> 02:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
still acting as a responsible utility
 
02:33:32.070 --> 02:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
protecting the safety and reliability of
 
02:33:35.950 --> 02:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
our system um larger projects which have
 
02:33:38.150 --> 02:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
mostly been the the focus of discussion
 
02:33:42.950 --> 02:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
today uh do require uh uh in some cases
 
02:33:46.630 --> 02:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
significant uh engineering review uh can
 
02:33:49.150 --> 02:33:49.160 align:start position:0%
have significant impacts on the Electric
 
02:33:52.510 --> 02:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
System and require project uh impact
 
02:33:56.630 --> 02:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
studies uh one of the um reforms that we
 
02:33:59.190 --> 02:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
put into place with our project in June
 
02:34:02.670 --> 02:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
of last year was an initial feasibility
 
02:34:06.230 --> 02:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
review process so this is a a high level
 
02:34:09.550 --> 02:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
look um at a a large solar uh
 
02:34:12.349 --> 02:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
interconnection application and initial
 
02:34:13.990 --> 02:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
feedback that we can provide to a
 
02:34:16.550 --> 02:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
developer that says this is going to be
 
02:34:19.150 --> 02:34:19.160 align:start position:0%
really expensive or this would not be
 
02:34:22.190 --> 02:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
really expensive ensive and they may be
 
02:34:24.510 --> 02:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
uh make the determination to proceed
 
02:34:27.309 --> 02:34:27.319 align:start position:0%
with with the project a lot of the
 
02:34:30.750 --> 02:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
projects that we have in our queue um
 
02:34:33.349 --> 02:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
are very Dynamic uh some of them are
 
02:34:35.870 --> 02:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
very mature projects some of them are
 
02:34:38.190 --> 02:34:38.200 align:start position:0%
candidly conceptual projects and the
 
02:34:40.630 --> 02:34:40.640 align:start position:0%
developer is sort of taking the utility
 
02:34:42.469 --> 02:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
temperature on whether there is a
 
02:34:44.469 --> 02:34:44.479 align:start position:0%
significant interconnection cost before
 
02:34:46.590 --> 02:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
deciding whether to proceed the
 
02:34:47.990 --> 02:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
implementation of that initial
 
02:34:50.830 --> 02:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
feasibility study tried to provide in a
 
02:34:54.590 --> 02:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
quick uh manner that that first blush
 
02:34:57.190 --> 02:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
first look of whether this is uh costly
 
02:34:57.200 --> 02:34:58.070 align:start position:0%
first look of whether this is uh costly
or

02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:35:01.510 --> 02:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
feasible in February of this year uh we
 
02:35:03.950 --> 02:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
actually posted on our website an update
 
02:35:06.429 --> 02:35:06.439 align:start position:0%
monthly a public interconnection queue
 
02:35:08.150 --> 02:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
for all the projects that we receive
 
02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:09.550 align:start position:0%
for all the projects that we receive
over

02:35:09.550 --> 02:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:35:12.550 --> 02:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
25kw uh this provides uh an insight to
 
02:35:15.429 --> 02:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
other developers uh the number of
 
02:35:17.469 --> 02:35:17.479 align:start position:0%
projects that we're reviewing as well as
 
02:35:20.110 --> 02:35:20.120 align:start position:0%
as timelines uh of when those were
 
02:35:21.990 --> 02:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
accepted so folks can get a sense of
 
02:35:24.830 --> 02:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
where they are um in the queue again
 
02:35:27.670 --> 02:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
this is updated uh on a monthly basis
 
02:35:30.429 --> 02:35:30.439 align:start position:0%
and is available publicly on our website
 
02:35:32.830 --> 02:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
we're currently uh as we did with the
 
02:35:36.870 --> 02:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
smaller uh projects um more residential
 
02:35:41.110 --> 02:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
in scale uh initiating a FastTrack uh
 
02:35:44.190 --> 02:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
review process for for projects between
 
02:35:47.510 --> 02:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
100 and 500 KW again one of the issues
 
02:35:49.190 --> 02:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
with these projects is they are
 
02:35:51.710 --> 02:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
currently lumped in with a queue of a
 
02:35:54.190 --> 02:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
megawatt 3 megawatts up to 5 megawatts
 
02:35:57.870 --> 02:35:57.880 align:start position:0%
for municipal projects those very large
 
02:36:01.389 --> 02:36:01.399 align:start position:0%
projects uh can require significant um
 
02:36:03.750 --> 02:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
interconnection study and in some cases
 
02:36:06.790 --> 02:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
can have uh impacts on on a substation
 
02:36:09.030 --> 02:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
which can be lengthy uh we think that
 
02:36:11.670 --> 02:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
this fast track for these these larger
 
02:36:14.990 --> 02:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
but midsize projects um will help to
 
02:36:17.389 --> 02:36:17.399 align:start position:0%
expedite their review and try to get
 
02:36:20.070 --> 02:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
them moving uh more quickly
 
02:36:23.550 --> 02:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
in addition uh we have added added staff
 
02:36:26.590 --> 02:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
we now have five uh staff members five
 
02:36:28.950 --> 02:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
employees that are uh in our engineering
 
02:36:32.790 --> 02:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
department uh doing these reviews um and
 
02:36:35.230 --> 02:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
trying to turn these projects around uh
 
02:36:38.190 --> 02:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible
 
02:36:41.150 --> 02:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
um we understand that there is more work
 
02:36:42.830 --> 02:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
to be done we understand that there are
 
02:36:44.670 --> 02:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
more improvements we can make to the
 
02:36:47.510 --> 02:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
process that said we have been uh
 
02:36:50.429 --> 02:36:50.439 align:start position:0%
diligently working to address the
 
02:36:52.309 --> 02:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
shortcomings in our process which
 
02:36:56.389 --> 02:36:56.399 align:start position:0%
candidly um was designed uh years ago
 
02:37:00.349 --> 02:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
for a much much smaller uh volume of
 
02:37:02.510 --> 02:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
projects as you heard from a previous
 
02:37:05.230 --> 02:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
eversource employee who was engaged in
 
02:37:08.110 --> 02:37:08.120 align:start position:0%
that process at that time we have made
 
02:37:11.710 --> 02:37:11.720 align:start position:0%
significant and um uh meaningful
 
02:37:14.950 --> 02:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
improvements to that process and uh just
 
02:37:18.630 --> 02:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
to be very clear um eversource's
 
02:37:20.510 --> 02:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
testimony my test testimony in the
 
02:37:23.030 --> 02:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
Senate on the bill as introduced uh we
 
02:37:25.750 --> 02:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
did Express concerns with the timeline
 
02:37:27.510 --> 02:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
in the bill is introduced which would
 
02:37:30.750 --> 02:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
have required puc adoption of a rule by
 
02:37:33.710 --> 02:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
December 31st of this year the bill did
 
02:37:36.110 --> 02:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
not have an effective date until 60 days
 
02:37:38.710 --> 02:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
after passage and then 45 days after
 
02:37:41.309 --> 02:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
that the commission was um required to
 
02:37:43.510 --> 02:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
open the proceeding which would have
 
02:37:45.630 --> 02:37:45.640 align:start position:0%
essentially started rulle making in
 
02:37:48.269 --> 02:37:48.279 align:start position:0%
November of of this year with an
 
02:37:50.990 --> 02:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
implementation of December
 
02:37:53.389 --> 02:37:53.399 align:start position:0%
31st just based on a simple reading of
 
02:37:55.670 --> 02:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
the jail car rules that was not feasible
 
02:37:58.550 --> 02:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
and we pointed that out um I am happy to
 
02:38:01.469 --> 02:38:01.479 align:start position:0%
answer whatever questions I
 
02:38:03.830 --> 02:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
may thank you Mr
 
02:38:06.190 --> 02:38:06.200 align:start position:0%
Lata everybody has a question we'll
 
02:38:09.550 --> 02:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
start with represent McGee thank you so
 
02:38:11.110 --> 02:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
my question would be a follow on to just
 
02:38:13.710 --> 02:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
where you left off which is that date
 
02:38:16.030 --> 02:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
was not workable in your estimation so
 
02:38:17.950 --> 02:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
what date would be would it would it be
 
02:38:20.110 --> 02:38:20.120 align:start position:0%
three months after that or you know how
 
02:38:21.469 --> 02:38:21.479 align:start position:0%
kind of a process do you think we can
 
02:38:23.710 --> 02:38:23.720 align:start position:0%
engage sure we think a 12-month uh
 
02:38:26.110 --> 02:38:26.120 align:start position:0%
process would be uh would be appropriate
 
02:38:27.269 --> 02:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
obviously I can't speak for the
 
02:38:29.469 --> 02:38:29.479 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and the Public
 
02:38:31.429 --> 02:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission who would both be
 
02:38:33.190 --> 02:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
actually administering the process and I
 
02:38:35.469 --> 02:38:35.479 align:start position:0%
know in the Senate they express concerns
 
02:38:37.389 --> 02:38:37.399 align:start position:0%
about at least the doe expressed
 
02:38:40.510 --> 02:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
concerns about um uh sort of bandwidth
 
02:38:43.190 --> 02:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
and Staffing in order to to do that
 
02:38:45.830 --> 02:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
again we are actively engaging with
 
02:38:47.990 --> 02:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
developers and making improvements to
 
02:38:50.030 --> 02:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
our process we are adopting many of the
 
02:38:52.469 --> 02:38:52.479 align:start position:0%
best practices um that have been
 
02:38:55.870 --> 02:38:55.880 align:start position:0%
identified in the IR process so I I
 
02:38:57.230 --> 02:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to leave the impression that
 
02:38:59.349 --> 02:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
we're sitting on our hands can I just
 
02:39:00.910 --> 02:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
follow I know other people have
 
02:39:02.389 --> 02:39:02.399 align:start position:0%
questions and I need to get out of here
 
02:39:04.950 --> 02:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
too and I also have a meter running out
 
02:39:08.870 --> 02:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
but um the follow on question would be
 
02:39:11.990 --> 02:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
um around the sort of the losses of the
 
02:39:13.590 --> 02:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
folks who are waiting in that queue
 
02:39:14.990 --> 02:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
right there's a there's an economic
 
02:39:16.830 --> 02:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
impact that's going on for folks that
 
02:39:18.750 --> 02:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
are waiting for us to do our jobs and
 
02:39:20.910 --> 02:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
for all of us to get our act together
 
02:39:22.750 --> 02:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
around rules that exist they're they're
 
02:39:25.230 --> 02:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
out there so pulling that together
 
02:39:29.150 --> 02:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
another year since we waited from the
 
02:39:34.030 --> 02:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
passage of 262 in 2022 until now uh and
 
02:39:35.710 --> 02:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
we still aren't really any further along
 
02:39:37.190 --> 02:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
in being able to Define rules that
 
02:39:40.429 --> 02:39:40.439 align:start position:0%
everybody can play by so um I I would
 
02:39:42.030 --> 02:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
just push back and say the year doesn't
 
02:39:43.910 --> 02:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
really seem tenable to me from a
 
02:39:46.389 --> 02:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
legislative perspective because we've
 
02:39:47.790 --> 02:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
kind of slow walked the people that are
 
02:39:50.950 --> 02:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
in the queue already so
 
02:39:54.429 --> 02:39:54.439 align:start position:0%
um do you think it's possible well the
 
02:39:56.550 --> 02:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
question is you said you think a year so
 
02:39:58.309 --> 02:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
you're asking for the your best case
 
02:40:00.790 --> 02:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
scenario on behalf of eversource but do
 
02:40:02.510 --> 02:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
you think that there that a shorter
 
02:40:05.790 --> 02:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
process than that uh can be achieved
 
02:40:08.510 --> 02:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think the answer to that is yes
 
02:40:10.590 --> 02:40:10.600 align:start position:0%
I I do think a faster process can be
 
02:40:14.030 --> 02:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
achieved and I think that um you know
 
02:40:16.030 --> 02:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's ad hoc working groups or or
 
02:40:18.309 --> 02:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
in World discussions among the parties
 
02:40:21.590 --> 02:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
are helpful and I think that's um uh
 
02:40:24.190 --> 02:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
certainly can help move things along
 
02:40:25.990 --> 02:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
when I say a year that's a deadline
 
02:40:29.190 --> 02:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
that's an end point that's not you know
 
02:40:32.309 --> 02:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
when it has to be done uh hope ideally
 
02:40:35.269 --> 02:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
it would be done faster than that
 
02:40:37.429 --> 02:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a
 
02:40:40.710 --> 02:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
question but he changed his mind so
 
02:40:43.070 --> 02:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
representative muns will take over thank
 
02:40:46.190 --> 02:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
you um you talked you you described some
 
02:40:48.670 --> 02:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
of the additional resources that you've
 
02:40:51.870 --> 02:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
um employed to move things along
 
02:40:55.469 --> 02:40:55.479 align:start position:0%
software Etc uh what I didn't hear is um
 
02:40:58.030 --> 02:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
Human Resources I mean you know have you
 
02:41:01.230 --> 02:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
have you staffed up um yes I apologize
 
02:41:02.670 --> 02:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
if that wasn't clear in my testimony we
 
02:41:04.750 --> 02:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
have staffed up we now have five
 
02:41:06.670 --> 02:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
employees uh in our engineering
 
02:41:08.469 --> 02:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
department doing the the uh
 
02:41:08.479 --> 02:41:09.870 align:start position:0%
department doing the the uh
interconnection

02:41:09.870 --> 02:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
interconnection
 
02:41:09.880 --> 02:41:11.710 align:start position:0%
interconnection
reviews

02:41:11.710 --> 02:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
reviews
 
02:41:14.070 --> 02:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
followup and do you do all of the uh
 
02:41:16.030 --> 02:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
interconnection studies inous or do you
 
02:41:18.670 --> 02:41:18.680 align:start position:0%
utilize Outsource outside third parties
 
02:41:21.830 --> 02:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
as well we we utilize uh third parties
 
02:41:24.510 --> 02:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
as well based upon the complexity and
 
02:41:27.710 --> 02:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:30.550 --> 02:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
project okay seeing no more questions we
 
02:41:32.630 --> 02:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
want to thank you Mr Lata and we're
 
02:41:34.309 --> 02:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
going to give the last word of the day
 
02:41:37.830 --> 02:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
to Josh Elliot from the Department of
 
02:41:40.150 --> 02:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
energy I'm sure he'll have some
 
02:41:42.269 --> 02:41:42.279 align:start position:0%
interesting things to say about this
 
02:41:42.279 --> 02:41:46.830 align:start position:0%
interesting things to say about this
whole

02:41:46.830 --> 02:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:49.230 --> 02:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
process good afternoon Mr chairman
 
02:41:50.550 --> 02:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee again for the
 
02:41:51.910 --> 02:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
record Josh Elliot director of the
 
02:41:54.070 --> 02:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
division of policy and programs um the
 
02:41:56.550 --> 02:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
department is neutral on this bill um I
 
02:41:58.750 --> 02:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
think the problem has been laid out
 
02:42:01.070 --> 02:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
thoroughly by the uh previous speakers
 
02:42:03.150 --> 02:42:03.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of what exactly the issue is
 
02:42:05.150 --> 02:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to tackle
 
02:42:08.710 --> 02:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
here um I will stress this um the
 
02:42:10.389 --> 02:42:10.399 align:start position:0%
department is being asked to do this Ru
 
02:42:11.750 --> 02:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
making process I know there were
 
02:42:13.750 --> 02:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
questions about the Pu versus the the
 
02:42:16.110 --> 02:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
doe doing it um the 900 rules will
 
02:42:18.670 --> 02:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
eventually become the energy or 900
 
02:42:20.150 --> 02:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
rules so Mak sense if we're going to be
 
02:42:21.710 --> 02:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
doing going to be administering these
 
02:42:22.990 --> 02:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
rules that we should go that the
 
02:42:24.150 --> 02:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
department should be the one rather than
 
02:42:25.950 --> 02:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
the puc doing this
 
02:42:28.230 --> 02:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
process at a fundamental level and as
 
02:42:30.110 --> 02:42:30.120 align:start position:0%
you've heard today this is a
 
02:42:33.150 --> 02:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
disagreement um between the utilities
 
02:42:34.950 --> 02:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
and solar developers that the department
 
02:42:37.349 --> 02:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
is being asked to adjudicate here um in
 
02:42:38.870 --> 02:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
developing these these
 
02:42:40.910 --> 02:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
rules talking a little bit more about
 
02:42:44.110 --> 02:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
the the rule process um Mr Lata sort of
 
02:42:46.070 --> 02:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh outlined the issues that the
 
02:42:48.550 --> 02:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
department had with uh the bill as
 
02:42:50.870 --> 02:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
introduced we um had those concerns
 
02:42:52.510 --> 02:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
because it would literally require us to
 
02:42:54.510 --> 02:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
violate Jael car statutes so in order to
 
02:42:56.269 --> 02:42:56.279 align:start position:0%
implement that bill as introduced we
 
02:42:57.870 --> 02:42:57.880 align:start position:0%
would have been violating other areas of
 
02:43:03.309 --> 02:43:03.319 align:start position:0%
State Statute um the rule process um the
 
02:43:04.750 --> 02:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
uh and I would certainly encourage you
 
02:43:06.590 --> 02:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
folks if you have not served on Jael car
 
02:43:07.950 --> 02:43:07.960 align:start position:0%
to certainly talk to your colleagues who
 
02:43:09.510 --> 02:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
have been on jail car or currently serve
 
02:43:11.750 --> 02:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
on Jael car the idea with going through
 
02:43:13.510 --> 02:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
a rulle making process and why these are
 
02:43:16.150 --> 02:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
Draft rules is because you want to sort
 
02:43:18.030 --> 02:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
out all of the areas of disagreement
 
02:43:20.510 --> 02:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
ahead of time you want to present Jael
 
02:43:22.710 --> 02:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
car with a clean set of rules that all
 
02:43:24.750 --> 02:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders have had their input on
 
02:43:27.269 --> 02:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
that everyone can maybe not agree with
 
02:43:29.750 --> 02:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
but can live with if you have a
 
02:43:32.230 --> 02:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
contentious Ru making process that can
 
02:43:33.590 --> 02:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
get dragged out indefinitely and that
 
02:43:35.429 --> 02:43:35.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't serve anyone's best interest so
 
02:43:37.630 --> 02:43:37.640 align:start position:0%
the idea here of getting Draft rules
 
02:43:39.230 --> 02:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
that can be submitted to Jael car that's
 
02:43:42.269 --> 02:43:42.279 align:start position:0%
that are clean that everyone is in I say
 
02:43:44.630 --> 02:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
agree maybe maybe a b too strong of a
 
02:43:46.469 --> 02:43:46.479 align:start position:0%
word but everyone can live with is sort
 
02:43:48.830 --> 02:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
of the ideal situation I know they're
 
02:43:50.349 --> 02:43:50.359 align:start position:0%
bring questions on timelines and
 
02:43:53.429 --> 02:43:53.439 align:start position:0%
requests for a firm timeline I get it I
 
02:43:55.630 --> 02:43:55.640 align:start position:0%
understand it but really it is comes
 
02:43:57.269 --> 02:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
down to how quickly can all the folks
 
02:44:00.030 --> 02:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
who stalked here today work with the
 
02:44:01.830 --> 02:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
including the utilities work together to
 
02:44:04.030 --> 02:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
find areas where there are common sense
 
02:44:05.830 --> 02:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
areas of agreement and where there are
 
02:44:07.190 --> 02:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
areas of disagreement that need to
 
02:44:08.670 --> 02:44:08.680 align:start position:0%
further work on and to start having
 
02:44:10.910 --> 02:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
those hard conversations about where
 
02:44:12.309 --> 02:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
those disagreements are and what they
 
02:44:13.990 --> 02:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
can live with and what they can't live
 
02:44:16.830 --> 02:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
with and what's a red line for them that
 
02:44:18.670 --> 02:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
would make this process go all the much
 
02:44:20.389 --> 02:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
faster if there are areas that we can
 
02:44:21.990 --> 02:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
knock out and say yep we're all set with
 
02:44:23.070 --> 02:44:23.080 align:start position:0%
that we're all set with that we're all
 
02:44:25.269 --> 02:44:25.279 align:start position:0%
set with that the ru making process goes
 
02:44:27.990 --> 02:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
that much faster I will just add um as
 
02:44:30.030 --> 02:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
has been referenced previously There are
 
02:44:32.910 --> 02:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
rules um in the 900 rules that deal with
 
02:44:35.070 --> 02:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
small interconnection so below 100
 
02:44:38.030 --> 02:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
kilowatts um in size above 100 kilowatts
 
02:44:40.429 --> 02:44:40.439 align:start position:0%
it defers to the Tariff which are um
 
02:44:41.790 --> 02:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
issued by each of the respective
 
02:44:44.429 --> 02:44:44.439 align:start position:0%
utilities so for the small um customer
 
02:44:45.630 --> 02:44:45.640 align:start position:0%
for example for the gentleman from
 
02:44:47.510 --> 02:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
Londoner I did give him my business card
 
02:44:49.030 --> 02:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
we can have our consumer services folks
 
02:44:51.190 --> 02:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
FKS um get in touch with him to figure
 
02:44:53.190 --> 02:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
out his particular issue but as you've
 
02:44:56.070 --> 02:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
heard today most of these issues stem
 
02:44:59.830 --> 02:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
from uh larger um uh arrays attempting
 
02:45:02.710 --> 02:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
to interconnect to the grid so with that
 
02:45:04.550 --> 02:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
mindful it is the afternoon already I
 
02:45:05.910 --> 02:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
will I be happy to take questions from
 
02:45:08.710 --> 02:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
the committee okay thank you
 
02:45:10.590 --> 02:45:10.600 align:start position:0%
representative Corman does have a
 
02:45:12.710 --> 02:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:45:16.429 --> 02:45:16.439 align:start position:0%
Mr Al for taking my question uh so uh
 
02:45:18.429 --> 02:45:18.439 align:start position:0%
the first thing I want to ask is uh was
 
02:45:20.830 --> 02:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
it the O's request that the timeline was
 
02:45:24.190 --> 02:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
removed from the original bill but I
 
02:45:26.950 --> 02:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
want to also uh
 
02:45:29.510 --> 02:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
ask I mean I I understand what you're
 
02:45:32.590 --> 02:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
saying that that the timeline depends on
 
02:45:34.950 --> 02:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
how quickly stakeholders can actually
 
02:45:37.510 --> 02:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
agree on things but it seems like there
 
02:45:40.150 --> 02:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
are going to be some issues where it's
 
02:45:42.030 --> 02:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
just going to be very difficult to get
 
02:45:44.429 --> 02:45:44.439 align:start position:0%
everybody to
 
02:45:47.750 --> 02:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
agree who is the appropriate referee
 
02:45:50.750 --> 02:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
then to actually figure out the actual
 
02:45:53.550 --> 02:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
rule that is a good question absent any
 
02:45:54.750 --> 02:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
any of the existing rules you sort of
 
02:45:56.429 --> 02:45:56.439 align:start position:0%
run into a chicken in the egg sorry my
 
02:45:58.150 --> 02:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
apologies um thank you for the question
 
02:46:00.150 --> 02:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
to answer your first question yes the
 
02:46:03.110 --> 02:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
doe did request that timeline be removed
 
02:46:04.389 --> 02:46:04.399 align:start position:0%
because it literally would have VI
 
02:46:05.990 --> 02:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
required us to violate other areas of
 
02:46:09.710 --> 02:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
State Statute um regarding your your
 
02:46:11.790 --> 02:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
question right there are areas where
 
02:46:13.070 --> 02:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
everyone is going to have to come into
 
02:46:15.269 --> 02:46:15.279 align:start position:0%
an agreement the there's a bit of a
 
02:46:16.910 --> 02:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
chicken and egg right there's no Hammer
 
02:46:18.510 --> 02:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
here that we can force everybody into an
 
02:46:20.710 --> 02:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
agreement on something because if we we
 
02:46:22.230 --> 02:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
were to force everybody into an
 
02:46:23.910 --> 02:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
agreement on something with these Draft
 
02:46:26.269 --> 02:46:26.279 align:start position:0%
rules then it goes to Jael car nobody's
 
02:46:28.910 --> 02:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
Bound by whatever that by our Hammer
 
02:46:30.670 --> 02:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
they can then litigate it at jail car
 
02:46:32.429 --> 02:46:32.439 align:start position:0%
and go through that entire process and
 
02:46:34.389 --> 02:46:34.399 align:start position:0%
relitigate issues that we have decided
 
02:46:36.670 --> 02:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
forcefully that hey this is this is the
 
02:46:37.830 --> 02:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
side we're picking this is what we're
 
02:46:41.870 --> 02:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:44.190 --> 02:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
rules representative Kaplan has a
 
02:46:46.309 --> 02:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair this is a
 
02:46:47.830 --> 02:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
similar question to representative
 
02:46:50.590 --> 02:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
Corman about the process uh can you give
 
02:46:52.630 --> 02:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
us an idea of what what the working
 
02:46:54.349 --> 02:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
groups would look like that would uh
 
02:46:56.070 --> 02:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
that you would draw on to to make these
 
02:46:59.230 --> 02:46:59.240 align:start position:0%
rules and and how public a process is it
 
02:47:01.269 --> 02:47:01.279 align:start position:0%
sure um we would certainly as like any
 
02:47:02.790 --> 02:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
other state agency we would make this a
 
02:47:04.870 --> 02:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
public process so any of the particular
 
02:47:07.349 --> 02:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
parties who wished to attend or offer
 
02:47:09.990 --> 02:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
input would be invited to attend um
 
02:47:11.389 --> 02:47:11.399 align:start position:0%
obviously I know there's certain time
 
02:47:12.870 --> 02:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
challenges with everybody about being
 
02:47:14.830 --> 02:47:14.840 align:start position:0%
able to be able either offer quick input
 
02:47:16.309 --> 02:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
so there probably be certain public
 
02:47:17.910 --> 02:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
comments versus somebody who's part of a
 
02:47:20.150 --> 02:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
working group who has that um time or
 
02:47:21.830 --> 02:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
bandwidth commitment um but there
 
02:47:23.269 --> 02:47:23.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't certainly be any limit in
 
02:47:28.510 --> 02:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:31.910 --> 02:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
can't representative Ms thank you Mr
 
02:47:34.030 --> 02:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you Mr Elliott taking my
 
02:47:37.590 --> 02:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
my question uh you've acknowledged that
 
02:47:41.030 --> 02:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
um this is a this is an issue and that
 
02:47:43.630 --> 02:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
also it's um it's complex and it's going
 
02:47:45.309 --> 02:47:45.319 align:start position:0%
to it's going to be the resolution of is
 
02:47:50.309 --> 02:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
going to be very timec consuming um
 
02:47:52.429 --> 02:47:52.439 align:start position:0%
why do we need this statute I mean why
 
02:47:54.590 --> 02:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
why do we need this bill why can't the
 
02:47:56.790 --> 02:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
the department initiate a rulemaking
 
02:47:58.469 --> 02:47:58.479 align:start position:0%
process right
 
02:48:01.190 --> 02:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
now so uh thank you for the question so
 
02:48:03.190 --> 02:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
gel car as part of their Process reviews
 
02:48:04.830 --> 02:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
whether there's statutory authority to
 
02:48:06.550 --> 02:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
create rules rules have the full force
 
02:48:08.870 --> 02:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
and effect of law um I don't think it
 
02:48:10.389 --> 02:48:10.399 align:start position:0%
would be good policy to have state
 
02:48:12.070 --> 02:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
agencies just making rules on whatever
 
02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:14.750 align:start position:0%
agencies just making rules on whatever
they

02:48:14.750 --> 02:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:20.429 --> 02:48:20.439 align:start position:0%
wish okay who else representative reels
 
02:48:23.070 --> 02:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
succinct question I promise
 
02:48:25.349 --> 02:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh my question has to do with your
 
02:48:29.030 --> 02:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
assessment and your testimony that
 
02:48:31.870 --> 02:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
um rules would have to be drafted from
 
02:48:33.950 --> 02:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
scratch do you
 
02:48:39.389 --> 02:48:39.399 align:start position:0%
not feel that the recently issued IR
 
02:48:43.309 --> 02:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
model interconnection procedures and the
 
02:48:45.349 --> 02:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
existing Massachusetts
 
02:48:48.830 --> 02:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
interconnection rules where our states
 
02:48:52.910 --> 02:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
utility eversource is also
 
02:48:56.389 --> 02:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
operates constitute a substantial basis
 
02:48:58.150 --> 02:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
for a rulemaking that you wouldn't have
 
02:49:00.429 --> 02:49:00.439 align:start position:0%
to we wouldn't be starting from scratch
 
02:49:01.870 --> 02:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
U thank you for the question yeah and
 
02:49:03.870 --> 02:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to clarify um
 
02:49:06.870 --> 02:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
in my in my comment in the uh testimony
 
02:49:08.830 --> 02:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
letter uh was referenced to that there
 
02:49:11.309 --> 02:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
are no existing interconnection rules
 
02:49:13.269 --> 02:49:13.279 align:start position:0%
for larger generators so in that sense
 
02:49:14.670 --> 02:49:14.680 align:start position:0%
we would be starting for Scratch are
 
02:49:18.229 --> 02:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
there uh in terms of specific rule sets
 
02:49:20.590 --> 02:49:20.600 align:start position:0%
for interconnections for larger
 
02:49:23.790 --> 02:49:23.800 align:start position:0%
generators within the p900 rules so it's
 
02:49:25.190 --> 02:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
not as though we are starting from
 
02:49:26.309 --> 02:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
something and need to make a couple of
 
02:49:28.750 --> 02:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
tweaks it is a sort of a full drafting
 
02:49:30.510 --> 02:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
to your point yes there are different
 
02:49:32.190 --> 02:49:32.200 align:start position:0%
models that are out there as part of the
 
02:49:33.550 --> 02:49:33.560 align:start position:0%
the process that had been referenced to
 
02:49:35.670 --> 02:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
earlier um there were six different um
 
02:49:39.590 --> 02:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
potential interconnection um models um
 
02:49:41.429 --> 02:49:41.439 align:start position:0%
that um had been offered as potential
 
02:49:45.229 --> 02:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
starting points um those um are are
 
02:49:46.590 --> 02:49:46.600 align:start position:0%
starting points right New Hampshire has
 
02:49:48.070 --> 02:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
a slightly different regulatory scheme
 
02:49:50.030 --> 02:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
than massachus Connecticut does sort of
 
02:49:52.030 --> 02:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
importing something wholesale from
 
02:49:53.550 --> 02:49:53.560 align:start position:0%
another state could lead to further
 
02:49:55.030 --> 02:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
complications I think was referenced
 
02:49:56.870 --> 02:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
earlier the what exists now for ever
 
02:49:58.150 --> 02:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
Source was sort of cribed from
 
02:50:00.670 --> 02:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
Connecticut um and has sort of outlived
 
02:50:02.910 --> 02:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
its usefulness so just taking it Taking
 
02:50:05.469 --> 02:50:05.479 align:start position:0%
an entire set straight from uh one of
 
02:50:09.030 --> 02:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
these models um is is a starting point I
 
02:50:11.389 --> 02:50:11.399 align:start position:0%
yes I agree to that uh or agree to that
 
02:50:13.349 --> 02:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
um that sentiment but it will still
 
02:50:15.269 --> 02:50:15.279 align:start position:0%
require refinement and aligning with New
 
02:50:15.279 --> 02:50:17.110 align:start position:0%
require refinement and aligning with New
Hampshire

02:50:17.110 --> 02:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:50:19.750 --> 02:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
statutes thank you okay seeing no
 
02:50:21.750 --> 02:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
further questions and having spent
 
02:50:24.190 --> 02:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
almost two hours on this public hearing
 
02:50:26.710 --> 02:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank you for wrapping it up
 
02:50:29.550 --> 02:50:29.560 align:start position:0%
for us and for being here this afternoon
 
02:50:31.550 --> 02:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
and now I'm going to close the public
 
02:50:34.469 --> 02:50:34.479 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
02:50:37.229 --> 02:50:37.239 align:start position:0%
391 the committee will now take a lunch
 
02:50:39.750 --> 02:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
break and return at
 
02:50:42.309 --> 02:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
1:15 for a presentation by the
 
02:50:45.349 --> 02:50:45.359 align:start position:0%

03:48:22.990 --> 03:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
we'll do our best to be prompt provide
 
03:48:24.510 --> 03:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
information and answer questions of
 
03:48:26.670 --> 03:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
course seeing that Ted is here we
 
03:48:28.830 --> 03:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
decided to put the Gulf of main offshore
 
03:48:30.590 --> 03:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
wind initiative up first and with that
 
03:48:32.269 --> 03:48:32.279 align:start position:0%
I'll just quickly turn it over to Ted
 
03:48:34.590 --> 03:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
for his couple
 
03:48:36.630 --> 03:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
slides well thank you very much it's
 
03:48:39.349 --> 03:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
great to be here uh and I appreciate the
 
03:48:41.070 --> 03:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to kind of talk a little bit
 
03:48:43.070 --> 03:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
about getting you up to speed for those
 
03:48:45.790 --> 03:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
of you who are not up to speed on uh
 
03:48:48.469 --> 03:48:48.479 align:start position:0%
where offshore wind is headed in the
 
03:48:51.550 --> 03:48:51.560 align:start position:0%
Gulf of Maine so I'm going to just uh I
 
03:48:53.269 --> 03:48:53.279 align:start position:0%
really just have a couple of slides that
 
03:48:54.910 --> 03:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
kind of talk about time frames but I'm
 
03:48:57.309 --> 03:48:57.319 align:start position:0%
going to Veer off from that and give you
 
03:49:00.030 --> 03:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
a whole number of updates in terms of
 
03:49:03.269 --> 03:49:03.279 align:start position:0%
what is going on both uh regionally and
 
03:49:05.790 --> 03:49:05.800 align:start position:0%
as a state uh the various different
 
03:49:08.030 --> 03:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
agencies we are but one of several
 
03:49:11.229 --> 03:49:11.239 align:start position:0%
agencies which are involved in this work
 
03:49:13.710 --> 03:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
and we have a very active uh
 
03:49:15.950 --> 03:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
collaboration with our sister State
 
03:49:17.790 --> 03:49:17.800 align:start position:0%
agencies and I'll talk more about that
 
03:49:20.309 --> 03:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
as well but let's just jump into kind of
 
03:49:22.910 --> 03:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
the time frame and the process that's
 
03:49:25.510 --> 03:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
going on right
 
03:49:29.349 --> 03:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
now so I like to say that where we are
 
03:49:32.269 --> 03:49:32.279 align:start position:0%
in the uh Gulf of main offshore W wind
 
03:49:34.950 --> 03:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
leasing process is that we are at the
 
03:49:36.070 --> 03:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
end of the
 
03:49:39.990 --> 03:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
beginning so um the way that this works
 
03:49:43.030 --> 03:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
is several years ago sen uh Governor
 
03:49:45.149 --> 03:49:45.159 align:start position:0%
sonunu as well as some other Governors
 
03:49:47.990 --> 03:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
requested a task force for the Gulf of
 
03:49:50.510 --> 03:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
Maine to look at offshore wind that
 
03:49:53.070 --> 03:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
stimulated bom the Bureau of ocean
 
03:49:54.870 --> 03:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
Energy Management which is the federal
 
03:49:57.830 --> 03:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
agency which leases out pieces of the
 
03:50:02.870 --> 03:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
ocean uh for for energy stuff and so
 
03:50:05.149 --> 03:50:05.159 align:start position:0%
they convene this task force the task
 
03:50:07.110 --> 03:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
force includes lots of people many of
 
03:50:09.070 --> 03:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
your constituents from communities
 
03:50:09.080 --> 03:50:10.070 align:start position:0%
your constituents from communities
elected

03:50:10.070 --> 03:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
elected
 
03:50:12.790 --> 03:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
officials and at that point that sort of
 
03:50:15.550 --> 03:50:15.560 align:start position:0%
kicked off this process of beginning to
 
03:50:18.309 --> 03:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
understand where leases might
 
03:50:21.830 --> 03:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
go where we started on this process was
 
03:50:23.429 --> 03:50:23.439 align:start position:0%
with pretty much the entirety of the
 
03:50:26.670 --> 03:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
Gulf of Maine and where we are today is
 
03:50:29.590 --> 03:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
that they just last Friday released the
 
03:50:31.950 --> 03:50:31.960 align:start position:0%
actual wind energy areas which
 
03:50:35.750 --> 03:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
incorporate um some millions of Acres of
 
03:50:40.110 --> 03:50:40.120 align:start position:0%
ocean largely uh sort of the South I
 
03:50:43.030 --> 03:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
would say South Central to South um
 
03:50:45.469 --> 03:50:45.479 align:start position:0%
eastern part of the Gulf of Maine so if
 
03:50:47.870 --> 03:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
you sort of picture uh coming off of
 
03:50:51.790 --> 03:50:51.800 align:start position:0%
Cape Cod about 30 mil off of Cape Cod
 
03:50:54.790 --> 03:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
and extending up about 50 miles from
 
03:50:57.630 --> 03:50:57.640 align:start position:0%
there uh out in the ocean uh at its
 
03:51:00.030 --> 03:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
closest point to New Hampshire that wind
 
03:51:03.429 --> 03:51:03.439 align:start position:0%
energy area is about uh about 30 mil or
 
03:51:06.269 --> 03:51:06.279 align:start position:0%
so offshore and at its most distant
 
03:51:09.429 --> 03:51:09.439 align:start position:0%
place it's about 92 miles for those of
 
03:51:12.670 --> 03:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
you who are are Tech Geeks which I don't
 
03:51:13.950 --> 03:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
know at this committee seems like you
 
03:51:16.870 --> 03:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
might want to have a couple um what that
 
03:51:19.070 --> 03:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
means essentially for the Gulf of Maine
 
03:51:20.630 --> 03:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
is that we're not going to be able to
 
03:51:22.790 --> 03:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
have AC cable it's going to be it's
 
03:51:25.790 --> 03:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
going to be DC cable so if you think
 
03:51:27.990 --> 03:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
about that you know just from a DC we
 
03:51:30.030 --> 03:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
can geek out here for just one second on
 
03:51:33.429 --> 03:51:33.439 align:start position:0%
DC is that what that means is that
 
03:51:35.429 --> 03:51:35.439 align:start position:0%
that's that's DC cable that has to be
 
03:51:38.830 --> 03:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
created which is not readily available
 
03:51:41.469 --> 03:51:41.479 align:start position:0%
there's basically one uh Factory in the
 
03:51:44.110 --> 03:51:44.120 align:start position:0%
United States that makes DC and if you
 
03:51:46.790 --> 03:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
looked at all the needs for DC cable
 
03:51:49.149 --> 03:51:49.159 align:start position:0%
around the entire offshore uh what's
 
03:51:51.189 --> 03:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
being sort of planned out in the world
 
03:51:54.189 --> 03:51:54.199 align:start position:0%
right now um it would take something
 
03:51:56.349 --> 03:51:56.359 align:start position:0%
like uh
 
03:52:00.189 --> 03:52:00.199 align:start position:0%
990,000 uh person hours uh in order to
 
03:52:02.469 --> 03:52:02.479 align:start position:0%
build the amount of DC cable that would
 
03:52:05.309 --> 03:52:05.319 align:start position:0%
be required so I think that that just
 
03:52:06.870 --> 03:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
sort of puts this in perspective that
 
03:52:08.910 --> 03:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
there are some still some technological
 
03:52:12.309 --> 03:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
issues um and the depth of the Gulf of
 
03:52:13.950 --> 03:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
Maine would require all of these
 
03:52:15.870 --> 03:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
facilities to be
 
03:52:18.469 --> 03:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
floating uh again technology which is
 
03:52:20.830 --> 03:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
now being employed throughout the world
 
03:52:24.110 --> 03:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
there are several new uh offshore wind
 
03:52:27.469 --> 03:52:27.479 align:start position:0%
uh floating technology uh basically
 
03:52:29.870 --> 03:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
structures arrays uh and the first
 
03:52:32.349 --> 03:52:32.359 align:start position:0%
commercial ones are just coming online
 
03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh Portugal I believe is one and then
 
03:52:37.309 --> 03:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
there's looking at southeast Asia is
 
03:52:38.510 --> 03:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
going to be the other place where these
 
03:52:41.550 --> 03:52:41.560 align:start position:0%
are going to be more common so that's
 
03:52:43.389 --> 03:52:43.399 align:start position:0%
kind of the the sort of State of Affairs
 
03:52:45.349 --> 03:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
as to where this is headed so the idea
 
03:52:47.389 --> 03:52:47.399 align:start position:0%
with the bom leasing process is that
 
03:52:50.309 --> 03:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
it'll establish this very long process
 
03:52:52.309 --> 03:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
which includes lots and lots of public
 
03:52:54.830 --> 03:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
input opportunities to go from the
 
03:52:57.269 --> 03:52:57.279 align:start position:0%
entire Gulf of Maine down to a subset of
 
03:52:59.710 --> 03:52:59.720 align:start position:0%
the Gulf of Maine uh which is what
 
03:53:01.510 --> 03:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
released on Friday and I will send that
 
03:53:03.550 --> 03:53:03.560 align:start position:0%
along to you after this so you can look
 
03:53:05.429 --> 03:53:05.439 align:start position:0%
at those maps in detail on your own
 
03:53:07.389 --> 03:53:07.399 align:start position:0%
computer because it's kind of fun to
 
03:53:10.070 --> 03:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
explore that yeah go ahead jump in yeah
 
03:53:12.429 --> 03:53:12.439 align:start position:0%
thanks I just want to be clear the um
 
03:53:14.830 --> 03:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
the decision released on Friday was just
 
03:53:16.349 --> 03:53:16.359 align:start position:0%
what areas are going to be leased the
 
03:53:18.229 --> 03:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
leases themselves were not actually
 
03:53:20.070 --> 03:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
assigned right so this is an area in
 
03:53:22.269 --> 03:53:22.279 align:start position:0%
which there were there could be leases
 
03:53:25.070 --> 03:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
within these areas so it's narrowed down
 
03:53:27.149 --> 03:53:27.159 align:start position:0%
to just these wind energy areas where
 
03:53:28.429 --> 03:53:28.439 align:start position:0%
there could be
 
03:53:32.309 --> 03:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
leases what comes up next after this
 
03:53:34.389 --> 03:53:34.399 align:start position:0%
will'll actually be establishing where
 
03:53:36.429 --> 03:53:36.439 align:start position:0%
those lease areas are going to be and
 
03:53:38.790 --> 03:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
what's actually going to be released for
 
03:53:41.710 --> 03:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
lease how many leases they atttend to to
 
03:53:44.229 --> 03:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
create how big each of those leases will
 
03:53:44.239 --> 03:53:44.990 align:start position:0%
create how big each of those leases will
be

03:53:44.990 --> 03:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:53:48.790 --> 03:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
and all of the other you know autal that
 
03:53:50.950 --> 03:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
goes along with the leasing process
 
03:53:52.550 --> 03:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
which I'll talk a little bit more about
 
03:53:56.990 --> 03:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
Henry yeah thank you uh with regards to
 
03:54:00.110 --> 03:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
the leases how is how is the cable the
 
03:54:03.189 --> 03:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
the length of the cable handle uh is it
 
03:54:05.510 --> 03:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
is it treated as lease property or a
 
03:54:09.510 --> 03:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
lease to to to to do or is yes that's
 
03:54:11.750 --> 03:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
going to be delineated on the ground it
 
03:54:14.070 --> 03:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
will not be this is a really good
 
03:54:16.070 --> 03:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
question in one of the vexing this is
 
03:54:18.229 --> 03:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
one of the most vexing pieces of the
 
03:54:20.349 --> 03:54:20.359 align:start position:0%
process um and let me let me come back
 
03:54:21.670 --> 03:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
to that question in a second let me sort
 
03:54:23.070 --> 03:54:23.080 align:start position:0%
of kind talk about where we are where
 
03:54:24.910 --> 03:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
we're headed if you have I think in
 
03:54:26.429 --> 03:54:26.439 align:start position:0%
front of you you have a piece of paper
 
03:54:29.149 --> 03:54:29.159 align:start position:0%
that looks something like this it says
 
03:54:30.750 --> 03:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
oh it should be up on oh sorry I didn't
 
03:54:34.030 --> 03:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
even see it there this slide
 
03:54:37.349 --> 03:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
here that you see you see the star there
 
03:54:39.030 --> 03:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
which shows that the wind energy areas
 
03:54:41.189 --> 03:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
have been are now established those are
 
03:54:43.910 --> 03:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
the final wind energy areas where we'll
 
03:54:46.030 --> 03:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
be headed within the next 30 days or so
 
03:54:47.830 --> 03:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
is that they will have a proposed lease
 
03:54:51.110 --> 03:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
notice that proposed lease notice then
 
03:54:53.469 --> 03:54:53.479 align:start position:0%
begins to get those actual lease areas
 
03:54:55.990 --> 03:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
and it puts the language of the leases
 
03:54:58.189 --> 03:54:58.199 align:start position:0%
out so there's a couple of things that
 
03:54:59.910 --> 03:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
will happen with this within the lease
 
03:55:02.189 --> 03:55:02.199 align:start position:0%
there'll be lease Provisions require
 
03:55:04.469 --> 03:55:04.479 align:start position:0%
people to do certain things within those
 
03:55:07.510 --> 03:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
leases as well as there will also be
 
03:55:10.429 --> 03:55:10.439 align:start position:0%
bidding credits so bidding credits um
 
03:55:14.469 --> 03:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
are are established to do um basically
 
03:55:16.189 --> 03:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
it identifies particular things that
 
03:55:18.030 --> 03:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to do if you want
 
03:55:20.910 --> 03:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
to go go in on this bid so there's two
 
03:55:22.269 --> 03:55:22.279 align:start position:0%
different aspects of this and we're
 
03:55:23.870 --> 03:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
doing we're going to be doing an an
 
03:55:26.429 --> 03:55:26.439 align:start position:0%
Outreach session for stakeholders in New
 
03:55:29.269 --> 03:55:29.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on this process in about a
 
03:55:31.550 --> 03:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
month and a half so that anyone who's
 
03:55:33.469 --> 03:55:33.479 align:start position:0%
interested in understanding the ins and
 
03:55:37.590 --> 03:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
outs of that will be able to have uh uh
 
03:55:38.950 --> 03:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
we we'll have a session and I'll make
 
03:55:41.349 --> 03:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
sure that you all are notified about
 
03:55:42.670 --> 03:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
that because that's where this starts to
 
03:55:45.710 --> 03:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
get really interesting um some of those
 
03:55:48.349 --> 03:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
Provisions could be things like how are
 
03:55:50.550 --> 03:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
you going to make sure that Fisheries
 
03:55:53.510 --> 03:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
monitoring continues to take place uh
 
03:55:55.790 --> 03:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
within your lease how are you going to
 
03:55:57.469 --> 03:55:57.479 align:start position:0%
deal with safety issues how are you
 
03:55:59.990 --> 03:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
going to deal with other issues and and
 
03:56:02.590 --> 03:56:02.600 align:start position:0%
eventually we'll get around to trans
 
03:56:05.309 --> 03:56:05.319 align:start position:0%
transmission but the idea within that is
 
03:56:06.830 --> 03:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
that there'll be a number of Provisions
 
03:56:09.710 --> 03:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
about what you can and can't do and and
 
03:56:11.950 --> 03:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
money that you're going to have to pay
 
03:56:14.950 --> 03:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
in order to do things like mitigation
 
03:56:16.389 --> 03:56:16.399 align:start position:0%
um and making sure that you don't have
 
03:56:17.790 --> 03:56:17.800 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts and what happens
 
03:56:19.670 --> 03:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
if you do have environmental impacts
 
03:56:21.349 --> 03:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
there'll be a whole series of Provisions
 
03:56:24.870 --> 03:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
around that as well as things like your
 
03:56:27.070 --> 03:56:27.080 align:start position:0%
financing and how you lock in your
 
03:56:28.630 --> 03:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
financing and what do you have to show
 
03:56:32.189 --> 03:56:32.199 align:start position:0%
at what point in the process all of that
 
03:56:33.670 --> 03:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
and and then at some point you also have
 
03:56:35.670 --> 03:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
to I think prove that you're you have a
 
03:56:36.870 --> 03:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
market for your
 
03:56:39.309 --> 03:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
electricity um which obviously New
 
03:56:41.670 --> 03:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not participating in that
 
03:56:43.349 --> 03:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
activity that's we're not part of that
 
03:56:45.630 --> 03:56:45.640 align:start position:0%
activity we don't do procurements here
 
03:56:48.030 --> 03:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
but our surrounding states in Maine and
 
03:56:50.349 --> 03:56:50.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts will be doing procurements
 
03:56:53.030 --> 03:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
and so they may be um you know actually
 
03:56:55.229 --> 03:56:55.239 align:start position:0%
having those those negotiations with
 
03:56:57.670 --> 03:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
developers as they develop their
 
03:57:00.349 --> 03:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
leases we'll be keeping close tabs on
 
03:57:03.750 --> 03:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
that as well so the over the course of
 
03:57:05.670 --> 03:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
60 days or so they'll have a public
 
03:57:07.229 --> 03:57:07.239 align:start position:0%
comment period on this proposed sale
 
03:57:10.670 --> 03:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
notific notice they'll then at some
 
03:57:12.670 --> 03:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
point in the fall they will actually
 
03:57:15.710 --> 03:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
hold the the lease off auction they'll
 
03:57:17.950 --> 03:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
hold the lease auction they'll they'll
 
03:57:20.670 --> 03:57:20.680 align:start position:0%
award those leases and those leases will
 
03:57:24.389 --> 03:57:24.399 align:start position:0%
be issued by the end of this calendar
 
03:57:26.910 --> 03:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
year so when I said we're sort of at the
 
03:57:30.030 --> 03:57:30.040 align:start position:0%
end of the beginning this is bringing us
 
03:57:31.550 --> 03:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
to the point at which you're launching
 
03:57:34.189 --> 03:57:34.199 align:start position:0%
into somebody actually owns a
 
03:57:37.429 --> 03:57:37.439 align:start position:0%
lease once they have that lease then
 
03:57:39.070 --> 03:57:39.080 align:start position:0%
they have to start doing all of the
 
03:57:42.510 --> 03:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
background work in order to understand
 
03:57:43.710 --> 03:57:43.720 align:start position:0%
where you're actually going to put the
 
03:57:43.720 --> 03:57:44.790 align:start position:0%
where you're actually going to put the
turbine

03:57:44.790 --> 03:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
turbine
 
03:57:45.950 --> 03:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
how many
 
03:57:47.990 --> 03:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
turbines you know uh you're going to
 
03:57:50.349 --> 03:57:50.359 align:start position:0%
have to have areas to be able to to get
 
03:57:52.990 --> 03:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
ships through you have to identify where
 
03:57:54.710 --> 03:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
your transmission cables are going to go
 
03:57:56.590 --> 03:57:56.600 align:start position:0%
at that point where they're going to go
 
03:57:59.309 --> 03:57:59.319 align:start position:0%
on land begin to have all of those
 
03:58:01.149 --> 03:58:01.159 align:start position:0%
preparations that becomes part of your
 
03:58:03.990 --> 03:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
constructions and operations plan all of
 
03:58:06.510 --> 03:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
that will take probably out until
 
03:58:09.590 --> 03:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
another five years or so to get through
 
03:58:12.429 --> 03:58:12.439 align:start position:0%
and then there would be opportunities
 
03:58:14.149 --> 03:58:14.159 align:start position:0%
for construction there'll be met Towers
 
03:58:17.189 --> 03:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
they go up over time yes uh Mr chair do
 
03:58:19.189 --> 03:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
developers have to start paying on those
 
03:58:21.950 --> 03:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
leases as soon as they're signed my
 
03:58:23.590 --> 03:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
understanding is that you pay some I'm
 
03:58:24.830 --> 03:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
not sure if you pay all of it I think
 
03:58:26.630 --> 03:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
you actually pay all of it like I think
 
03:58:29.269 --> 03:58:29.279 align:start position:0%
you pay for the lease um so that's the
 
03:58:30.630 --> 03:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
way it's worked in other places like in
 
03:58:32.510 --> 03:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
the Gulf of Mexico they just did a lease
 
03:58:34.750 --> 03:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
which was really uh there were very few
 
03:58:36.510 --> 03:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
people who wanted to bid on that but
 
03:58:38.389 --> 03:58:38.399 align:start position:0%
they did actually sell it it was like I
 
03:58:40.070 --> 03:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
think it was like $4 million or
 
03:58:42.990 --> 03:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
something but in New York bite when they
 
03:58:46.630 --> 03:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
sold them they them for $500 million so
 
03:58:47.990 --> 03:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's a big company with lots of
 
03:58:52.790 --> 03:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
financing that can do that thank you yes
 
03:58:55.550 --> 03:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
does all of this do the developers are
 
03:58:57.910 --> 03:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
are they responsible for all of this leg
 
03:59:00.670 --> 03:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
work that you're describing and you know
 
03:59:02.630 --> 03:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
and what what role does the New
 
03:59:04.830 --> 03:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire office of offshore wind
 
03:59:07.070 --> 03:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
development have great great questions
 
03:59:07.080 --> 03:59:08.189 align:start position:0%
development have great great questions
so

03:59:08.189 --> 03:59:08.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:59:10.550 --> 03:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
yes there's it's it's heavy on the
 
03:59:11.990 --> 03:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
federal government because remember this
 
03:59:14.670 --> 03:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
is in federal waters so they have
 
03:59:17.110 --> 03:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over all of this activity
 
03:59:19.229 --> 03:59:19.239 align:start position:0%
because it's out in federal waters the
 
03:59:21.110 --> 03:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
state does not have any jurisdiction at
 
03:59:24.229 --> 03:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
this moment over what would happen out
 
03:59:25.910 --> 03:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
in the Gulf of Maine Beyond three
 
03:59:25.920 --> 03:59:27.750 align:start position:0%
in the Gulf of Maine Beyond three
nautical

03:59:27.750 --> 03:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
nautical
 
03:59:32.830 --> 03:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
miles the so so our role at this point
 
03:59:35.229 --> 03:59:35.239 align:start position:0%
has really been to make sure that our
 
03:59:37.630 --> 03:59:37.640 align:start position:0%
stakeholders who might be
 
03:59:40.790 --> 03:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
impacted positively or negatively bu
 
03:59:43.630 --> 03:59:43.640 align:start position:0%
this kind of activity have lots and lots
 
03:59:45.510 --> 03:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
of information information and the other
 
03:59:46.870 --> 03:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
thing that we've been doing is making
 
03:59:48.910 --> 03:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
sure that we are well coordinated as a
 
03:59:52.110 --> 03:59:52.120 align:start position:0%
state between Dees we are handling sort
 
03:59:54.510 --> 03:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
of the offshore sighting stuff in
 
03:59:56.790 --> 03:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
cooperation with fishing game fishing
 
03:59:58.870 --> 03:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
game has a very strong role to play on
 
04:00:00.990 --> 04:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
this for two things one is fisheries
 
04:00:03.110 --> 04:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
habitat and the other is the people who
 
04:00:04.870 --> 04:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
utilize Fisheries Habitat to make a
 
04:00:08.149 --> 04:00:08.159 align:start position:0%
living so our fishing industry so so
 
04:00:09.910 --> 04:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
we've been well coordinated with them
 
04:00:12.189 --> 04:00:12.199 align:start position:0%
the office of energy and planning that
 
04:00:14.710 --> 04:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
side is really much more sort of a a
 
04:00:17.269 --> 04:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
comprehensive approach looking across
 
04:00:19.630 --> 04:00:19.640 align:start position:0%
all of the agencies and really focused
 
04:00:22.110 --> 04:00:22.120 align:start position:0%
on the energy side and I think you're
 
04:00:24.429 --> 04:00:24.439 align:start position:0%
going to see a lot of uh activity in the
 
04:00:28.750 --> 04:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
next weeks as ISO New England uh
 
04:00:32.389 --> 04:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
releases a new kind of uh long-term plan
 
04:00:34.950 --> 04:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
for for transmission when they release
 
04:00:37.070 --> 04:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
that it's going to include some
 
04:00:39.469 --> 04:00:39.479 align:start position:0%
conclusions that they've made about how
 
04:00:42.149 --> 04:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
to plan for offshore wind and so that's
 
04:00:43.990 --> 04:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
going to be really interesting to watch
 
04:00:45.550 --> 04:00:45.560 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of transmission
 
04:00:47.750 --> 04:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
issues which we could do an entire
 
04:00:50.269 --> 04:00:50.279 align:start position:0%
couple hours on transmission issues uh
 
04:00:52.590 --> 04:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
related to this activity because it's
 
04:00:54.309 --> 04:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lot going on there but I would
 
04:00:56.950 --> 04:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
let our Brethren from from Department of
 
04:00:58.710 --> 04:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
energy talk about that because they have
 
04:01:01.590 --> 04:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
people that are qualified and then the
 
04:01:06.189 --> 04:01:06.199 align:start position:0%
the uh Bea is also in uh in involved and
 
04:01:09.389 --> 04:01:09.399 align:start position:0%
looking at Workforce uh development
 
04:01:14.389 --> 04:01:14.399 align:start position:0%
training and making sure that there's um
 
04:01:16.149 --> 04:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire companies get their
 
04:01:18.710 --> 04:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
chunk of the pie um as this
 
04:01:20.750 --> 04:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
multi-billion dollar Investments begin
 
04:01:24.030 --> 04:01:24.040 align:start position:0%
to get made uh offshore yeah you had a
 
04:01:25.189 --> 04:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned that New
 
04:01:26.870 --> 04:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not doing any procurement
 
04:01:28.990 --> 04:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
and our neighboring states are could you
 
04:01:32.030 --> 04:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
could you explain why that is um I uh
 
04:01:34.070 --> 04:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
that that happens at a uh way above my
 
04:01:37.550 --> 04:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
pay grade um my understanding is that
 
04:01:40.550 --> 04:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
that that in this state they they have
 
04:01:42.550 --> 04:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
they we don't have like a renewable
 
04:01:45.309 --> 04:01:45.319 align:start position:0%
portfolio sort of approach so other
 
04:01:47.990 --> 04:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
states are required to to have some
 
04:01:49.550 --> 04:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
portion of their electricity be a
 
04:01:51.870 --> 04:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
certain amount this is what's Driven it
 
04:01:54.269 --> 04:01:54.279 align:start position:0%
in Maine and Massachusetts is that they
 
04:01:57.030 --> 04:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
have to come up with certain
 
04:01:59.429 --> 04:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
renewable amounts of their electrical
 
04:02:02.990 --> 04:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
load and the only way there is only one
 
04:02:04.990 --> 04:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
way in which you can meet those goals
 
04:02:06.389 --> 04:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
and the only way in which you can meet
 
04:02:08.830 --> 04:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
those goals is to procure offshore so
 
04:02:11.710 --> 04:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
that's why it's driving it in other uh
 
04:02:13.269 --> 04:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
and again I'm not an electrical person
 
04:02:14.389 --> 04:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that in New
 
04:02:16.710 --> 04:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have as much electricity as
 
04:02:19.349 --> 04:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
we need um currently that's my
 
04:02:20.550 --> 04:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
understanding but again I don't do this
 
04:02:22.950 --> 04:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
for a living but that has not been the
 
04:02:24.830 --> 04:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
the case in other states where they have
 
04:02:26.950 --> 04:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
these these goals so that's what's
 
04:02:28.710 --> 04:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
driving it at other places Ted can I
 
04:02:30.990 --> 04:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
just yeah go so I would just add that a
 
04:02:33.910 --> 04:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
lot some of our states near us have
 
04:02:36.389 --> 04:02:36.399 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements in terms of zero
 
04:02:38.670 --> 04:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
carbon emissions by specific dates and
 
04:02:40.229 --> 04:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
that's what Ted's really alluding to
 
04:02:42.469 --> 04:02:42.479 align:start position:0%
there to get there you need this type of
 
04:02:45.710 --> 04:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
development right
 
04:02:48.590 --> 04:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
so yeah so so over the next you know
 
04:02:51.469 --> 04:02:51.479 align:start position:0%
basically eight years or so there'll be
 
04:02:53.790 --> 04:02:53.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of process going on the developers
 
04:02:56.710 --> 04:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
will be funding lots and lots of studies
 
04:02:58.670 --> 04:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
um and then at some point they will
 
04:03:00.389 --> 04:03:00.399 align:start position:0%
release they will get their their
 
04:03:02.910 --> 04:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
construction and operation plan approved
 
04:03:04.550 --> 04:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
and at that point they can begin
 
04:03:06.710 --> 04:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
construction so as they say putting
 
04:03:09.309 --> 04:03:09.319 align:start position:0%
steel in the water so down in
 
04:03:11.229 --> 04:03:11.239 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh you you're probably
 
04:03:13.790 --> 04:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
aware that they are starting to spin and
 
04:03:16.030 --> 04:03:16.040 align:start position:0%
generate electrons and so that's now
 
04:03:17.990 --> 04:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
going on to the grid the same thing is
 
04:03:20.670 --> 04:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
going on in Virginia um and you'll see
 
04:03:22.670 --> 04:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
you'll see that that over the next you
 
04:03:25.070 --> 04:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
know over the next few years those those
 
04:03:27.309 --> 04:03:27.319 align:start position:0%
very large wind arrays will come
 
04:03:29.349 --> 04:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
online the only other thing I would
 
04:03:32.149 --> 04:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
point out in terms of the leasing
 
04:03:37.309 --> 04:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
process um is is that um uh state of
 
04:03:39.830 --> 04:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
Maine also has a lease that they are
 
04:03:42.790 --> 04:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
seeking for a research array which is
 
04:03:46.830 --> 04:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
way up down almost down east uh Maine
 
04:03:48.510 --> 04:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
and that will be an area in which
 
04:03:49.910 --> 04:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
there'll be something like eight
 
04:03:53.550 --> 04:03:53.560 align:start position:0%
turbines and it'll be a test facility uh
 
04:03:55.750 --> 04:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
for understanding some of the unanswered
 
04:03:57.469 --> 04:03:57.479 align:start position:0%
questions that currently exist with
 
04:04:01.229 --> 04:04:01.239 align:start position:0%
floating technology such as you know how
 
04:04:03.110 --> 04:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
do you deal with emfs from the
 
04:04:05.590 --> 04:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
transmission cables is that a thing how
 
04:04:07.630 --> 04:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
do you connect them uh from cable to
 
04:04:09.110 --> 04:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
Cable how do you connect them to the
 
04:04:11.269 --> 04:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
bottom what technologies are going to be
 
04:04:14.149 --> 04:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
employed how do fish react to things
 
04:04:16.790 --> 04:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
like offshore wind in the Gulf of Maine
 
04:04:18.670 --> 04:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
those will be part of the research array
 
04:04:20.790 --> 04:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
and that will be um there's there's a
 
04:04:23.630 --> 04:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
significant effort in Maine to create
 
04:04:26.389 --> 04:04:26.399 align:start position:0%
that sort of a facility uh and they're
 
04:04:27.950 --> 04:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
working their way through this lease
 
04:04:30.110 --> 04:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
process my guess is that will lease will
 
04:04:32.590 --> 04:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
also be finalized by the end of the year
 
04:04:34.110 --> 04:04:34.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative yeah it sounds like
 
04:04:35.670 --> 04:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
so we're planning to do something that
 
04:04:37.349 --> 04:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
has not been done
 
04:04:37.359 --> 04:04:39.189 align:start position:0%
has not been done
before

04:04:39.189 --> 04:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:04:41.550 --> 04:04:41.560 align:start position:0%
um I wouldn't say it hasn't been done it
 
04:04:43.149 --> 04:04:43.159 align:start position:0%
hasn't been done at the scale of an
 
04:04:45.830 --> 04:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
industrial scale and I think that that's
 
04:04:48.189 --> 04:04:48.199 align:start position:0%
and certainly the you know North the
 
04:04:51.269 --> 04:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
North Shore of Scotland is somewhat
 
04:04:54.309 --> 04:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
different than the Gulf of Maine um
 
04:04:57.110 --> 04:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
though both North Atlantic sort of
 
04:05:02.389 --> 04:05:02.399 align:start position:0%
enviros um so yeah it is this is this is
 
04:05:04.910 --> 04:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
at the bleeding edge of current
 
04:05:06.630 --> 04:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
technologies that are employed but
 
04:05:08.229 --> 04:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
they're not that different as I
 
04:05:10.830 --> 04:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
understand it and again that's another
 
04:05:13.750 --> 04:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
really fascinating uh the whole set
 
04:05:17.349 --> 04:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
talking about the technology but as I
 
04:05:18.990 --> 04:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
understand it it's not that different
 
04:05:21.110 --> 04:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
from the technologies that are employed
 
04:05:23.229 --> 04:05:23.239 align:start position:0%
currently for floating platforms for oil
 
04:05:24.349 --> 04:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
and gas
 
04:05:26.309 --> 04:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
exploration the size is a little
 
04:05:27.550 --> 04:05:27.560 align:start position:0%
different the scale is a little
 
04:05:29.870 --> 04:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
different the fact that it has a th foot
 
04:05:32.429 --> 04:05:32.439 align:start position:0%
Tower uh sitting on the top with a giant
 
04:05:35.389 --> 04:05:35.399 align:start position:0%
blade on it makes it a little different
 
04:05:37.830 --> 04:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh but it's not that different um as I
 
04:05:39.349 --> 04:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
understand it from a sort of technical
 
04:05:41.349 --> 04:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
perspective ocean engineering
 
04:05:44.830 --> 04:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
perspective from current very deep water
 
04:05:47.229 --> 04:05:47.239 align:start position:0%
you know thousand foot depth uh oil and
 
04:05:51.269 --> 04:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
gas uh you know exploration yeah is the
 
04:05:53.030 --> 04:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
main pilot project also going to have
 
04:05:55.070 --> 04:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
floating yes okay that was the that's
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
kind of the whole point is to make sure
 
04:05:58.750 --> 04:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
that it reflects what will be the
 
04:06:01.710 --> 04:06:01.720 align:start position:0%
reality in the Gulf of Maine so they'll
 
04:06:03.510 --> 04:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
be moving along just I just have the
 
04:06:04.990 --> 04:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
slide in there because it kind of talks
 
04:06:06.870 --> 04:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
about what we've been doing as a state
 
04:06:09.630 --> 04:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
to prepare our stakeholders for the
 
04:06:11.870 --> 04:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
eventuality that we would have offshore
 
04:06:14.110 --> 04:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
wind and I will say
 
04:06:15.950 --> 04:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
the what we've been focusing on as a
 
04:06:17.469 --> 04:06:17.479 align:start position:0%
state and we created a little group
 
04:06:18.710 --> 04:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
called The stakeholder Outreach work
 
04:06:21.269 --> 04:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
Group which we've got a agency
 
04:06:22.910 --> 04:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
involvement from each of the
 
04:06:25.229 --> 04:06:25.239 align:start position:0%
agencies is that it's been on process
 
04:06:28.429 --> 04:06:28.439 align:start position:0%
process process because what this this
 
04:06:30.950 --> 04:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
whole thing of getting these leases in
 
04:06:33.750 --> 04:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
in place is a whole series of different
 
04:06:36.389 --> 04:06:36.399 align:start position:0%
processes that all link together and so
 
04:06:38.429 --> 04:06:38.439 align:start position:0%
what we've been doing is educating
 
04:06:40.750 --> 04:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholders about the process so that
 
04:06:42.349 --> 04:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
they can be involved and I say it's been
 
04:06:44.950 --> 04:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
very successful the the letter that
 
04:06:47.070 --> 04:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
eventually came out in terms of comments
 
04:06:49.830 --> 04:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
from our New Hampshire uh commercial
 
04:06:49.840 --> 04:06:51.510 align:start position:0%
from our New Hampshire uh commercial
Fisheries

04:06:51.510 --> 04:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
Fisheries
 
04:06:54.469 --> 04:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
Association it was highly influential
 
04:06:56.229 --> 04:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
with a decision- making about where to
 
04:06:58.670 --> 04:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
put these wind energy areas and that was
 
04:07:01.349 --> 04:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
because I think to a great extent the
 
04:07:03.630 --> 04:07:03.640 align:start position:0%
work that we've done over the years of
 
04:07:05.630 --> 04:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
making sure that we had a really close
 
04:07:07.349 --> 04:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
collaboration between our fishermen and
 
04:07:09.189 --> 04:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
our government and so I'm really proud
 
04:07:10.550 --> 04:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
of that and I'm really proud of where
 
04:07:14.269 --> 04:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
We've Ended up in that process
 
04:07:16.189 --> 04:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
just a couple of other places that I
 
04:07:18.189 --> 04:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
would just note um doe the wind
 
04:07:20.870 --> 04:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
development director is currently vacant
 
04:07:23.070 --> 04:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
um and so that's a position that that
 
04:07:24.630 --> 04:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully will get filled because that
 
04:07:27.149 --> 04:07:27.159 align:start position:0%
does provide sort of that overarching
 
04:07:29.189 --> 04:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
sort of keeping track of things as well
 
04:07:33.389 --> 04:07:33.399 align:start position:0%
as the linkage back to energy itself and
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
so what we've done right now in the
 
04:07:37.710 --> 04:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
absence of that is that we have our
 
04:07:39.109 --> 04:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
group that we're coordinating I'm
 
04:07:40.910 --> 04:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
spending a lot of time on this as is
 
04:07:42.830 --> 04:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
Chris Elms who's their uh deputy
 
04:07:42.840 --> 04:07:44.109 align:start position:0%
Chris Elms who's their uh deputy
director

04:07:44.109 --> 04:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
director
 
04:07:46.670 --> 04:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
and so between us and between the staff
 
04:07:49.030 --> 04:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
at the four different agencies uh I
 
04:07:51.590 --> 04:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
think we have a pretty good coverage on
 
04:07:53.269 --> 04:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
you know what's going on and and they've
 
04:07:55.630 --> 04:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
been bringing their grid staff uh to
 
04:07:56.990 --> 04:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
these meetings which has been really
 
04:07:59.349 --> 04:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
helpful uh for the energy
 
04:08:02.590 --> 04:08:02.600 align:start position:0%
side um Bea now has a person assigned
 
04:08:03.830 --> 04:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
they had had a person and then that
 
04:08:05.429 --> 04:08:05.439 align:start position:0%
person left so they now have a person
 
04:08:07.670 --> 04:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
assigned uh to work on this so that's
 
04:08:07.680 --> 04:08:08.590 align:start position:0%
assigned uh to work on this so that's
really

04:08:08.590 --> 04:08:08.600 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:08:11.149 --> 04:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
great you're probably aware and maybe
 
04:08:14.189 --> 04:08:14.199 align:start position:0%
some of you sit on the off Shore wind
 
04:08:16.950 --> 04:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
commission uh that Senator Waters put
 
04:08:19.389 --> 04:08:19.399 align:start position:0%
together a few years back that also has
 
04:08:22.309 --> 04:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
been really helpful to be able to keep
 
04:08:24.590 --> 04:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
coordinated across both agencies
 
04:08:27.469 --> 04:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
localities and other parties such as the
 
04:08:30.630 --> 04:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
labor unions uh and the Port Authority
 
04:08:32.550 --> 04:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
all of that kind of hits together
 
04:08:34.309 --> 04:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
because this touches lots of different
 
04:08:37.389 --> 04:08:37.399 align:start position:0%
aspects of of Coastal
 
04:08:40.550 --> 04:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
Life couple of other things I guess um
 
04:08:42.189 --> 04:08:42.199 align:start position:0%
there was recently a report that was
 
04:08:44.590 --> 04:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
done uh by Norm Associates in
 
04:08:46.389 --> 04:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
partnership with another bunch of other
 
04:08:48.349 --> 04:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
folks I can send that link around to you
 
04:08:50.870 --> 04:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
all it's a really uh I think
 
04:08:53.109 --> 04:08:53.119 align:start position:0%
comprehensive articulation of all the
 
04:08:56.269 --> 04:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
sort of positives pluses and minuses the
 
04:08:59.309 --> 04:08:59.319 align:start position:0%
pros and cons of offshore win two New
 
04:09:01.269 --> 04:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how does it relate directly to
 
04:09:03.389 --> 04:09:03.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I can send that around
 
04:09:04.550 --> 04:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
it's very
 
04:09:07.109 --> 04:09:07.119 align:start position:0%
comprehensive it's it's I think it's 500
 
04:09:09.670 --> 04:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
pages or something like that but if if
 
04:09:11.389 --> 04:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
you look at it a little bit at a time
 
04:09:12.630 --> 04:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
especially if you're interested in
 
04:09:15.030 --> 04:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
looking something up um it's actually
 
04:09:16.389 --> 04:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
really helpful and there's a lot of
 
04:09:17.830 --> 04:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
really good information in there so I'll
 
04:09:20.189 --> 04:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
send that link around as well that was
 
04:09:23.229 --> 04:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
completed last uh last
 
04:09:25.229 --> 04:09:25.239 align:start position:0%
fall and then the last thing I would
 
04:09:29.389 --> 04:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
note is that um there's a compensatory
 
04:09:32.750 --> 04:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
mitigation uh requests for proposals out
 
04:09:35.790 --> 04:09:35.800 align:start position:0%
on the street uh originally nine states
 
04:09:38.670 --> 04:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
and now 11 states have joined together
 
04:09:42.349 --> 04:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
to create a structure an administrator
 
04:09:45.790 --> 04:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
for a compr for compensatory mitigation
 
04:09:48.750 --> 04:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
dollars for Fisheries so assuming that
 
04:09:52.550 --> 04:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
there's going to be fishering fishing
 
04:09:55.149 --> 04:09:55.159 align:start position:0%
displaced by these turbines that they
 
04:09:57.630 --> 04:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
won't be able to fish in some of those
 
04:10:00.149 --> 04:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
areas making that assumption and that
 
04:10:01.950 --> 04:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
that will have some economic impact on
 
04:10:03.870 --> 04:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
both fishermen and the industry that
 
04:10:07.389 --> 04:10:07.399 align:start position:0%
support them that that there there will
 
04:10:09.550 --> 04:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
need to be compensatory mitigation for
 
04:10:09.560 --> 04:10:10.590 align:start position:0%
need to be compensatory mitigation for
those

04:10:10.590 --> 04:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:10:13.550 --> 04:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
folks um nobody likes to talk about this
 
04:10:16.429 --> 04:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
because it's hard um because we don't
 
04:10:17.910 --> 04:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
want those kinds of impacts and we're
 
04:10:19.389 --> 04:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
trying to do all the minimization and
 
04:10:21.950 --> 04:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
avoidances possible but it is possible
 
04:10:24.990 --> 04:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
that there will be uh impacts over time
 
04:10:27.750 --> 04:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
and so the developers will have to put
 
04:10:29.510 --> 04:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
dollars into these compensatory
 
04:10:32.309 --> 04:10:32.319 align:start position:0%
mitigation accounts and so what's being
 
04:10:35.269 --> 04:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
developed right now is an RFQ to De to
 
04:10:37.950 --> 04:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
develop an administrator that will serve
 
04:10:39.870 --> 04:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
those this is largely being driven by
 
04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
nerta that is the the the authority
 
04:10:43.710 --> 04:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
within the the bite of new New York
 
04:10:46.429 --> 04:10:46.439 align:start position:0%
that's doing all the wind work down
 
04:10:48.550 --> 04:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
there they're at the point where they're
 
04:10:49.910 --> 04:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
actually starting to get mitigation
 
04:10:51.790 --> 04:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
dollars coming in the door and so
 
04:10:53.790 --> 04:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
they're going to need an efficient and
 
04:10:56.429 --> 04:10:56.439 align:start position:0%
effective way and the reason why the 11
 
04:10:58.950 --> 04:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
states kind of came together to do this
 
04:11:00.469 --> 04:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
is that we have people from New
 
04:11:02.109 --> 04:11:02.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who fish off of the coast of
 
04:11:04.349 --> 04:11:04.359 align:start position:0%
New Jersey people from New Jersey have
 
04:11:06.830 --> 04:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
Co have have fishermen who who fish out
 
04:11:11.309 --> 04:11:11.319 align:start position:0%
in Cash's ledge so we this is this is so
 
04:11:12.790 --> 04:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the fishery there's
 
04:11:15.790 --> 04:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
not a State fishery it is a regional
 
04:11:17.870 --> 04:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
fishery and that's why this mitigation
 
04:11:20.550 --> 04:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
is coming together so that's kind of the
 
04:11:22.830 --> 04:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
goings on right now it's pretty exciting
 
04:11:25.070 --> 04:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
time in the wind world uh and I can try
 
04:11:26.870 --> 04:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
to answer any other questions you might
 
04:11:30.349 --> 04:11:30.359 align:start position:0%
have John lewi has a question thank you
 
04:11:33.870 --> 04:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
um has anybody had one of these floating
 
04:11:36.910 --> 04:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
um platforms wind uh turbines anywhere
 
04:11:38.469 --> 04:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
in the world where they got something
 
04:11:41.269 --> 04:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
the equivalent of a North Atlantic
 
04:11:43.429 --> 04:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
hurricane my understanding is that there
 
04:11:47.590 --> 04:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
are some off the coast of the UK so
 
04:11:49.670 --> 04:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
their weather you know I would imagine
 
04:11:54.630 --> 04:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
is relatively brutal um but again um I
 
04:11:56.830 --> 04:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
the these are some of the one of the
 
04:11:59.510 --> 04:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
interesting things is that the country
 
04:12:02.670 --> 04:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
of Norway uh is actually really
 
04:12:04.670 --> 04:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
providing a lot of technical assistance
 
04:12:08.309 --> 04:12:08.319 align:start position:0%
to the rest of the world on uh offshore
 
04:12:10.870 --> 04:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
wind um and so they're positioning
 
04:12:13.790 --> 04:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
themselves sort of to be able to do that
 
04:12:16.389 --> 04:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
and so there's a partnership we've
 
04:12:18.630 --> 04:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
actually have with Norway and if for
 
04:12:20.030 --> 04:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
things like that if you're ever really
 
04:12:22.590 --> 04:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
interested in that we can uh Identify
 
04:12:25.469 --> 04:12:25.479 align:start position:0%
some some folks to for you to speak with
 
04:12:27.229 --> 04:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
about you know kind of where the state
 
04:12:31.269 --> 04:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:34.349 --> 04:12:34.359 align:start position:0%
today representative Ms has a question
 
04:12:37.349 --> 04:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
thank you um there a lot of different
 
04:12:39.670 --> 04:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire agencies involved in this
 
04:12:42.109 --> 04:12:42.119 align:start position:0%
in this process it's a big undertaking
 
04:12:46.630 --> 04:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
complicated is there one agency that is
 
04:12:50.469 --> 04:12:50.479 align:start position:0%
in charge like the the the go-to place
 
04:12:53.510 --> 04:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
um the the the agency that's kind of you
 
04:12:56.030 --> 04:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
know quarterbacking the whole effort
 
04:12:59.309 --> 04:12:59.319 align:start position:0%
yeah so right now I think uh I would say
 
04:13:02.870 --> 04:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
that because of the focus on up until
 
04:13:04.269 --> 04:13:04.279 align:start position:0%
this point on
 
04:13:07.670 --> 04:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
sighting that Dees has been extremely
 
04:13:09.550 --> 04:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
involved in that process because it's
 
04:13:13.229 --> 04:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
largely an offshore resource issue and
 
04:13:15.670 --> 04:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
because we are because of our federal
 
04:13:17.910 --> 04:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
consistency provisions of the federal of
 
04:13:19.630 --> 04:13:19.640 align:start position:0%
the the coastal zone management act
 
04:13:22.510 --> 04:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
which is a federal act we play a very
 
04:13:25.790 --> 04:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
strong role in that process as do our
 
04:13:29.229 --> 04:13:29.239 align:start position:0%
other Coastal States and so we work very
 
04:13:31.990 --> 04:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
closely with those other states on that
 
04:13:33.710 --> 04:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
offshore sighting as well as with fish
 
04:13:36.830 --> 04:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
and game so today in the process because
 
04:13:39.670 --> 04:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
the process is so driven on offshore
 
04:13:42.389 --> 04:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
information and resources Dees has
 
04:13:46.309 --> 04:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
largely led the effort for the state at
 
04:13:48.269 --> 04:13:48.279 align:start position:0%
some point pretty
 
04:13:51.030 --> 04:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
soon this is be going to become much
 
04:13:53.830 --> 04:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
more of an energy thing and as that
 
04:13:56.309 --> 04:13:56.319 align:start position:0%
starts to occur then I think that you'll
 
04:13:59.670 --> 04:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
see that office of offshore uh develop
 
04:14:01.590 --> 04:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
offshore wind development I can't
 
04:14:04.030 --> 04:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
remember what they call it now um that
 
04:14:05.910 --> 04:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
that office will become probably more
 
04:14:08.309 --> 04:14:08.319 align:start position:0%
key in some of this so but I would just
 
04:14:10.670 --> 04:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
say that at this point the interaction
 
04:14:12.469 --> 04:14:12.479 align:start position:0%
between the state has between the state
 
04:14:14.070 --> 04:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
agencies has been rather
 
04:14:16.750 --> 04:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
seamless so we've been working very very
 
04:14:18.229 --> 04:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
very closely and we are aware of what
 
04:14:19.349 --> 04:14:19.359 align:start position:0%
each other is
 
04:14:21.429 --> 04:14:21.439 align:start position:0%
doing so if you want to know what's
 
04:14:23.950 --> 04:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
going on if you want to go to somebody
 
04:14:25.510 --> 04:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
you can come to me or you can come to
 
04:14:27.309 --> 04:14:27.319 align:start position:0%
Chris Elms because right now we're
 
04:14:33.030 --> 04:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:35.550 --> 04:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
that representative Reynolds has a
 
04:14:39.109 --> 04:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman um not
 
04:14:41.790 --> 04:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
withstanding all the all the talk here
 
04:14:43.109 --> 04:14:43.119 align:start position:0%
including your presence of course of
 
04:14:45.510 --> 04:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
course uh all the talk about all the
 
04:14:47.830 --> 04:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
government agencies federal government
 
04:14:51.349 --> 04:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
state government coordination in this
 
04:14:54.189 --> 04:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
process of the development of offshore
 
04:14:54.199 --> 04:14:56.510 align:start position:0%
process of the development of offshore
wind

04:14:56.510 --> 04:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
wind
 
04:15:00.469 --> 04:15:00.479 align:start position:0%
energy isn't it true that ultimately the
 
04:15:03.990 --> 04:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
parties that are going to build and
 
04:15:07.229 --> 04:15:07.239 align:start position:0%
operate the offshore turbin and the
 
04:15:10.550 --> 04:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
transmission lines that connect them to
 
04:15:13.189 --> 04:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
the grid isn't that going to be private
 
04:15:15.670 --> 04:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
entities isn't that private Capital
 
04:15:19.030 --> 04:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
investing in this energy resource
 
04:15:22.710 --> 04:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah okay thanks just wanted
 
04:15:22.720 --> 04:15:26.269 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah okay thanks just wanted
to

04:15:26.269 --> 04:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:30.550 --> 04:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
clarify okay thank you very much thank
 
04:15:33.670 --> 04:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
you well thank you Ted that was
 
04:15:36.429 --> 04:15:36.439 align:start position:0%
fascinating only took him a half hour to
 
04:15:39.389 --> 04:15:39.399 align:start position:0%
do two slides so at that pace I hope
 
04:15:42.710 --> 04:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
you're all had dinner too just I'm just
 
04:15:44.630 --> 04:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
kidding so I'll ask Mike to come back up
 
04:15:46.109 --> 04:15:46.119 align:start position:0%
and join me Mike and I are going to tag
 
04:15:48.910 --> 04:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
team a base presentation that we
 
04:15:51.149 --> 04:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
actually gave to you folks a little over
 
04:15:54.429 --> 04:15:54.439 align:start position:0%
a year ago in January of 2023 we're not
 
04:15:56.670 --> 04:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
going to hit every talking point we want
 
04:15:58.750 --> 04:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
to keep this kind of moving along but
 
04:16:00.429 --> 04:16:00.439 align:start position:0%
feel free to raise your hand slow us
 
04:16:02.710 --> 04:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
down if you want us to clarify something
 
04:16:04.550 --> 04:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
so first I would just introduce the
 
04:16:06.189 --> 04:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
division's leadership team here on this
 
04:16:09.469 --> 04:16:09.479 align:start position:0%
slide here um I would encourage anybody
 
04:16:11.269 --> 04:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
to reach out to any one of these folks
 
04:16:13.550 --> 04:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
with any question if they can't answer
 
04:16:14.830 --> 04:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
it they're going to find somebody that
 
04:16:17.149 --> 04:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
can answer the question for you by my
 
04:16:19.590 --> 04:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
calculation this group has about 150
 
04:16:21.630 --> 04:16:21.640 align:start position:0%
years of service uh to the state of New
 
04:16:24.070 --> 04:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at the department so uh very
 
04:16:27.469 --> 04:16:27.479 align:start position:0%
seasoned group here so
 
04:16:29.910 --> 04:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
Mike so this is just an organizational
 
04:16:32.429 --> 04:16:32.439 align:start position:0%
chart of the air Resources Division um
 
04:16:33.870 --> 04:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to run through everything
 
04:16:36.590 --> 04:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
here but it gives you by what each one
 
04:16:39.189 --> 04:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
of these groups do on a daily basis
 
04:16:41.550 --> 04:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
where their areas of expertise are what
 
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
parts of the laws they implement
 
04:16:45.189 --> 04:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
um we're going to hit on them a little
 
04:16:47.149 --> 04:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
bit later on so again I'm not going to
 
04:16:49.030 --> 04:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
go into this the only thing I'll point
 
04:16:50.670 --> 04:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
out is the director's office to the
 
04:16:52.790 --> 04:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
frite we don't consider that a bureau
 
04:16:54.910 --> 04:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
obviously um but we do more than just
 
04:16:56.630 --> 04:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
division management and budgeting we
 
04:16:58.670 --> 04:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
have some technical programs uh in the
 
04:17:00.910 --> 04:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
director's office as all as well and
 
04:17:02.469 --> 04:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about those as well
 
04:17:04.070 --> 04:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
I am just going to point out the Small
 
04:17:06.070 --> 04:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
Business technical assistance program on
 
04:17:08.429 --> 04:17:08.439 align:start position:0%
the bottom right here uh that's Sarah
 
04:17:10.109 --> 04:17:10.119 align:start position:0%
Johnson that's a federal cleaner act
 
04:17:12.349 --> 04:17:12.359 align:start position:0%
required program it was in the
 
04:17:14.670 --> 04:17:14.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner office until last year and
 
04:17:16.389 --> 04:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
then it moved back to the air Resources
 
04:17:18.429 --> 04:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
Division so we're very happy to have
 
04:17:20.189 --> 04:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
Sarah back working for us and she
 
04:17:22.469 --> 04:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
provides free service the small
 
04:17:24.469 --> 04:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
businesses trying to understand very
 
04:17:27.429 --> 04:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
regulations just as an overview um the
 
04:17:32.349 --> 04:17:32.359 align:start position:0%
air Resources Division not only
 
04:17:34.830 --> 04:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
implements state laws we implement the
 
04:17:36.870 --> 04:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
vast majority of federal Clean Air Act
 
04:17:39.189 --> 04:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
laws including monitoring for air
 
04:17:40.990 --> 04:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
pollution developing and maintaining
 
04:17:43.109 --> 04:17:43.119 align:start position:0%
strategies to make sure that we meet
 
04:17:44.990 --> 04:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
those air quality standards that's our
 
04:17:47.030 --> 04:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
job one is to make sure that New
 
04:17:48.550 --> 04:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire meets those Federal air
 
04:17:50.510 --> 04:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
quality standards it's very important to
 
04:17:52.830 --> 04:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
us from a public health standpoint is
 
04:17:55.630 --> 04:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
very important to us from a business
 
04:17:58.149 --> 04:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
standpoint um we currently have 38
 
04:18:00.630 --> 04:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
chapters of administrative rules we've
 
04:18:03.149 --> 04:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
adopted hundreds of federal new source
 
04:18:04.950 --> 04:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
performance standards KNE shaps those
 
04:18:07.189 --> 04:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
are federal hazards they are pollutant
 
04:18:09.309 --> 04:18:09.319 align:start position:0%
standards and Mission guidelines these
 
04:18:11.950 --> 04:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
are largely Federal standards related to
 
04:18:13.910 --> 04:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
Smoke Stack indust indries uh we think
 
04:18:15.550 --> 04:18:15.560 align:start position:0%
it's in everybody's best interest that
 
04:18:17.269 --> 04:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have authority over those
 
04:18:20.030 --> 04:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
programs so we take delegation by of all
 
04:18:22.790 --> 04:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
those programs um Ard Staffing we have
 
04:18:24.990 --> 04:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
71 full-time positions currently around
 
04:18:27.229 --> 04:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
10 vacancies I think that's the lowest
 
04:18:29.910 --> 04:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's been in the last five years so I'm
 
04:18:31.830 --> 04:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
actually pleased that we're getting to
 
04:18:33.070 --> 04:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
that point where we're getting fully
 
04:18:36.309 --> 04:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
staffed again lot of Engineers um
 
04:18:38.550 --> 04:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
environmental Life Sciences atmospheric
 
04:18:41.149 --> 04:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
science types just a lot of technical
 
04:18:44.070 --> 04:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
science and uh back ground as far as the
 
04:18:46.189 --> 04:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
agency we have a couple attorneys that
 
04:18:48.030 --> 04:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
work on our rules and that work in our
 
04:18:50.229 --> 04:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
compliance group as
 
04:18:53.109 --> 04:18:53.119 align:start position:0%
well again I won't run through all these
 
04:18:55.389 --> 04:18:55.399 align:start position:0%
um we implement or responsible for a
 
04:18:56.990 --> 04:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
number of State statutes they're all
 
04:18:58.950 --> 04:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
listed here the ones I would point out
 
04:19:00.790 --> 04:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
that generally are the biggest players
 
04:19:04.229 --> 04:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
for us are RSA 125c that's our general
 
04:19:05.349 --> 04:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
Authority that's where we get our
 
04:19:07.630 --> 04:19:07.640 align:start position:0%
authority to run our air permit programs
 
04:19:09.429 --> 04:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
our enforcement programs General
 
04:19:12.070 --> 04:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
rulemaking Authority um I would also
 
04:19:15.269 --> 04:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
point out our a 125i that's a kind of a
 
04:19:17.030 --> 04:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
unique program the state does have an
 
04:19:20.229 --> 04:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
air toxics uh control program we set
 
04:19:22.070 --> 04:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
health-based standards for over 600
 
04:19:24.750 --> 04:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
compounds that regulated sources need to
 
04:19:27.429 --> 04:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
demonstrate compliance of with I'll also
 
04:19:30.149 --> 04:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
point out RSA 125 that's where we run
 
04:19:33.590 --> 04:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
our Reggie program that's duly run by us
 
04:19:36.429 --> 04:19:36.439 align:start position:0%
and uh the department of energy although
 
04:19:39.070 --> 04:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
Dees does most of the technical work uh
 
04:19:42.429 --> 04:19:42.439 align:start position:0%
doe deals with the money side primarily
 
04:19:44.429 --> 04:19:44.439 align:start position:0%
uh the last program I'll mention is just
 
04:19:47.469 --> 04:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
141e asbest we Implement two Federal
 
04:19:49.510 --> 04:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
asbest programs here at the state and
 
04:19:51.469 --> 04:19:51.479 align:start position:0%
they're in the air Resources Division
 
04:19:53.710 --> 04:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
one is the demolition renovation of
 
04:19:56.349 --> 04:19:56.359 align:start position:0%
existing structures and how you manage
 
04:19:58.070 --> 04:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
ASB best us and get that out before you
 
04:20:00.670 --> 04:20:00.680 align:start position:0%
do that that work and then we also uh
 
04:20:02.830 --> 04:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
implement the federal what we call a her
 
04:20:04.670 --> 04:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
program which is as bestest in schools
 
04:20:06.670 --> 04:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
program there are a number of schools in
 
04:20:08.510 --> 04:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that have as bestus
 
04:20:10.269 --> 04:20:10.279 align:start position:0%
generally the thought process is you're
 
04:20:12.750 --> 04:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
better to leave it in place and properly
 
04:20:15.429 --> 04:20:15.439 align:start position:0%
manage it um than it is to remove it
 
04:20:18.510 --> 04:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:21.590 --> 04:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
so as a Air Pollution Control agency one
 
04:20:23.030 --> 04:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
thing we know is that air pollution
 
04:20:25.710 --> 04:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
Knows No geopolitical Boundaries so we
 
04:20:27.590 --> 04:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
play in a lot of clubs across the
 
04:20:29.590 --> 04:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
country that deal with Air Pollution
 
04:20:31.510 --> 04:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
Control issues we know on some of our
 
04:20:34.149 --> 04:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
worst air quality days the vast majority
 
04:20:35.469 --> 04:20:35.479 align:start position:0%
of pollution in New Hampshire is
 
04:20:37.630 --> 04:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
transported into New Hampshire from out
 
04:20:40.590 --> 04:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
of state uh up wind sources um so we
 
04:20:42.830 --> 04:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
work on a number of multi state
 
04:20:44.990 --> 04:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
organizations probably the one we deal
 
04:20:47.590 --> 04:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
the most with is nescom northeast states
 
04:20:49.309 --> 04:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
coordinated air use management that's
 
04:20:50.990 --> 04:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
the six New England states New York New
 
04:20:53.510 --> 04:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
Jersey lot of success stories there on
 
04:20:56.149 --> 04:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
developing programs uh across multi
 
04:20:58.710 --> 04:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
multi-jurisdictional States I do serve
 
04:21:00.950 --> 04:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
on the board of directors of nescom as
 
04:21:03.109 --> 04:21:03.119 align:start position:0%
do my counterparts across uh New England
 
04:21:05.870 --> 04:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
New York and New Jersey so um we we we
 
04:21:08.109 --> 04:21:08.119 align:start position:0%
get a big saying what goes on there so
 
04:21:09.309 --> 04:21:09.319 align:start position:0%
uh the only other one I'll point out
 
04:21:11.269 --> 04:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
here is the ozone ozone transport
 
04:21:13.109 --> 04:21:13.119 align:start position:0%
commission this is the clean act
 
04:21:14.870 --> 04:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
developed uh program it actually
 
04:21:17.510 --> 04:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
recognizes the fact that no single state
 
04:21:19.670 --> 04:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
is going to deal with ozone pollution it
 
04:21:21.149 --> 04:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
is you need to deal with it on a
 
04:21:23.790 --> 04:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
regional basis this group covers all the
 
04:21:25.630 --> 04:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
states from Maine all the way down to
 
04:21:27.670 --> 04:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
Virginia and we're very active on the
 
04:21:30.349 --> 04:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
OTC level uh and the commissioner at
 
04:21:32.109 --> 04:21:32.119 align:start position:0%
Dees serves on the board of directors
 
04:21:34.070 --> 04:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
for the OTC
 
04:21:37.030 --> 04:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
so state agencies we interact with I
 
04:21:38.990 --> 04:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
can't even name all these state agencies
 
04:21:41.469 --> 04:21:41.479 align:start position:0%
but suffice it to say we're very active
 
04:21:43.950 --> 04:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
we have I believe we extremely good
 
04:21:46.109 --> 04:21:46.119 align:start position:0%
working relationships with all of these
 
04:21:48.590 --> 04:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
agencies uh we work with them on various
 
04:21:50.309 --> 04:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
different types of uh things that are
 
04:21:53.950 --> 04:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
related across program um so we're very
 
04:21:56.109 --> 04:21:56.119 align:start position:0%
pleased with our uh the way we work with
 
04:21:57.790 --> 04:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
these folks and uh they know how to
 
04:21:59.990 --> 04:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
reach us and we know how to reach them
 
04:22:01.550 --> 04:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
one thing beautiful about New Hampshire
 
04:22:03.710 --> 04:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
is that we are a small state relatively
 
04:22:06.149 --> 04:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
speaking and I think the interaction
 
04:22:08.429 --> 04:22:08.439 align:start position:0%
agency not only within the department
 
04:22:10.590 --> 04:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
but across state government is pretty
 
04:22:12.070 --> 04:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
good from what from what I can tell from
 
04:22:15.830 --> 04:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:18.550 --> 04:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
counterparts financially um we have
 
04:22:20.950 --> 04:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
about just under a $14 million operating
 
04:22:24.870 --> 04:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
budget um we're very dependent on fees
 
04:22:26.710 --> 04:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
almost half of our Revenue comes from
 
04:22:29.189 --> 04:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
fees that's either stationary sources
 
04:22:31.950 --> 04:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
folks that we permit espb bestus fee and
 
04:22:34.189 --> 04:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
a very small amount of Motor Vehicle
 
04:22:36.670 --> 04:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
fees uh we're also very reliant on
 
04:22:38.910 --> 04:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
federal grants uh that's the yellow part
 
04:22:40.149 --> 04:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
that's almost
 
04:22:42.670 --> 04:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
38% uh our challenges with the Federal
 
04:22:44.830 --> 04:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
Grant is the our base grants have been
 
04:22:48.750 --> 04:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
level funded for probably 10 15 20 years
 
04:22:51.309 --> 04:22:51.319 align:start position:0%
what I buy today for a dollar isn't what
 
04:22:53.229 --> 04:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
I used to buy so it it's been a
 
04:22:55.229 --> 04:22:55.239 align:start position:0%
challenge in managing uh those federal
 
04:22:57.830 --> 04:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
grants I also just like to point out uh
 
04:22:59.870 --> 04:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
General funds the air division of those
 
04:23:02.429 --> 04:23:02.439 align:start position:0%
71 positions only four of them are
 
04:23:04.309 --> 04:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
General funds here's half of it right
 
04:23:06.550 --> 04:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
here myself and Mike uh so if you're
 
04:23:08.349 --> 04:23:08.359 align:start position:0%
looking for cuts you can start there
 
04:23:08.359 --> 04:23:09.950 align:start position:0%
looking for cuts you can start there
probably

04:23:09.950 --> 04:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
probably
 
04:23:15.469 --> 04:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:17.910 --> 04:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
of and then uh we have two other
 
04:23:19.550 --> 04:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
positions and actually John patali
 
04:23:20.750 --> 04:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
behind me is one of those other
 
04:23:22.990 --> 04:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
positions and Mary buto in our
 
04:23:25.990 --> 04:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
environmental health program so um I the
 
04:23:27.870 --> 04:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
next slide I think is a really important
 
04:23:30.830 --> 04:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
message it it it it I not sure if people
 
04:23:32.550 --> 04:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
understand this totally but maintaining
 
04:23:35.109 --> 04:23:35.119 align:start position:0%
good air quality we think is important
 
04:23:36.750 --> 04:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
not only for the environment but the
 
04:23:39.269 --> 04:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
economy as well um one of the most
 
04:23:41.429 --> 04:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
important things I talked about was it's
 
04:23:43.070 --> 04:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
our job to make sure sure we meet those
 
04:23:45.550 --> 04:23:45.560 align:start position:0%
Federal air quality standards right now
 
04:23:47.309 --> 04:23:47.319 align:start position:0%
we meet all those Federal air quality
 
04:23:49.590 --> 04:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
standards but if we don't meet those
 
04:23:51.149 --> 04:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
Federal air quality standards that's
 
04:23:52.910 --> 04:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
where it becomes an economic impact in
 
04:23:55.149 --> 04:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because we are forced into
 
04:23:57.070 --> 04:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
developing additional regulations to
 
04:23:59.670 --> 04:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
lower emissions and that has a potential
 
04:24:02.269 --> 04:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
impact across the economy of course
 
04:24:03.990 --> 04:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
we're a public health program first and
 
04:24:06.550 --> 04:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
foremost uh clean air helps to decrease
 
04:24:08.750 --> 04:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
health care costs I like to say New
 
04:24:10.109 --> 04:24:10.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a beautiful state I think
 
04:24:11.950 --> 04:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
we all agree with that I think clean air
 
04:24:14.030 --> 04:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
is a good part of that clean air
 
04:24:16.269 --> 04:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
supports our forests our forests support
 
04:24:18.750 --> 04:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
our clean rivers and clean Lakes so to
 
04:24:20.510 --> 04:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
me it's all intertwined into an
 
04:24:24.550 --> 04:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:27.149 --> 04:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
so again I'll just mention this it's
 
04:24:29.469 --> 04:24:29.479 align:start position:0%
epa's responsibility under the Clean Air
 
04:24:31.030 --> 04:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
Act to set what we call these National
 
04:24:32.910 --> 04:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
ambient air quality standards there's a
 
04:24:34.550 --> 04:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
number of pollutants listed here that we
 
04:24:37.750 --> 04:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
have standards for um EPA is required to
 
04:24:39.670 --> 04:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
review those standards every five years
 
04:24:41.109 --> 04:24:41.119 align:start position:0%
under the Clean Air Act they don't
 
04:24:43.109 --> 04:24:43.119 align:start position:0%
always meet that schedule
 
04:24:45.469 --> 04:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
um they do a very scientific approach to
 
04:24:47.070 --> 04:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
establishing what these standards need
 
04:24:51.870 --> 04:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
to be um and they also um like I said uh
 
04:24:53.269 --> 04:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
they supposed to look at them every five
 
04:24:55.710 --> 04:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
years I've never known them to go up
 
04:24:57.429 --> 04:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
I've only only known them to get more
 
04:24:59.790 --> 04:24:59.800 align:start position:0%
stringent over time as science gets
 
04:25:01.349 --> 04:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
better as better understanding of how
 
04:25:03.670 --> 04:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
air pollution impacts the human body
 
04:25:05.429 --> 04:25:05.439 align:start position:0%
these standards tend to get tighter over
 
04:25:06.950 --> 04:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
time and I think we got a graph coming
 
04:25:09.349 --> 04:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
up that will show
 
04:25:11.950 --> 04:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
that again the most important thing is
 
04:25:14.590 --> 04:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
meeting that Federal Airbase standard I
 
04:25:16.670 --> 04:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
think oh sorry this is the right order
 
04:25:18.910 --> 04:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
so um we use the term attainment
 
04:25:20.630 --> 04:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
non-attainment attainment means we meet
 
04:25:22.309 --> 04:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
the standard non-attainment means we
 
04:25:24.910 --> 04:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
don't meet that standard again the
 
04:25:26.429 --> 04:25:26.439 align:start position:0%
important thing we're currently
 
04:25:28.870 --> 04:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
attainment we need to stay in attainment
 
04:25:31.149 --> 04:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
that's our goal Mike uses a great
 
04:25:32.910 --> 04:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
analogy all the time he talks about when
 
04:25:34.910 --> 04:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
you're dieting and you get to your goal
 
04:25:36.750 --> 04:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
weight you can't go back to what you
 
04:25:38.109 --> 04:25:38.119 align:start position:0%
were doing before and eating
 
04:25:39.750 --> 04:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
cheeseburgers and pizza every night
 
04:25:41.910 --> 04:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
right you need to maintain the level of
 
04:25:41.920 --> 04:25:42.910 align:start position:0%
right you need to maintain the level of
effort

04:25:42.910 --> 04:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
effort
 
04:25:44.590 --> 04:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
that's a very important thing that's
 
04:25:46.429 --> 04:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
essentially largely where New Hampshire
 
04:25:48.950 --> 04:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
is in terms of the federal standards is
 
04:25:51.109 --> 04:25:51.119 align:start position:0%
we're in the a maintenance mode you know
 
04:25:52.910 --> 04:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
we need to keep the gains that we've
 
04:25:56.429 --> 04:25:56.439 align:start position:0%
already made and I see a question
 
04:25:59.750 --> 04:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
right thank you d uh so last year when
 
04:26:02.710 --> 04:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
we had the uh the forest fires up in
 
04:26:06.030 --> 04:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
Canada did we go into non-attainment or
 
04:26:09.309 --> 04:26:09.319 align:start position:0%
we were skimming above it or so whether
 
04:26:11.429 --> 04:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
you're in attainment or not attainment
 
04:26:13.550 --> 04:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
it it depends on on the pollutant uh
 
04:26:15.349 --> 04:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
there's different averaging times
 
04:26:16.870 --> 04:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
there's different ways they calculate
 
04:26:20.429 --> 04:26:20.439 align:start position:0%
attainment non attainment um what we had
 
04:26:22.389 --> 04:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
in those situations where several days
 
04:26:25.349 --> 04:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
where we exceeded the standards we
 
04:26:26.750 --> 04:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
certainly were above the health-based
 
04:26:29.510 --> 04:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
standards for PM especially in the Keen
 
04:26:32.070 --> 04:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
area and a few other parts of the states
 
04:26:34.030 --> 04:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
but the numbers weren't high enough to
 
04:26:37.229 --> 04:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
push us into non- attainment yet so
 
04:26:38.710 --> 04:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
because it's basically a three-year
 
04:26:41.269 --> 04:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
average of the highs of the fourth high
 
04:26:43.870 --> 04:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
so there's a mathema iCal formula so it
 
04:26:45.750 --> 04:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
pushed our number up but didn't put us
 
04:26:48.830 --> 04:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
into that situation yet so the other
 
04:26:53.229 --> 04:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
thing with well the new P PM 2.5
 
04:26:57.149 --> 04:26:57.159 align:start position:0%
standard uh cause attainment problems or
 
04:26:59.030 --> 04:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
non- attainment problems I actually
 
04:27:01.149 --> 04:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
meant to put a slide in here right now
 
04:27:04.229 --> 04:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
we believe we still have to complete the
 
04:27:07.030 --> 04:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
basis of that is going to be 2022 2023
 
04:27:10.429 --> 04:27:10.439 align:start position:0%
and 2024 so we need to get through 2024
 
04:27:12.910 --> 04:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
to know for sure but right now we would
 
04:27:14.870 --> 04:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
still meet that new proposed Federal
 
04:27:17.590 --> 04:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
standard so uh the other thing we can
 
04:27:19.149 --> 04:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
say about wood smoke just real real
 
04:27:21.830 --> 04:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
quick uh that's what could be an
 
04:27:24.630 --> 04:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
exceptional event if those events were
 
04:27:27.189 --> 04:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
to push us into non attainment New
 
04:27:29.750 --> 04:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could seek to take those
 
04:27:32.189 --> 04:27:32.199 align:start position:0%
numbers out of our attainment status
 
04:27:33.870 --> 04:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
calculation simply because there's
 
04:27:36.030 --> 04:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
nothing we can do about that that's a
 
04:27:41.109 --> 04:27:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:43.910 --> 04:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
so uh savings Clause that's the no
 
04:27:46.229 --> 04:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
backsliding um that's that's where the
 
04:27:48.710 --> 04:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
diet analogy comes in um you know we're
 
04:27:51.109 --> 04:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
we're largely in that mode um if we
 
04:27:53.870 --> 04:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
don't maintain we we potentially subject
 
04:27:56.349 --> 04:27:56.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to um sanctions those
 
04:27:57.870 --> 04:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
sanctions could either be in federal
 
04:28:00.990 --> 04:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
grants potentially Highway funds or
 
04:28:02.750 --> 04:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
require more stringent permanent
 
04:28:04.349 --> 04:28:04.359 align:start position:0%
requirements for our regulated
 
04:28:07.189 --> 04:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
Industries so we don't want to get there
 
04:28:10.229 --> 04:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
either uh air quality measurements this
 
04:28:12.429 --> 04:28:12.439 align:start position:0%
is about 60% of where we spend our
 
04:28:14.750 --> 04:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
federal money federal grants we get um
 
04:28:17.109 --> 04:28:17.119 align:start position:0%
we operate 13 sites across the state
 
04:28:18.590 --> 04:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
literally from the top of Mount
 
04:28:21.070 --> 04:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
Washington down the Connecticut River
 
04:28:23.109 --> 04:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
Valley across the Southern Tier the Sea
 
04:28:26.269 --> 04:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
Coast up the marac river valley and we
 
04:28:28.790 --> 04:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
have one monitor in lonia which is
 
04:28:30.590 --> 04:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
obviously a very popular place in the
 
04:28:33.309 --> 04:28:33.319 align:start position:0%
summertime so we like to uh monitor
 
04:28:35.790 --> 04:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
there on the left lists the pollutants
 
04:28:38.109 --> 04:28:38.119 align:start position:0%
we monitor for we don't monitor for
 
04:28:40.229 --> 04:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
every pollutant at every station we just
 
04:28:42.149 --> 04:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
don't have that capability nor the
 
04:28:44.429 --> 04:28:44.439 align:start position:0%
resources to do that so we're very
 
04:28:46.550 --> 04:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
strategic and we work with EPA on an
 
04:28:48.750 --> 04:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
annual basis and on a 5-year review
 
04:28:51.189 --> 04:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
cycle uh to talk about what we're going
 
04:28:52.830 --> 04:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
to monitor for and where we're going to
 
04:28:55.149 --> 04:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
monitor for
 
04:28:55.159 --> 04:28:57.950 align:start position:0%
monitor for
so

04:28:57.950 --> 04:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:29:01.349 --> 04:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
y yes go ahead thanks would it be
 
04:29:04.189 --> 04:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
possible for you to just provide us or
 
04:29:07.149 --> 04:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
have maybe give us reference later to a
 
04:29:08.590 --> 04:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
matrix of
 
04:29:12.790 --> 04:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
the stations yep we have and which
 
04:29:14.830 --> 04:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
station monitor do they monitor you know
 
04:29:16.269 --> 04:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
on the Sea Coast do we monitor for
 
04:29:18.550 --> 04:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
everything do we monitor for two we have
 
04:29:20.309 --> 04:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
a chart that we can make available which
 
04:29:22.070 --> 04:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
identify each site and what pollutant is
 
04:29:24.309 --> 04:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
monitored for at that site and Mike's
 
04:29:27.429 --> 04:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:30.590 --> 04:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
note representative Corman yeah just
 
04:29:32.429 --> 04:29:32.439 align:start position:0%
looking at the map I mean I see uh
 
04:29:34.189 --> 04:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
stations in Portsmith and Ry which are
 
04:29:36.070 --> 04:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
awfully close together and then nothing
 
04:29:38.910 --> 04:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
north of Mount Washington so couple
 
04:29:41.109 --> 04:29:41.119 align:start position:0%
great points you can read a map very
 
04:29:44.550 --> 04:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
well so Portsmith and Ry uh we monitor
 
04:29:47.030 --> 04:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
ozone at both of those sites and and we
 
04:29:49.109 --> 04:29:49.119 align:start position:0%
purposely put two monitors relatively
 
04:29:51.950 --> 04:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
close together there for ozone because
 
04:29:55.070 --> 04:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
ozone has a very unique interaction with
 
04:29:58.830 --> 04:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
a where there's a water land interface
 
04:30:01.710 --> 04:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
and seab breezes and on offshore breezes
 
04:30:04.030 --> 04:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
and all that stuff so it's very
 
04:30:06.189 --> 04:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
scientific that we we will often pick up
 
04:30:07.590 --> 04:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
something in Rye but not see it in
 
04:30:09.149 --> 04:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
psmith and they're only separated by
 
04:30:11.269 --> 04:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
less than a mile so we did that
 
04:30:11.279 --> 04:30:12.590 align:start position:0%
less than a mile so we did that
purposefully

04:30:12.590 --> 04:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
purposefully
 
04:30:14.229 --> 04:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
uh with respect to Northern New
 
04:30:16.309 --> 04:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um actually last Summer's
 
04:30:18.630 --> 04:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
wildfires made it very abundantly clear
 
04:30:20.910 --> 04:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
to us that one thing we don't have in
 
04:30:23.189 --> 04:30:23.199 align:start position:0%
the North country is a fine particulate
 
04:30:24.830 --> 04:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
monitor which would be an indicator of
 
04:30:27.229 --> 04:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
wood smoke so we are actually just
 
04:30:29.670 --> 04:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
recently got a a grant from EPA that we
 
04:30:32.469 --> 04:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
intend to put a new PM monitor up north
 
04:30:34.229 --> 04:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
whether we include ozone or anything
 
04:30:35.710 --> 04:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
else like that we don't know yet at this
 
04:30:38.429 --> 04:30:38.439 align:start position:0%
point so we did put a temporary monitor
 
04:30:40.910 --> 04:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
up last year as well
 
04:30:40.920 --> 04:30:42.990 align:start position:0%
up last year as well
yeah

04:30:42.990 --> 04:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:30:46.030 --> 04:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
Henry thank you Mr chairman uh it used
 
04:30:47.229 --> 04:30:47.239 align:start position:0%
to be when the mill was running in
 
04:30:48.910 --> 04:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
Berlin you you would get readings from
 
04:30:50.950 --> 04:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
the mill correct do that with other
 
04:30:54.189 --> 04:30:54.199 align:start position:0%
locations other Mill locations um
 
04:30:56.070 --> 04:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
project anything else in the North
 
04:30:58.429 --> 04:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
Country the we we definitely used to
 
04:31:00.309 --> 04:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
have several monitors up in the Berlin
 
04:31:03.030 --> 04:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
area I think sulfur dioxide was one and
 
04:31:06.070 --> 04:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
carbon monoxide was another um they were
 
04:31:07.830 --> 04:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
specifically there to monitor air
 
04:31:09.469 --> 04:31:09.479 align:start position:0%
quality related to air emissions from
 
04:31:12.469 --> 04:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
the mill um probably the only only other
 
04:31:14.269 --> 04:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
site we have in the state that's
 
04:31:16.469 --> 04:31:16.479 align:start position:0%
specifically located for the probably
 
04:31:19.149 --> 04:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
the purposes of monitoring a source
 
04:31:20.950 --> 04:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
would be the PM Brook site which is
 
04:31:24.070 --> 04:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
downwind of marac station and we monitor
 
04:31:26.189 --> 04:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
for SO2 there which is the primary
 
04:31:29.149 --> 04:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
pollutant of concern coming out of
 
04:31:31.469 --> 04:31:31.479 align:start position:0%
marac and the next slide these are just
 
04:31:33.269 --> 04:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
some pictures of our monitoring sites
 
04:31:35.750 --> 04:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
these are all stick figures uh kind of
 
04:31:37.790 --> 04:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
you you know these are probably 8 by1
 
04:31:41.349 --> 04:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
sheds um they all probably contain you
 
04:31:43.189 --> 04:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
know hundreds of thousands of dollars of
 
04:31:45.429 --> 04:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
air monitoring equipment um we have
 
04:31:47.309 --> 04:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
field technicians that visit them on a
 
04:31:49.469 --> 04:31:49.479 align:start position:0%
regular basis one of the things we've
 
04:31:51.830 --> 04:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
really invested in late in the last five
 
04:31:54.189 --> 04:31:54.199 align:start position:0%
to 10 years is because we don't get more
 
04:31:56.349 --> 04:31:56.359 align:start position:0%
Federal money we need to streamline
 
04:31:58.469 --> 04:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
operations so a lot of this stuff is now
 
04:32:01.389 --> 04:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
automated so it requires less you know
 
04:32:03.429 --> 04:32:03.439 align:start position:0%
visits from a technician but we still do
 
04:32:05.790 --> 04:32:05.800 align:start position:0%
need to go out there and actually all of
 
04:32:08.030 --> 04:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
our air quality monitoring data from all
 
04:32:10.870 --> 04:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
of these sites is on the dees website
 
04:32:13.109 --> 04:32:13.119 align:start position:0%
and it's only an hour old so you can get
 
04:32:14.990 --> 04:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
an update every hour as to what the air
 
04:32:16.469 --> 04:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
quality is across the state of New
 
04:32:16.479 --> 04:32:17.710 align:start position:0%
quality is across the state of New
Hampshire

04:32:17.710 --> 04:32:17.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:32:20.389 --> 04:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
so the uh Miller State Park is a great
 
04:32:21.910 --> 04:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
one to visit if you're interested that's
 
04:32:24.710 --> 04:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
at the top of Pacman adock um and uh
 
04:32:26.830 --> 04:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
it's a great hike and well worth the
 
04:32:28.910 --> 04:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
visit but also I just a note that we
 
04:32:30.189 --> 04:32:30.199 align:start position:0%
have one of these stations in our
 
04:32:32.429 --> 04:32:32.439 align:start position:0%
parking lot at Hazen drive if anyone
 
04:32:34.030 --> 04:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to come over and take a look and
 
04:32:36.309 --> 04:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
see see how we operate what we do there
 
04:32:38.149 --> 04:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to show you we'd also be
 
04:32:40.510 --> 04:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
happy to have you accompany us to Miller
 
04:32:43.910 --> 04:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:46.189 --> 04:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
Washington so uh mentioned these are
 
04:32:49.189 --> 04:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
like 8x1 10 x 12 structures uh we're
 
04:32:51.550 --> 04:32:51.560 align:start position:0%
currently putting a new monitor in lonia
 
04:32:54.070 --> 04:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
using some real Advanced Micro shelter
 
04:32:56.070 --> 04:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
techniques so we're going from a
 
04:32:58.630 --> 04:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
footprint of 80 to 100 square foot site
 
04:33:01.269 --> 04:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
to probably something that's 3 by three
 
04:33:03.469 --> 04:33:03.479 align:start position:0%
and a half so it's a much smaller
 
04:33:05.590 --> 04:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
footprint monitoring site which we think
 
04:33:07.189 --> 04:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
is going to save us a lot of money on an
 
04:33:09.109 --> 04:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
operational standpoint because think of
 
04:33:11.230 --> 04:33:11.240 align:start position:0%
the heating and cooling loads on these
 
04:33:13.109 --> 04:33:13.119 align:start position:0%
structures it's a much smaller footprint
 
04:33:15.709 --> 04:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
so we're excited to be working on that
 
04:33:16.990 --> 04:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
i' also just mentioned the site in
 
04:33:18.750 --> 04:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
London area that you see there is what's
 
04:33:21.910 --> 04:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
called an incor site um it's a it's a
 
04:33:24.070 --> 04:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
very highly technical site and it's also
 
04:33:26.029 --> 04:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
an educational site for us it's located
 
04:33:29.349 --> 04:33:29.359 align:start position:0%
at us the musil school in londondary and
 
04:33:32.551 --> 04:33:32.561 align:start position:0%
uh you know uh we we have educational
 
04:33:35.349 --> 04:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
information for students and so on there
 
04:33:39.189 --> 04:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
um and uh we we are one of just a few
 
04:33:40.830 --> 04:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
states that have two of these endc cor
 
04:33:42.269 --> 04:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
sites we have
 
04:33:44.349 --> 04:33:44.359 align:start position:0%
uh the one at Miller and and the one in
 
04:33:46.590 --> 04:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
London Derry and U they they provide us
 
04:33:48.109 --> 04:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
with a significant amount of good
 
04:33:51.789 --> 04:33:51.799 align:start position:0%
science as well as um air monitoring so
 
04:33:53.429 --> 04:33:53.439 align:start position:0%
uh if you're in the vicinity it's well
 
04:33:57.070 --> 04:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
worth uh taking a taking a stop
 
04:33:59.590 --> 04:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
by all right so the next slide just
 
04:34:01.269 --> 04:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
talks about General air quality issues
 
04:34:03.510 --> 04:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh historically ozone
 
04:34:04.910 --> 04:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
in the summer has been our largest
 
04:34:07.869 --> 04:34:07.879 align:start position:0%
regulatory driver um we again we're
 
04:34:09.910 --> 04:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
currently a tment for we still have
 
04:34:12.470 --> 04:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
probably a handful of days every year
 
04:34:14.750 --> 04:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
where we exceed the ozone standard uh at
 
04:34:16.510 --> 04:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
least in the Sea Coast Area sometimes
 
04:34:19.910 --> 04:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
across the state um find particular
 
04:34:21.670 --> 04:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
matter traditionally that's been more of
 
04:34:24.310 --> 04:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
a wintertime pollutant uh a lot of it
 
04:34:27.150 --> 04:34:27.160 align:start position:0%
related to uh localized wood burning uh
 
04:34:29.310 --> 04:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
during the winter months heating season
 
04:34:31.470 --> 04:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
I always say wood is good so don't don't
 
04:34:33.990 --> 04:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
get me wrong by saying singling out wood
 
04:34:37.150 --> 04:34:37.160 align:start position:0%
here I I do believe in burning wood um
 
04:34:38.629 --> 04:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
just need to burn the right wood and the
 
04:34:42.949 --> 04:34:42.959 align:start position:0%
right device so um you to be like I said
 
04:34:44.910 --> 04:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
a wintertime thing we have noticed the
 
04:34:46.429 --> 04:34:46.439 align:start position:0%
last couple years more and more
 
04:34:49.429 --> 04:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
incidents of Canadian wildfires I just
 
04:34:53.109 --> 04:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
read an article this week uh that um
 
04:34:55.070 --> 04:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
there's still hundreds of fires burning
 
04:34:57.269 --> 04:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
underground in Canada they coined the
 
04:34:59.551 --> 04:34:59.561 align:start position:0%
term zombie fires so we're we're
 
04:34:59.561 --> 04:35:00.670 align:start position:0%
term zombie fires so we're we're
watching

04:35:00.670 --> 04:35:00.680 align:start position:0%
watching
 
04:35:04.349 --> 04:35:04.359 align:start position:0%
that Yep they're expecting uh another
 
04:35:06.551 --> 04:35:06.561 align:start position:0%
dry winter across Northern Canada so we
 
04:35:09.470 --> 04:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
are expecting uh wood smoke issues again
 
04:35:11.869 --> 04:35:11.879 align:start position:0%
potentially in New Hampshire last last
 
04:35:13.990 --> 04:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
year was at levels that we had never
 
04:35:16.150 --> 04:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
seen we didn't quite get it here in New
 
04:35:18.189 --> 04:35:18.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but we all saw pictures of
 
04:35:20.150 --> 04:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
what was going on in New York City and
 
04:35:22.230 --> 04:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania those were levels of air
 
04:35:23.629 --> 04:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
pollution that we've never dealt with
 
04:35:25.551 --> 04:35:25.561 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire I mean there's six
 
04:35:28.230 --> 04:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
levels on our scale typically we get to
 
04:35:30.269 --> 04:35:30.279 align:start position:0%
level three or four but we don't usually
 
04:35:32.709 --> 04:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
get to five or six so last summer we
 
04:35:34.310 --> 04:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
spent time working with Department of
 
04:35:36.390 --> 04:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services to come up with
 
04:35:38.830 --> 04:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
an action plan if we were to see those
 
04:35:41.109 --> 04:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
extremely high levels and we plan on
 
04:35:43.310 --> 04:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
dusting that plan off this year again in
 
04:35:45.349 --> 04:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
preparation for the season coming
 
04:35:47.789 --> 04:35:47.799 align:start position:0%
up uh Regional Haze I'm just going to
 
04:35:50.429 --> 04:35:50.439 align:start position:0%
quickly mention uh we have to reach New
 
04:35:52.150 --> 04:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has two class one areas those
 
04:35:53.670 --> 04:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
are special areas under the Clean Air
 
04:35:55.949 --> 04:35:55.959 align:start position:0%
Act they receive special protections and
 
04:35:58.230 --> 04:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
one of them is visibility uh we have to
 
04:36:00.029 --> 04:36:00.039 align:start position:0%
reach what they call Natural background
 
04:36:01.349 --> 04:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
conditions by
 
04:36:03.990 --> 04:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
2064 so I'm pretty sure I'll be long
 
04:36:05.990 --> 04:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
gone by then so I'm going to leave that
 
04:36:09.070 --> 04:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
to the to the stat now just kidding we
 
04:36:10.789 --> 04:36:10.799 align:start position:0%
are currently in our second planning
 
04:36:12.629 --> 04:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
period uh for regional Haze we've
 
04:36:14.230 --> 04:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
actually made good progress as a state
 
04:36:16.390 --> 04:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
in the region in improving Regional uh
 
04:36:18.551 --> 04:36:18.561 align:start position:0%
Haze and visibility in the class one
 
04:36:20.070 --> 04:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
areas it's kind of flattened out the
 
04:36:22.750 --> 04:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
last year or so so we're monitoring that
 
04:36:24.510 --> 04:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
and we'll continue to to make
 
04:36:27.070 --> 04:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
strides from a very high level people
 
04:36:28.709 --> 04:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
ask how is the air quality in New
 
04:36:30.510 --> 04:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think this this table here
 
04:36:32.349 --> 04:36:32.359 align:start position:0%
summarizes about as good as you can do
 
04:36:34.510 --> 04:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
this is all of our counties and our high
 
04:36:36.390 --> 04:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
elevation sites on the far right high
 
04:36:39.150 --> 04:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
elevation being uh Mount Washington and
 
04:36:41.709 --> 04:36:41.719 align:start position:0%
Pacman adok green represents good
 
04:36:43.429 --> 04:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
qualities in good air quality in the
 
04:36:45.629 --> 04:36:45.639 align:start position:0%
state and you can see most days we're
 
04:36:48.029 --> 04:36:48.039 align:start position:0%
generally uh 80 to 90% of the time we're
 
04:36:50.869 --> 04:36:50.879 align:start position:0%
good air quality 10% of the time we're
 
04:36:52.750 --> 04:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
moderate air quality and then a handful
 
04:36:54.789 --> 04:36:54.799 align:start position:0%
of times we get to that unhealthy for
 
04:36:56.910 --> 04:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
sensitive groups and that's when we're
 
04:37:02.150 --> 04:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:04.390 --> 04:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
standards this is another nice chart
 
04:37:07.029 --> 04:37:07.039 align:start position:0%
that shows ozone Trends in New Hampshire
 
04:37:08.949 --> 04:37:08.959 align:start position:0%
uh the red line here is really something
 
04:37:10.349 --> 04:37:10.359 align:start position:0%
that I want to point out we mentioned
 
04:37:12.949 --> 04:37:12.959 align:start position:0%
that EPA does the periodic review of the
 
04:37:15.949 --> 04:37:15.959 align:start position:0%
standards and that red line represents
 
04:37:18.429 --> 04:37:18.439 align:start position:0%
how EPA has revised the standard over
 
04:37:20.910 --> 04:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
time um as you can see it always goes
 
04:37:23.670 --> 04:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
down it never goes up um but if you also
 
04:37:25.510 --> 04:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
look at the data uh we've seen
 
04:37:27.470 --> 04:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
tremendous emission reductions across
 
04:37:29.029 --> 04:37:29.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and across the country as
 
04:37:31.269 --> 04:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
a whole um under the Clean Air Act and
 
04:37:33.429 --> 04:37:33.439 align:start position:0%
state statutes um and as you can see as
 
04:37:35.750 --> 04:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
a result of that our air quality has
 
04:37:37.269 --> 04:37:37.279 align:start position:0%
improved and that's the black line it
 
04:37:39.510 --> 04:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
shows how you can see there were periods
 
04:37:40.869 --> 04:37:40.879 align:start position:0%
in the past where we're above those
 
04:37:42.670 --> 04:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
standards but now we're below all those
 
04:37:44.109 --> 04:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
standards so that that's a good
 
04:37:46.029 --> 04:37:46.039 align:start position:0%
long-term Trend and that's one we want
 
04:37:48.869 --> 04:37:48.879 align:start position:0%
to continue cuz I suspect this standard
 
04:37:52.310 --> 04:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
will get more stringent in the future
 
04:37:55.269 --> 04:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
yes uh what's the main source of ground
 
04:37:58.590 --> 04:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
level ozone so ozone is a
 
04:38:02.230 --> 04:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
soup it's a chemical reaction that is
 
04:38:06.551 --> 04:38:06.561 align:start position:0%
combines um oxygen nitrogen
 
04:38:09.750 --> 04:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
B it it comes it comes primarily well
 
04:38:11.150 --> 04:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
there's naturally occurring ozone of
 
04:38:12.869 --> 04:38:12.879 align:start position:0%
course both in the upper atmosphere and
 
04:38:15.150 --> 04:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
lower atmosphere but in terms of
 
04:38:17.629 --> 04:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
man-made ozone It's a combination of
 
04:38:20.269 --> 04:38:20.279 align:start position:0%
emissions of nitrogen oxides volto
 
04:38:22.709 --> 04:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
organic compounds and the presence of
 
04:38:26.910 --> 04:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
sunlight and it's a it's a chemical
 
04:38:30.230 --> 04:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
reaction oh it's it's primarily from
 
04:38:32.750 --> 04:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
caruse regulated Smoke Stack Industries
 
04:38:35.830 --> 04:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's from us burning fuel at home
 
04:38:38.670 --> 04:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
it's from Transportation it's from power
 
04:38:42.029 --> 04:38:42.039 align:start position:0%
plants it's from coating operations
 
04:38:44.789 --> 04:38:44.799 align:start position:0%
so coding
 
04:38:47.670 --> 04:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
yep the issue with ozone is that a lot
 
04:38:50.189 --> 04:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
of the pollutants that form ozone are
 
04:38:53.109 --> 04:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
transported um and they come up the 95
 
04:38:56.551 --> 04:38:56.561 align:start position:0%
Corridor the mobile Source portion of it
 
04:38:58.830 --> 04:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
but also that's the prevailing wind
 
04:39:00.310 --> 04:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
pattern that you know if you look if you
 
04:39:01.510 --> 04:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
want to know what our weather is look
 
04:39:04.910 --> 04:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
out in the midwest a couple days ago so
 
04:39:07.349 --> 04:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
we get emissions from power plants in
 
04:39:09.189 --> 04:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
the midwest that come come this way
 
04:39:11.189 --> 04:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
combine and then and then when they come
 
04:39:12.670 --> 04:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
in to New Hampshire they mix with our
 
04:39:14.551 --> 04:39:14.561 align:start position:0%
emissions and then the sunlight so the
 
04:39:17.310 --> 04:39:17.320 align:start position:0%
ozone can actually form here but the
 
04:39:19.429 --> 04:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
pollutants that create it are
 
04:39:21.390 --> 04:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
transported in and sometimes it's
 
04:39:23.429 --> 04:39:23.439 align:start position:0%
created elsewhere and transported in
 
04:39:24.869 --> 04:39:24.879 align:start position:0%
that's and that's the issue we see at
 
04:39:28.990 --> 04:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
Rye also with the uh uh onshore breezes
 
04:39:30.750 --> 04:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
ozone goes out over the ocean and then
 
04:39:33.551 --> 04:39:33.561 align:start position:0%
comes back in representative Noel did
 
04:39:35.910 --> 04:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
04:39:38.430 --> 04:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
question oh
 
04:39:42.070 --> 04:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh okay uh just quickly
 
04:39:44.948 --> 04:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
our air pering program um in New
 
04:39:47.030 --> 04:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're a fully delegated State
 
04:39:49.550 --> 04:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh EPA has approved our state's Minos
 
04:39:51.670 --> 04:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
Source permitting program and also
 
04:39:53.590 --> 04:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
they've delegated as authority of the
 
04:39:55.510 --> 04:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
federal Title 5 permit program which is
 
04:39:59.310 --> 04:39:59.320 align:start position:0%
for major sources um we like to we again
 
04:40:00.510 --> 04:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
we think that's a good thing for New
 
04:40:02.230 --> 04:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Industries uh if you need an
 
04:40:04.230 --> 04:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
air permit whether it's a state or a
 
04:40:06.030 --> 04:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
federal ebased permit you come to New
 
04:40:08.788 --> 04:40:08.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees there is a role for EPA
 
04:40:09.990 --> 04:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
and I think one of the other slides
 
04:40:13.350 --> 04:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
talks about that overall we have about
 
04:40:15.708 --> 04:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
uh I think six or 700 sources that have
 
04:40:18.070 --> 04:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
air permits in New Hampshire we receive
 
04:40:22.270 --> 04:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
about 120 applications a year um we have
 
04:40:25.110 --> 04:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
400 or so sources permited we have a
 
04:40:27.510 --> 04:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
what we call a general State permit um
 
04:40:28.868 --> 04:40:28.878 align:start position:0%
this is something we'd like to actually
 
04:40:30.670 --> 04:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
expand our ability to do where we
 
04:40:32.868 --> 04:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
establish a single permit and sources
 
04:40:35.350 --> 04:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
can register under that General permit
 
04:40:38.030 --> 04:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
rather than um get a site specific
 
04:40:40.550 --> 04:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
permit and that is a uh fully online
 
04:40:44.550 --> 04:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:47.430 --> 04:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
that again New Hampshire Dees is where
 
04:40:49.470 --> 04:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
the lead on the federal Title 5 permit
 
04:40:51.830 --> 04:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
program there is a role for EPA EPA has
 
04:40:54.550 --> 04:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
the ability to review comment on draft
 
04:40:57.590 --> 04:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
decisions authority to object to a a
 
04:41:00.190 --> 04:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
permit as far as I can recall since
 
04:41:03.230 --> 04:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
we've had this program a 1993 EPA has
 
04:41:05.470 --> 04:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
never formally objected to all of any of
 
04:41:08.310 --> 04:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
our permits um there was a couple issues
 
04:41:10.470 --> 04:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
a number of years ago on One Source but
 
04:41:12.110 --> 04:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
we dealt with that
 
04:41:14.270 --> 04:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh EPA audits our Title Five permit
 
04:41:17.030 --> 04:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
program every five years um my
 
04:41:18.470 --> 04:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
understanding from Reading their audit
 
04:41:20.628 --> 04:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
the last go go around is that we got a
 
04:41:22.830 --> 04:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
very clean bill of health from EPA in
 
04:41:24.750 --> 04:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
terms of how we run our titley permit
 
04:41:26.430 --> 04:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
program and then the only other thing
 
04:41:28.470 --> 04:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
I'll say about permits in general is any
 
04:41:30.230 --> 04:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
decision we make can be appealed to the
 
04:41:32.788 --> 04:41:32.798 align:start position:0%
a Resources Council it's a separate
 
04:41:35.390 --> 04:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
oversight board uh established under
 
04:41:40.150 --> 04:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
separate RSA and if if either uh a party
 
04:41:41.750 --> 04:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
a private party or the the company is
 
04:41:44.030 --> 04:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
unhappy with a permit decision there's a
 
04:41:45.830 --> 04:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
process they can follow to appeal to the
 
04:41:48.628 --> 04:41:48.638 align:start position:0%
air Resources Council representative
 
04:41:51.990 --> 04:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question thank you um just
 
04:41:54.550 --> 04:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
with regard to air permits did the EPA
 
04:41:56.868 --> 04:41:56.878 align:start position:0%
review the most recent air permit for S
 
04:41:59.750 --> 04:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
go Bay and marac we send all of our
 
04:42:03.788 --> 04:42:03.798 align:start position:0%
permits to EPA um for state permits like
 
04:42:07.110 --> 04:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
St gobain they don't have a formal role
 
04:42:08.708 --> 04:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
uh like the title fire permit program
 
04:42:11.270 --> 04:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
there's definitely a formal role for EPA
 
04:42:12.948 --> 04:42:12.958 align:start position:0%
uh we send all of our permits to them
 
04:42:15.708 --> 04:42:15.718 align:start position:0%
whether they choose to comment on a
 
04:42:17.868 --> 04:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
state only permit uh you know that's
 
04:42:19.150 --> 04:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
obviously up to
 
04:42:21.788 --> 04:42:21.798 align:start position:0%
them but yes it was sent to
 
04:42:24.590 --> 04:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
them I don't believe they
 
04:42:26.550 --> 04:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
commented I just wanted to mention with
 
04:42:28.708 --> 04:42:28.718 align:start position:0%
regards to permits also this year we
 
04:42:30.510 --> 04:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
have uh requested one piece of
 
04:42:32.270 --> 04:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
legislation which is started over in the
 
04:42:32.280 --> 04:42:33.550 align:start position:0%
legislation which is started over in the
Senate

04:42:33.550 --> 04:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
04:42:36.550 --> 04:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
s449 that adjusts some timelines for us
 
04:42:41.310 --> 04:42:41.320 align:start position:0%
to correct um uh and allow us to be uh
 
04:42:43.070 --> 04:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh comport with with the federal
 
04:42:46.270 --> 04:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
requirements and and um that did pass
 
04:42:48.230 --> 04:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
out of the senate committee last week
 
04:42:50.510 --> 04:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
and it'll hope I assume it'll be coming
 
04:42:52.510 --> 04:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
to this committee uh sometime in the
 
04:42:55.590 --> 04:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
next few weeks um and we' certainly it's
 
04:42:58.868 --> 04:42:58.878 align:start position:0%
a request of Dees and uh it's it's to
 
04:43:00.670 --> 04:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
allow us to have the appropriate
 
04:43:04.030 --> 04:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
timelines um and it's really it's really
 
04:43:06.150 --> 04:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh I won't say a recordkeeping but it's
 
04:43:08.510 --> 04:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
it's very much a housekeeping type of
 
04:43:11.150 --> 04:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
thing that we need to straighten out
 
04:43:13.310 --> 04:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
hope you're uh we'll give it some
 
04:43:15.708 --> 04:43:15.718 align:start position:0%
consideration when it comes
 
04:43:18.628 --> 04:43:18.638 align:start position:0%
across uh what we we can jump to the
 
04:43:20.350 --> 04:43:20.360 align:start position:0%
next slide I
 
04:43:23.190 --> 04:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
think so just our compliance Bureau
 
04:43:24.550 --> 04:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
these are the boots on the ground these
 
04:43:25.868 --> 04:43:25.878 align:start position:0%
are the folks out in the field
 
04:43:28.990 --> 04:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
inspecting sources um these are the the
 
04:43:30.910 --> 04:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
folks that are out in the field when
 
04:43:32.708 --> 04:43:32.718 align:start position:0%
there is an emissions test required in
 
04:43:35.110 --> 04:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire out of a smoke stack uh
 
04:43:37.190 --> 04:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
our policy is to be on site to oversee
 
04:43:38.550 --> 04:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
the stack testing we don't do the
 
04:43:41.230 --> 04:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
testing but we review the protocols for
 
04:43:43.110 --> 04:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
the test we're on site to oversee the
 
04:43:44.910 --> 04:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
testing to make sure it's done in
 
04:43:46.390 --> 04:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
accordance with Federal testing
 
04:43:48.590 --> 04:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
requirements and we review the final
 
04:43:50.270 --> 04:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
reports as well so we think that's an
 
04:43:52.670 --> 04:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
important part of that program um we
 
04:43:54.830 --> 04:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
probably are out there 80 to 100 tests a
 
04:43:59.150 --> 04:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
year um complaints we get about 70 to 80
 
04:44:00.750 --> 04:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
we try to investigate every single
 
04:44:02.910 --> 04:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
complaint on some level sometimes it's a
 
04:44:05.788 --> 04:44:05.798 align:start position:0%
phone call to this to a situation to
 
04:44:06.990 --> 04:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
understand it better sometimes it's
 
04:44:08.788 --> 04:44:08.798 align:start position:0%
where we send an inspector out to see
 
04:44:11.430 --> 04:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
what's going on out there our esus
 
04:44:13.550 --> 04:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
Management program uh I mentioned that
 
04:44:15.510 --> 04:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
we do two things we do the asbest in
 
04:44:17.990 --> 04:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
school the aara program we do 30 to 40
 
04:44:20.708 --> 04:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
inspections a year um at schools that
 
04:44:22.190 --> 04:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
contain as bestus to make sure they're
 
04:44:23.910 --> 04:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
complying with the federal or heer
 
04:44:26.350 --> 04:44:26.360 align:start position:0%
requirements and we also oversee we get
 
04:44:28.150 --> 04:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,200
 
04:44:30.070 --> 04:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
notifications a year for demolition
 
04:44:32.070 --> 04:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
renovation projects where there's aestus
 
04:44:34.590 --> 04:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
being removed uh we get out and probably
 
04:44:37.670 --> 04:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
inspect 10 to 15% of those I I wish
 
04:44:39.470 --> 04:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
somebody would say can you do more but
 
04:44:41.310 --> 04:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
that's what we have the resources to do
 
04:44:44.948 --> 04:44:44.958 align:start position:0%
so um what else we got uh enforcement
 
04:44:46.788 --> 04:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
actions not our first choice obviously
 
04:44:48.190 --> 04:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
we want to work with industry to make
 
04:44:50.150 --> 04:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
sure they're in compliance uh but we
 
04:44:51.708 --> 04:44:51.718 align:start position:0%
have a number of tools in terms of
 
04:44:53.910 --> 04:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement in ter including the ability
 
04:44:58.190 --> 04:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
to issue letters of deficiencies uh uh
 
04:45:00.310 --> 04:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
put on administrative fines or refer
 
04:45:01.830 --> 04:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
things to the Attorney General's office
 
04:45:04.110 --> 04:45:04.120 align:start position:0%
for civil penalties our goal with
 
04:45:05.708 --> 04:45:05.718 align:start position:0%
respect to enforcement is to have a
 
04:45:07.390 --> 04:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
source get into compliance first and
 
04:45:08.990 --> 04:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
foremost and then deal with the
 
04:45:11.550 --> 04:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
non-compliance issue after that and then
 
04:45:14.110 --> 04:45:14.120 align:start position:0%
our other goal is to handle all cases
 
04:45:16.390 --> 04:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
right here in New Hampshire and have EPA
 
04:45:19.430 --> 04:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
not over file on any enforcement actions
 
04:45:22.430 --> 04:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
and I am not aware of EPA over filing in
 
04:45:25.030 --> 04:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
any any recent action we've taken you
 
04:45:27.230 --> 04:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
have an idea of roughly how many per
 
04:45:29.350 --> 04:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
year enforcement actions it really
 
04:45:31.670 --> 04:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
varies year toe we actually put together
 
04:45:34.070 --> 04:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
an annual report on our enforcement
 
04:45:36.510 --> 04:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
actions it can be anywhere from 20 a
 
04:45:39.550 --> 04:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
year to 100 so we could certainly make
 
04:45:41.310 --> 04:45:41.320 align:start position:0%
that report available to the committee
 
04:45:42.868 --> 04:45:42.878 align:start position:0%
if you'd
 
04:45:45.910 --> 04:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
like there's also a very wide variety of
 
04:45:48.310 --> 04:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions be some things can
 
04:45:50.230 --> 04:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
be very minor recordkeeping issues and
 
04:45:52.830 --> 04:45:52.840 align:start position:0%
others are so num actual numbers of
 
04:45:55.708 --> 04:45:55.718 align:start position:0%
actions doesn't correlate to
 
04:45:58.150 --> 04:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
severity representative
 
04:46:00.390 --> 04:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
bernardy thank you Mr chair uh just
 
04:46:02.948 --> 04:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
going back to asbest you say around
 
04:46:07.670 --> 04:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
1,200 a year is that trending down as as
 
04:46:09.590 --> 04:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully we're getting rid of it most
 
04:46:11.708 --> 04:46:11.718 align:start position:0%
of it in the state you know that's what
 
04:46:13.868 --> 04:46:13.878 align:start position:0%
we expect but we just haven't seen that
 
04:46:16.788 --> 04:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
yet um there's a lot of Redevelopment
 
04:46:18.628 --> 04:46:18.638 align:start position:0%
going on in New Hampshire a lot of old
 
04:46:20.628 --> 04:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
buildings Old Mill buildings a lot of
 
04:46:23.270 --> 04:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
old structures and a lot of that work's
 
04:46:24.868 --> 04:46:24.878 align:start position:0%
being done you would think eventually it
 
04:46:26.628 --> 04:46:26.638 align:start position:0%
would work its way out yeah you would
 
04:46:29.190 --> 04:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
think so but long-term trends we're not
 
04:46:32.350 --> 04:46:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:35.670 --> 04:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
yet representative Noel thank you Mr
 
04:46:38.390 --> 04:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
chairman uh in general with regards to
 
04:46:40.548 --> 04:46:40.558 align:start position:0%
the compliance and the Staffing that you
 
04:46:42.948 --> 04:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
have do you feel you're you're you're
 
04:46:45.830 --> 04:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
seeing the majority of the issues that
 
04:46:47.470 --> 04:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
are out there or do you feel that
 
04:46:49.190 --> 04:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
there's still a lot of things not being
 
04:46:52.270 --> 04:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
picked up in your compliance efforts I I
 
04:46:54.510 --> 04:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
I I think we run a very comprehensive
 
04:46:56.628 --> 04:46:56.638 align:start position:0%
program um especially with respect to
 
04:46:59.270 --> 04:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
our permanent sources we have a lot of
 
04:47:01.030 --> 04:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
regulatory oversight on permanent
 
04:47:04.510 --> 04:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
sources um either through a mandatory
 
04:47:06.830 --> 04:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
inspection schedule that EPA sets and we
 
04:47:10.270 --> 04:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
comply with um complaints were fairly
 
04:47:11.350 --> 04:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
good at
 
04:47:14.070 --> 04:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
um following up on um it's the things we
 
04:47:16.470 --> 04:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
don't know about that you know if
 
04:47:18.390 --> 04:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
somebody doesn't report it to us or if
 
04:47:22.150 --> 04:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
we don't see it or if we're not there um
 
04:47:24.110 --> 04:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
but I I would say generally in New
 
04:47:26.350 --> 04:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have a high level of
 
04:47:29.750 --> 04:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
compliance in our regulated
 
04:47:31.750 --> 04:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
Industries I'd also note that we're one
 
04:47:33.868 --> 04:47:33.878 align:start position:0%
of very few states that actually
 
04:47:37.310 --> 04:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
observes and uh overseas every stack
 
04:47:41.350 --> 04:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
test um very few States have uh have
 
04:47:41.360 --> 04:47:43.670 align:start position:0%
test um very few States have uh have
that

04:47:43.670 --> 04:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:45.750 --> 04:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
requirement I think Mike were you gonna
 
04:47:48.110 --> 04:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
pick it up from here
 
04:47:52.030 --> 04:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
okay you mean pick it up speed wise
 
04:47:54.910 --> 04:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
or well we've only gone a half
 
04:47:58.390 --> 04:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
hour but we can pick it up no um so
 
04:48:00.628 --> 04:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
again uh big mentioned one of our
 
04:48:02.470 --> 04:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
bureaus is our Technical Services Bureau
 
04:48:04.430 --> 04:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
that oversees the air monitoring program
 
04:48:07.150 --> 04:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
that we oh I'm sorry that oversees the
 
04:48:08.390 --> 04:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
air monitoring program that we've
 
04:48:10.990 --> 04:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
already talked about um we deal with mob
 
04:48:13.628 --> 04:48:13.638 align:start position:0%
sources uh again Vehicles vehicular
 
04:48:15.788 --> 04:48:15.798 align:start position:0%
traffic and so on that's a very tough
 
04:48:18.190 --> 04:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
tough nut to crack that's you know
 
04:48:20.190 --> 04:48:20.200 align:start position:0%
hitting people where they live and and
 
04:48:25.470 --> 04:48:25.480 align:start position:0%
drive so on and um um so uh we do have a
 
04:48:28.708 --> 04:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
role in Regional Transportation Planning
 
04:48:30.750 --> 04:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
um we do Implement along with the
 
04:48:32.628 --> 04:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety the federal Clean
 
04:48:34.470 --> 04:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
Air Act required vehicle inspection
 
04:48:36.830 --> 04:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance program um we have some
 
04:48:39.310 --> 04:48:39.320 align:start position:0%
voluntary programs uh we also receive
 
04:48:42.190 --> 04:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
federal funding under the the um diesel
 
04:48:44.190 --> 04:48:44.200 align:start position:0%
emission reduction act for replacing
 
04:48:47.350 --> 04:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
diesel uh older diesel vehicles with
 
04:48:50.750 --> 04:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
with newer engines and um and and also
 
04:48:53.030 --> 04:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
we oversee the Volkswagen settlement
 
04:48:58.070 --> 04:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
that um uh put $30 million into the
 
04:49:00.948 --> 04:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um we oversee the
 
04:49:03.270 --> 04:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
dispersement of those funds uh for
 
04:49:05.350 --> 04:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
replacement of engines and that that
 
04:49:08.750 --> 04:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
type of work um 15% of that can be used
 
04:49:11.590 --> 04:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
for implementing EV infrastructure
 
04:49:13.350 --> 04:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
and we've been we've been uh
 
04:49:16.190 --> 04:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
establishing uh some some new EV sites
 
04:49:19.430 --> 04:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire as well um
 
04:49:21.510 --> 04:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
we also have energy and climate programs
 
04:49:23.390 --> 04:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
we defer primarily to the Department of
 
04:49:27.070 --> 04:49:27.080 align:start position:0%
energy on energy issues um up until you
 
04:49:28.270 --> 04:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
know we didn't have a department of
 
04:49:30.270 --> 04:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
energy until a couple of years ago and a
 
04:49:32.948 --> 04:49:32.958 align:start position:0%
few years ago so um but now now that we
 
04:49:35.350 --> 04:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
do um on the energy side we defer to
 
04:49:38.510 --> 04:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
them primarily on the financial issues
 
04:49:41.670 --> 04:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
um on environmental issues we we will
 
04:49:44.270 --> 04:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
raise issues and make sure that there's
 
04:49:46.708 --> 04:49:46.718 align:start position:0%
um uh you know the environmental
 
04:49:49.030 --> 04:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
requirements are met um we also
 
04:49:50.590 --> 04:49:50.600 align:start position:0%
Implement I'll talk later about the
 
04:49:53.948 --> 04:49:53.958 align:start position:0%
regional greenhouse gas initiative um we
 
04:49:56.750 --> 04:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
were the agency that actually um brought
 
04:49:58.510 --> 04:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
the RPS to the state but again that's
 
04:50:00.750 --> 04:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
primarily run by Doe now because it
 
04:50:06.190 --> 04:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
really is an energy Market um and um uh
 
04:50:09.868 --> 04:50:09.878 align:start position:0%
esek is uh State uh state agencies the
 
04:50:12.430 --> 04:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
organization of state agencies that um
 
04:50:14.548 --> 04:50:14.558 align:start position:0%
we work together to reduce reduce energy
 
04:50:17.628 --> 04:50:17.638 align:start position:0%
usage and and lower costs for state
 
04:50:22.070 --> 04:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
agencies uh and um then uh we do uh to
 
04:50:25.510 --> 04:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
we work closely with both doe and pu um
 
04:50:29.270 --> 04:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
as environmental issues effect there was
 
04:50:31.628 --> 04:50:31.638 align:start position:0%
so again mobile sources um I've talked
 
04:50:35.430 --> 04:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
about yeah sorry can't do two things at
 
04:50:38.948 --> 04:50:38.958 align:start position:0%
once um I've talked about these uh these
 
04:50:42.190 --> 04:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
issues here so I think I'll
 
04:50:42.200 --> 04:50:48.430 align:start position:0%
issues here so I think I'll
um

04:50:48.430 --> 04:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:52.430 --> 04:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:57.110 --> 04:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
can't why can't keep my so yeah again uh
 
04:51:01.070 --> 04:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
Dr and VW we've talked about um we in
 
04:51:02.830 --> 04:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
the director's office we also have an
 
04:51:04.910 --> 04:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
atmospheric science and Analysis group
 
04:51:07.510 --> 04:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
that um does does our modeling work and
 
04:51:11.030 --> 04:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of them we we do model um St stary
 
04:51:13.548 --> 04:51:13.558 align:start position:0%
sources before they get a permit for
 
04:51:17.548 --> 04:51:17.558 align:start position:0%
toxics and and other other pollutants um
 
04:51:20.430 --> 04:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
we uh do maintain what's known as an
 
04:51:23.750 --> 04:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
emissions inventory we determine uh uh
 
04:51:25.270 --> 04:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
the total amount of pollutants that are
 
04:51:27.868 --> 04:51:27.878 align:start position:0%
emitted in New Hampshire we do estimates
 
04:51:30.868 --> 04:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
of of a lot of different pollutants uh
 
04:51:34.030 --> 04:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
and and maintain that inventory uh as
 
04:51:36.270 --> 04:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
Craig mentioned we participate in the
 
04:51:38.868 --> 04:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
OTC and Main view main view is um
 
04:51:40.910 --> 04:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
Mid-Atlantic Northeast visibility Union
 
04:51:42.470 --> 04:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's the regional Haze issue that
 
04:51:43.830 --> 04:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
Craig talked about that's the
 
04:51:46.310 --> 04:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
organization of states that that work on
 
04:51:48.788 --> 04:51:48.798 align:start position:0%
that because that Regional Haze again is
 
04:51:51.948 --> 04:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
transported up the uh up up the coast
 
04:51:56.070 --> 04:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
from a number of sources so um the uh
 
04:51:57.510 --> 04:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
Pam's monitoring is the highly
 
04:52:00.788 --> 04:52:00.798 align:start position:0%
sophisticated Inc Court uh sites that we
 
04:52:04.350 --> 04:52:04.360 align:start position:0%
uh we do um that's a highly scientific
 
04:52:07.190 --> 04:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh pams as a component of ozone and so
 
04:52:10.510 --> 04:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
uh we we measure that we are also put
 
04:52:12.628 --> 04:52:12.638 align:start position:0%
put out daily air pollution forecasts
 
04:52:15.110 --> 04:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
that the TV stations all pick up and and
 
04:52:19.310 --> 04:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
are in newspapers and so on um uh every
 
04:52:20.750 --> 04:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
especially on days where there's air
 
04:52:22.788 --> 04:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
quality impairment those few days that
 
04:52:25.628 --> 04:52:25.638 align:start position:0%
Craig mentioned in the other slide and
 
04:52:27.350 --> 04:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
we have the citizens air monitoring
 
04:52:29.070 --> 04:52:29.080 align:start position:0%
program which where citizens can
 
04:52:31.190 --> 04:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
actually buy their own little sensors
 
04:52:33.948 --> 04:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
and uh enroll them with us and and
 
04:52:36.868 --> 04:52:36.878 align:start position:0%
measure uh PM pollution so number of
 
04:52:38.948 --> 04:52:38.958 align:start position:0%
questions seem to be representative
 
04:52:42.190 --> 04:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair um with regard
 
04:52:44.470 --> 04:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
to the measuring of past compounds can
 
04:52:46.310 --> 04:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
you tell me how many compounds you
 
04:52:47.910 --> 04:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
you're looking for are they just the
 
04:52:49.470 --> 04:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
four that are
 
04:52:52.548 --> 04:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
regulated uh as far as regulatory
 
04:52:55.510 --> 04:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
monitoring yes we have done we've we've
 
04:52:57.470 --> 04:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
done some stack testing and we have a
 
04:53:01.150 --> 04:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
lot of data on other compounds but um
 
04:53:03.070 --> 04:53:03.080 align:start position:0%
from a regulatory standpoint the only
 
04:53:06.030 --> 04:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
thing that the statute uh uh gives us
 
04:53:07.990 --> 04:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
authority over is those four compounds
 
04:53:11.150 --> 04:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
that uh have impacted water uh in in the
 
04:53:14.750 --> 04:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
in the area but we do have we do collect
 
04:53:16.750 --> 04:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of data on numerous other
 
04:53:18.470 --> 04:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
compounds and have collected it over the
 
04:53:20.670 --> 04:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
years especially in regards to S our
 
04:53:22.390 --> 04:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
requirements with the SLE bean stack
 
04:53:26.110 --> 04:53:26.120 align:start position:0%
tests thank you representative
 
04:53:28.270 --> 04:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
Corman representative
 
04:53:31.548 --> 04:53:31.558 align:start position:0%
Noel thank you Mr chair uh in in the
 
04:53:33.788 --> 04:53:33.798 align:start position:0%
interest of General air quality does
 
04:53:36.470 --> 04:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
anybody in your department monitored for
 
04:53:41.910 --> 04:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
CO2 CO2 level uh uh no CO2 is a is a
 
04:53:44.628 --> 04:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
pollutant related to uh you know it's a
 
04:53:47.470 --> 04:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas obviously and so on um
 
04:53:50.310 --> 04:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
but it's it doesn't have direct uh
 
04:53:52.948 --> 04:53:52.958 align:start position:0%
impacts like the six pollutants that we
 
04:53:56.070 --> 04:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
we did and also CO2 uh is a very general
 
04:54:01.070 --> 04:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
pollutant um and so a measurement in a a
 
04:54:03.030 --> 04:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
specific area is really not overly
 
04:54:03.040 --> 04:54:04.310 align:start position:0%
specific area is really not overly
informative

04:54:04.310 --> 04:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
informative
 
04:54:07.230 --> 04:54:07.240 align:start position:0%
CO2 in the atmosphere tends to disperse
 
04:54:09.548 --> 04:54:09.558 align:start position:0%
and it has a pretty General level and
 
04:54:11.430 --> 04:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
it's that General in the atmosphere
 
04:54:14.670 --> 04:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a a problem and and
 
04:54:17.190 --> 04:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
creates the uh uh climate issues that
 
04:54:21.270 --> 04:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
were we address but we don't measure it
 
04:54:23.590 --> 04:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
directly I know there is one station in
 
04:54:25.270 --> 04:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
Hawaii and I might have to go
 
04:54:26.948 --> 04:54:26.958 align:start position:0%
investigate that
 
04:54:29.670 --> 04:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh some some point I think CO2 is
 
04:54:31.628 --> 04:54:31.638 align:start position:0%
uniform everywhere on Earth pretty
 
04:54:34.390 --> 04:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
pretty much yes yes there represent
 
04:54:36.628 --> 04:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
partial yes I assume you'd say the same
 
04:54:39.548 --> 04:54:39.558 align:start position:0%
thing if I asked about methane correct
 
04:54:42.190 --> 04:54:42.200 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah well uh the biggest methane
 
04:54:45.910 --> 04:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
issue is is oil and gas operations and
 
04:54:48.350 --> 04:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
Le leaking and EPA has done a lot of
 
04:54:49.628 --> 04:54:49.638 align:start position:0%
work over the last couple of years and
 
04:54:52.670 --> 04:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
so on we don't have a lot of of oil and
 
04:54:55.868 --> 04:54:55.878 align:start position:0%
gas pipelines um here in New Hampshire I
 
04:54:58.430 --> 04:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
mean there are other there there are
 
04:55:00.830 --> 04:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
different sources of methane but um
 
04:55:02.548 --> 04:55:02.558 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's the biggest issue
 
04:55:04.868 --> 04:55:04.878 align:start position:0%
and and but it's also a greenhouse gas
 
04:55:04.878 --> 04:55:08.670 align:start position:0%
and and but it's also a greenhouse gas
pollutant

04:55:08.670 --> 04:55:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:13.788 --> 04:55:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:16.110 --> 04:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
neither Craig or I understand this slide
 
04:55:18.868 --> 04:55:18.878 align:start position:0%
but no no this just kind of shows we we
 
04:55:20.628 --> 04:55:20.638 align:start position:0%
have a unit in in the director's office
 
04:55:23.270 --> 04:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
called the state implementation plan the
 
04:55:27.150 --> 04:55:27.160 align:start position:0%
uh unit sip for short um the way that
 
04:55:29.708 --> 04:55:29.718 align:start position:0%
EPA oversees us is by What's called the
 
04:55:31.390 --> 04:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
state implementation plan when there's
 
04:55:34.750 --> 04:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
an EPA requirement we we adopt that
 
04:55:37.868 --> 04:55:37.878 align:start position:0%
requirement we put it into our Sip and
 
04:55:40.310 --> 04:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
so this just shows that that sip unit
 
04:55:43.110 --> 04:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
net Works to marry Federal requirements
 
04:55:46.788 --> 04:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
the state requirements and um a num
 
04:55:50.670 --> 04:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
numerous others uh to they those those
 
04:55:53.708 --> 04:55:53.718 align:start position:0%
go into our Sip and our planning um
 
04:55:57.670 --> 04:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
group and um there's a lot of overlap u
 
04:56:00.230 --> 04:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
a huge issue for us nowadays is 91a
 
04:56:02.350 --> 04:56:02.360 align:start position:0%
requests as you know state every state
 
04:56:05.070 --> 04:56:05.080 align:start position:0%
agency um so we we get a lot of requests
 
04:56:07.030 --> 04:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
for that this is the same unit that also
 
04:56:10.030 --> 04:56:10.040 align:start position:0%
develops our rules for us um Craig
 
04:56:12.430 --> 04:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
mention men we have uh 38 chapters of
 
04:56:14.270 --> 04:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
rules I think um I do want to make a
 
04:56:15.868 --> 04:56:15.878 align:start position:0%
quick point about rules because we've
 
04:56:17.230 --> 04:56:17.240 align:start position:0%
gotten a lot of questions this year
 
04:56:18.628 --> 04:56:18.638 align:start position:0%
there seems to be a
 
04:56:21.110 --> 04:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
misconception um all of our rules are
 
04:56:23.510 --> 04:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
adopted pursuant to statute and and
 
04:56:26.788 --> 04:56:26.798 align:start position:0%
every one of those rules is um passed
 
04:56:29.510 --> 04:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
through uh and approved by jail car uh
 
04:56:31.590 --> 04:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
so um we don't just go out and adopt
 
04:56:33.708 --> 04:56:33.718 align:start position:0%
rules for the heck of it we uh every one
 
04:56:37.470 --> 04:56:37.480 align:start position:0%
of our rules has a statutory basis and
 
04:56:39.750 --> 04:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
um uh again again they go through jail
 
04:56:42.270 --> 04:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
car for approval so um we've got a
 
04:56:44.190 --> 04:56:44.200 align:start position:0%
number of inquiries this this year from
 
04:56:46.110 --> 04:56:46.120 align:start position:0%
legislators about why did you adopt this
 
04:56:48.750 --> 04:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
rule why you know Etc and do you have
 
04:56:51.350 --> 04:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
any legal authority to do that well we
 
04:56:52.948 --> 04:56:52.958 align:start position:0%
we do and that Authority comes from
 
04:56:55.670 --> 04:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
statute and that statute comes from this
 
04:57:00.910 --> 04:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:03.590 --> 04:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
um Regional greenhouse gas program we
 
04:57:05.110 --> 04:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
can spend a lot of time on that
 
04:57:07.150 --> 04:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
basically it's a coalition of northeast
 
04:57:10.150 --> 04:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
states that uh regulate CO2 emissions
 
04:57:14.510 --> 04:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
from power plants and um uh you can see
 
04:57:16.990 --> 04:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
there's uh from time to time States New
 
04:57:19.788 --> 04:57:19.798 align:start position:0%
Jersey was in originally came out went
 
04:57:22.830 --> 04:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
back in uh Pennsylvania and Virginia are
 
04:57:24.910 --> 04:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
are going through different um
 
04:57:27.708 --> 04:57:27.718 align:start position:0%
considerations right now so on so this
 
04:57:30.788 --> 04:57:30.798 align:start position:0%
chart will actually change this year um
 
04:57:32.310 --> 04:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
as different states come in and out of
 
04:57:32.320 --> 04:57:33.868 align:start position:0%
as different states come in and out of
the

04:57:33.868 --> 04:57:33.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:57:36.548 --> 04:57:36.558 align:start position:0%
program and the way the program works
 
04:57:40.430 --> 04:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
basically is uh it it regulates uh any
 
04:57:42.590 --> 04:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
power plant any fossil fuel power plant
 
04:57:47.230 --> 04:57:47.240 align:start position:0%
that uh is 25 megawatts or greater in
 
04:57:49.990 --> 04:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
size and we identify the emissions from
 
04:57:53.150 --> 04:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
those we set an emissions cap uh that's
 
04:57:56.788 --> 04:57:56.798 align:start position:0%
a regional cap it's not a per state uh
 
04:57:59.628 --> 04:57:59.638 align:start position:0%
cap uh each state then issues allowances
 
04:58:01.510 --> 04:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
for the emissions that come from its
 
04:58:04.310 --> 04:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
power plants um in New Hampshire we have
 
04:58:06.070 --> 04:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
several sources including the marac
 
04:58:08.390 --> 04:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
station plant the plant in London Dair
 
04:58:11.270 --> 04:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
the plant in Newington um there
 
04:58:14.350 --> 04:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
uh you know the shill plant used to be
 
04:58:17.670 --> 04:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh one that's that's closed down now um
 
04:58:21.470 --> 04:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
but uh we uh issue allowances for those
 
04:58:23.788 --> 04:58:23.798 align:start position:0%
sources to operate and then the number
 
04:58:25.708 --> 04:58:25.718 align:start position:0%
of allowances the allowance cap goes
 
04:58:28.070 --> 04:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
down over time and sources have to
 
04:58:31.150 --> 04:58:31.160 align:start position:0%
purchase these allowances in order to to
 
04:58:33.430 --> 04:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
Emit and so that's they they work to
 
04:58:36.070 --> 04:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
lower their emissions and that program's
 
04:58:38.350 --> 04:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
been in place since roughly
 
04:58:42.270 --> 04:58:42.280 align:start position:0%
2009 and uh also goes through uh reviews
 
04:58:43.910 --> 04:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
every few years we're in the process of
 
04:58:46.190 --> 04:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
working with the other states right now
 
04:58:50.230 --> 04:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
to uh to review it and determine um if
 
04:58:51.590 --> 04:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
there are changes that should be made to
 
04:58:53.390 --> 04:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
that program but that program is in
 
04:58:56.990 --> 04:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
sconed in statute um uh RSA
 
04:58:59.628 --> 04:58:59.638 align:start position:0%
1225 and if we want to change that we
 
04:59:01.868 --> 04:59:01.878 align:start position:0%
need to come to you and get the uh get
 
04:59:03.510 --> 04:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
the approval of the legislature to make
 
04:59:05.788 --> 04:59:05.798 align:start position:0%
that any statutory changes to that
 
04:59:08.030 --> 04:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
program so anything that we work with
 
04:59:10.110 --> 04:59:10.120 align:start position:0%
the other states on implementing we
 
04:59:11.548 --> 04:59:11.558 align:start position:0%
can't just agree and say oh yeah we'll
 
04:59:13.390 --> 04:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
do that we have to come bring it back
 
04:59:18.390 --> 04:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
here you agree then we have the then
 
04:59:21.390 --> 04:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
then we'll work with the other states to
 
04:59:24.310 --> 04:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
implement um another area that we uh
 
04:59:26.150 --> 04:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
have in the air division is our
 
04:59:28.310 --> 04:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
environmental health program this
 
04:59:31.590 --> 04:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
program uh goes across all the divisions
 
04:59:35.030 --> 04:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
um does a lot of work uh on uh uh
 
04:59:37.070 --> 04:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
environmental health issues
 
04:59:41.230 --> 04:59:41.240 align:start position:0%
education uh and um also so when we get
 
04:59:44.990 --> 04:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
receive uh concerns uh issues like PS in
 
04:59:47.990 --> 04:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
in miramac and so on um we have staff
 
04:59:49.590 --> 04:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
that look look into those they help us
 
04:59:51.868 --> 04:59:51.878 align:start position:0%
develop standards um give us an
 
04:59:54.910 --> 04:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
environmental uh a health basis and a
 
04:59:57.270 --> 04:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
scientific basis for for a lot of the
 
04:59:59.110 --> 04:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
work that we do and you'll hear a little
 
05:00:02.230 --> 05:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
bit few minutes from um Dr John patali
 
05:00:05.470 --> 05:00:05.480 align:start position:0%
who's in in this group uh uh relative to
 
05:00:07.470 --> 05:00:07.480 align:start position:0%
uh PF Health standards that was one of
 
05:00:10.708 --> 05:00:10.718 align:start position:0%
the questions that was uh asked of us so
 
05:00:12.628 --> 05:00:12.638 align:start position:0%
uh and and we do work with other state
 
05:00:15.190 --> 05:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
agencies as well
 
05:00:19.150 --> 05:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
um so relative to pest very quickly uh
 
05:00:21.150 --> 05:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
you all are aware that several years ago
 
05:00:25.350 --> 05:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
St gobain um provided information to De
 
05:00:27.990 --> 05:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
that um uh significant emissions that
 
05:00:30.190 --> 05:00:30.200 align:start position:0%
had come from that plant and those
 
05:00:33.230 --> 05:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
emissions uh resulted in uh groundwater
 
05:00:35.510 --> 05:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
contamination this is one of the few
 
05:00:37.868 --> 05:00:37.878 align:start position:0%
pollutants that actually goes into the
 
05:00:40.708 --> 05:00:40.718 align:start position:0%
air is deposited on the ground and then
 
05:00:43.350 --> 05:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
gets into groundwater and it created a
 
05:00:46.708 --> 05:00:46.718 align:start position:0%
very significant groundwater problem um
 
05:00:51.510 --> 05:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
and so uh we worked with st gobain um to
 
05:00:52.628 --> 05:00:52.638 align:start position:0%
first of all we worked with the
 
05:00:56.350 --> 05:00:56.360 align:start position:0%
legislature to develop um a statute that
 
05:00:59.350 --> 05:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
required uh emissions controls because
 
05:01:01.430 --> 05:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
this was an area that we just didn't
 
05:01:04.230 --> 05:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
have uh strong uh requirements on other
 
05:01:07.910 --> 05:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
than under area toxics requirement uh we
 
05:01:10.470 --> 05:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
worked closely with st gobain we
 
05:01:12.708 --> 05:01:12.718 align:start position:0%
uh measured their emissions we did Stack
 
05:01:14.628 --> 05:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
testing we required them to do stack
 
05:01:17.110 --> 05:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
testing um we actually worked with EPA
 
05:01:18.788 --> 05:01:18.798 align:start position:0%
to establish the requirements for these
 
05:01:21.708 --> 05:01:21.718 align:start position:0%
stack tests so that we did did uh
 
05:01:25.510 --> 05:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
address a wide variety of p pasas is as
 
05:01:27.310 --> 05:01:27.320 align:start position:0%
Greg mentioned with ozone it's a soup
 
05:01:29.788 --> 05:01:29.798 align:start position:0%
it's it's hundreds of compounds
 
05:01:33.030 --> 05:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
literally so um uh New Hampshire has
 
05:01:35.750 --> 05:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
four that are are uh the way that the
 
05:01:37.788 --> 05:01:37.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire statute works is if we
 
05:01:39.948 --> 05:01:39.958 align:start position:0%
adopt a water standard then the water
 
05:01:41.990 --> 05:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
standard requires that the air emissions
 
05:01:45.430 --> 05:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
be evaluated as as well and we have four
 
05:01:48.708 --> 05:01:48.718 align:start position:0%
that we have water standards for um so
 
05:01:50.470 --> 05:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
this is a pollutant that actually works
 
05:01:52.628 --> 05:01:52.638 align:start position:0%
backwards from water to the air to the
 
05:01:55.628 --> 05:01:55.638 align:start position:0%
Smoke Stack and then to the control to
 
05:01:59.628 --> 05:01:59.638 align:start position:0%
controls uh and uh that's a very unusual
 
05:02:01.788 --> 05:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
situation we're currently doing Ru
 
05:02:05.350 --> 05:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
making under the uh uh statute that was
 
05:02:06.708 --> 05:02:06.718 align:start position:0%
established in
 
05:02:10.430 --> 05:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
2016 and uh again we've focused very
 
05:02:12.868 --> 05:02:12.878 align:start position:0%
very closely our major issue with pasas
 
05:02:15.150 --> 05:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
is obviously the St gobain facility
 
05:02:17.750 --> 05:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
which has announced their closing um and
 
05:02:20.270 --> 05:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
uh but they have installed controls that
 
05:02:23.548 --> 05:02:23.558 align:start position:0%
were all directed by us um uh a
 
05:02:25.990 --> 05:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
regenerative thermal oxidizer to uh
 
05:02:29.230 --> 05:02:29.240 align:start position:0%
lower their p p emissions tremendously
 
05:02:32.110 --> 05:02:32.120 align:start position:0%
and um uh that was all done uh through
 
05:02:34.190 --> 05:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
our uh through our permitting and under
 
05:02:36.788 --> 05:02:36.798 align:start position:0%
the requirements of the uh RSA
 
05:02:38.788 --> 05:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
125 uh that were
 
05:02:41.670 --> 05:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
established so again the legislation s
 
05:02:45.590 --> 05:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
SP 309 in 2018 um gave us the authority
 
05:02:48.590 --> 05:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
to deal with these pollutants um we've
 
05:02:50.030 --> 05:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
we established the standards and
 
05:02:53.390 --> 05:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
required the uh uh emissions controls at
 
05:02:55.708 --> 05:02:55.718 align:start position:0%
s go Bane and now we're working on rules
 
05:02:57.390 --> 05:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
that would affect any other sources that
 
05:02:59.948 --> 05:02:59.958 align:start position:0%
came into New Hampshire or that might
 
05:03:04.070 --> 05:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
change their uh processes and
 
05:03:07.548 --> 05:03:07.558 align:start position:0%
potentially emit any FAS um and we're in
 
05:03:09.070 --> 05:03:09.080 align:start position:0%
the process of going through that rul
 
05:03:12.628 --> 05:03:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:14.910 --> 05:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
I think
 
05:03:20.470 --> 05:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
I um so uh yeah also that legislation
 
05:03:26.390 --> 05:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
did create um Dr Pat's p position and uh
 
05:03:29.750 --> 05:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
it required us to develop a plan for um
 
05:03:31.470 --> 05:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
for developing surface water quality
 
05:03:34.430 --> 05:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
standards that would then further uh uh
 
05:03:37.390 --> 05:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
further address different past compounds
 
05:03:39.750 --> 05:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
and um so using that general fund
 
05:03:41.510 --> 05:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation we were able to hire a
 
05:03:44.628 --> 05:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
couple of staff and including Dr patali
 
05:03:48.510 --> 05:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
and um requires us to do uh reviews
 
05:03:51.750 --> 05:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
every five years of the uh uh P
 
05:03:54.270 --> 05:03:54.280 align:start position:0%
pollutants to determine if other aqs are
 
05:03:57.070 --> 05:03:57.080 align:start position:0%
necessary representative Thomas thank
 
05:03:59.990 --> 05:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um taking my mask off for
 
05:04:01.868 --> 05:04:01.878 align:start position:0%
this one so you can hear me um I'm
 
05:04:04.070 --> 05:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
wondering if you can comment on the
 
05:04:07.270 --> 05:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
efficacy of monitored natural
 
05:04:10.990 --> 05:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
attenuation Mna as a mediation strategy
 
05:04:13.868 --> 05:04:13.878 align:start position:0%
specifically for past chemicals I would
 
05:04:16.030 --> 05:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
prefer you have ke kept your mask on so
 
05:04:19.470 --> 05:04:19.480 align:start position:0%
I couldn't because I I that's not an an
 
05:04:21.270 --> 05:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
area that I'm certainly familiar with
 
05:04:23.990 --> 05:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
but perhaps Dr patelli does that have
 
05:04:24.000 --> 05:04:26.270 align:start position:0%
but perhaps Dr patelli does that have
any

05:04:26.270 --> 05:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:04:28.510 --> 05:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
so you're you're next on the slide
 
05:04:31.868 --> 05:04:31.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:33.910 --> 05:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
anyway thank thank you thank you for
 
05:04:38.628 --> 05:04:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:38.638 --> 05:04:41.788 align:start position:0%
 
out

05:04:41.788 --> 05:04:41.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:43.990 --> 05:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
so that's something that I would also
 
05:04:45.470 --> 05:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
still to defer over to the waste
 
05:04:47.670 --> 05:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
management divis division so I know Mike
 
05:04:49.510 --> 05:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
whimet at the recent pest commission
 
05:04:51.430 --> 05:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
discussed that issue about natural
 
05:04:53.470 --> 05:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
attenuation and where that plays into
 
05:04:55.670 --> 05:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
remediation plans depending on what
 
05:04:58.708 --> 05:04:58.718 align:start position:0%
technology is available and feasible and
 
05:05:00.390 --> 05:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
what media is being assessed for
 
05:05:03.670 --> 05:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
mediation so ultimately I would still
 
05:05:08.070 --> 05:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
defer out to them yes followup followup
 
05:05:11.150 --> 05:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
um I'll for those who are not familiar
 
05:05:14.030 --> 05:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
with m&amp; it it is simply waiting for
 
05:05:16.030 --> 05:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
these chemicals to degrade these are
 
05:05:18.230 --> 05:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
however forever chemicals that do not
 
05:05:21.430 --> 05:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
degrade so how can that be considered an
 
05:05:22.708 --> 05:05:22.718 align:start position:0%
Avenue of
 
05:05:24.670 --> 05:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
remediation again you'd have to ask some
 
05:05:26.590 --> 05:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
of the engineers about that with a lot
 
05:05:28.590 --> 05:05:28.600 align:start position:0%
of other we call them recalcitrant
 
05:05:30.430 --> 05:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
chemicals that stick around for a long
 
05:05:33.670 --> 05:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
time if we don't have the technology to
 
05:05:36.948 --> 05:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
break them down and we can't move them
 
05:05:38.310 --> 05:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
from a
 
05:05:40.990 --> 05:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
site that's pretty much the option
 
05:05:42.510 --> 05:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
that's left so if you don't have any
 
05:05:44.430 --> 05:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
technology to fix it and you don't want
 
05:05:47.190 --> 05:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
to move it and make it another communi
 
05:05:49.830 --> 05:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
problem we run into that with a lot of
 
05:05:49.840 --> 05:05:53.910 align:start position:0%
problem we run into that with a lot of
organic

05:05:53.910 --> 05:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:55.910 --> 05:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
contaminants okay go
 
05:05:59.390 --> 05:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
ahead um so you're saying if these
 
05:06:01.310 --> 05:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
chemicals because they cannot be broken
 
05:06:04.990 --> 05:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
down will forever be in that area would
 
05:06:08.230 --> 05:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire uh put some
 
05:06:11.510 --> 05:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
kind of financial burden on this company
 
05:06:14.150 --> 05:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
because of that for remediation purposes
 
05:06:16.510 --> 05:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
I know Mike whims that yeah cuz that's
 
05:06:18.510 --> 05:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
for the waste division director I'm a
 
05:06:21.430 --> 05:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
toxicologist y I'll just I'll just add
 
05:06:23.190 --> 05:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
very quickly I think that one one of the
 
05:06:25.030 --> 05:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
issues here is that there's some thought
 
05:06:27.190 --> 05:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
that there would be attenuation of these
 
05:06:28.868 --> 05:06:28.878 align:start position:0%
chemicals if we eliminate the source
 
05:06:30.548 --> 05:06:30.558 align:start position:0%
which was coming out of the Smoke Stack
 
05:06:32.230 --> 05:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
that over time they although they don't
 
05:06:33.990 --> 05:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
break down there would be some
 
05:06:38.548 --> 05:06:38.558 align:start position:0%
attenuation um so uh the the amount
 
05:06:39.590 --> 05:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
that's in the ground and in the
 
05:06:41.910 --> 05:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
groundwater will eventually decline
 
05:06:43.430 --> 05:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
somewhat but it's not due to breakdown
 
05:06:46.788 --> 05:06:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:49.310 --> 05:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
chemical representative Noel thank you
 
05:06:52.470 --> 05:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman in Berlin in the Androgen
 
05:06:54.868 --> 05:06:54.878 align:start position:0%
River we have dioxin which is a
 
05:06:56.590 --> 05:06:56.600 align:start position:0%
comparable chemical it doesn't break
 
05:06:59.708 --> 05:06:59.718 align:start position:0%
down and the the river now has a
 
05:07:03.868 --> 05:07:03.878 align:start position:0%
classique uh uh grade in that section
 
05:07:06.310 --> 05:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
where the dioxin is found and it's my
 
05:07:08.270 --> 05:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
understanding your department comes up I
 
05:07:11.310 --> 05:07:11.320 align:start position:0%
believe annually and tests uh in tests
 
05:07:14.430 --> 05:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
the river catches fish and sees if any
 
05:07:17.070 --> 05:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
dioxin is being accumulated that's how
 
05:07:19.510 --> 05:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's being handled in the Andersen River
 
05:07:21.270 --> 05:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so again that's something that I
 
05:07:22.548 --> 05:07:22.558 align:start position:0%
would defer to the waste management
 
05:07:24.510 --> 05:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
division for a more in-depth explanation
 
05:07:26.548 --> 05:07:26.558 align:start position:0%
of how those kind of decisions are made
 
05:07:28.830 --> 05:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
on attenuation plans but that is
 
05:07:31.910 --> 05:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
something we do see with dioxins pcbs
 
05:07:33.750 --> 05:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
Organic pesticides that have been used
 
05:07:36.628 --> 05:07:36.638 align:start position:0%
for decades where if there's no
 
05:07:38.670 --> 05:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
technology to remove them effectively
 
05:07:42.150 --> 05:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
from the soil to break them down there
 
05:07:43.788 --> 05:07:43.798 align:start position:0%
then the question is what's the
 
05:07:43.798 --> 05:07:47.830 align:start position:0%
then the question is what's the
alternative

05:07:47.830 --> 05:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:47.840 --> 05:07:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
option

05:07:49.910 --> 05:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
option
 
05:07:53.390 --> 05:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
okay okay I will go ahead and proceed
 
05:07:57.070 --> 05:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
back into more P discussion so um again
 
05:07:58.628 --> 05:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
for everyone that hasn't met me before
 
05:08:00.708 --> 05:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
I'm Dr jonath Pali I'm the toxicologist
 
05:08:01.510 --> 05:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire Department
 
05:08:03.230 --> 05:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
environmental services I've been here
 
05:08:05.750 --> 05:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
since about 2018 working primarily on
 
05:08:07.910 --> 05:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
past but also some of my time is spent
 
05:08:09.670 --> 05:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
working on other contaminants that have
 
05:08:12.628 --> 05:08:12.638 align:start position:0%
in the state so my role is to understand
 
05:08:14.510 --> 05:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
how exposure to chemicals can lead to
 
05:08:15.788 --> 05:08:15.798 align:start position:0%
health effects and help make
 
05:08:17.990 --> 05:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations towards our standards
 
05:08:19.110 --> 05:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
that are meant to be either Health
 
05:08:21.548 --> 05:08:21.558 align:start position:0%
protective or to also look at specific
 
05:08:23.590 --> 05:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
site investigations so at things like
 
05:08:25.868 --> 05:08:25.878 align:start position:0%
super fund sites spills other things
 
05:08:27.750 --> 05:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
that we have around the state and try to
 
05:08:30.990 --> 05:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
inform that so when it comes to past I
 
05:08:32.670 --> 05:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
think everyone's somewhat familiar with
 
05:08:34.350 --> 05:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
this so I kept my part of the
 
05:08:36.390 --> 05:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
presentation pretty high level because I
 
05:08:38.390 --> 05:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
realize it's late in the day and I just
 
05:08:40.390 --> 05:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
came after everyone else so I don't want
 
05:08:42.150 --> 05:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
to punish everyone with chemical
 
05:08:44.750 --> 05:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
structures but P stands for per and poly
 
05:08:47.390 --> 05:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
floraly substances this is a very large
 
05:08:49.990 --> 05:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
growing family of chemicals they are
 
05:08:52.070 --> 05:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
characterized by having Florine attached
 
05:08:53.708 --> 05:08:53.718 align:start position:0%
which gives them really unique
 
05:08:55.990 --> 05:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
properties one of those main properties
 
05:08:58.430 --> 05:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
is persistence and the ability to resist
 
05:09:00.628 --> 05:09:00.638 align:start position:0%
degradation so when these end up in our
 
05:09:02.470 --> 05:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
environment they don't necessarily break
 
05:09:05.230 --> 05:09:05.240 align:start position:0%
down on a meaningful timeline these
 
05:09:06.548 --> 05:09:06.558 align:start position:0%
chemicals like everything else they do
 
05:09:08.390 --> 05:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
have halflife but that's on an order of
 
05:09:09.868 --> 05:09:09.878 align:start position:0%
decades to centuries
 
05:09:12.350 --> 05:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
so us and our grandchildren will be long
 
05:09:14.110 --> 05:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
gone before several of these have
 
05:09:16.230 --> 05:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
actually broken down in the
 
05:09:18.948 --> 05:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
environment what is concerning for
 
05:09:21.150 --> 05:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
several of these is that there is
 
05:09:23.070 --> 05:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
potential for exposure and that is
 
05:09:24.948 --> 05:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
primarily through ingestion or drinking
 
05:09:26.510 --> 05:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
water that's the main way that these
 
05:09:29.270 --> 05:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
chemicals get into most people's bodies
 
05:09:30.708 --> 05:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
when we look around the state so if
 
05:09:32.628 --> 05:09:32.638 align:start position:0%
you're looking at this map here these
 
05:09:35.310 --> 05:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
are just private well results from
 
05:09:37.390 --> 05:09:37.400 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire and where it is
 
05:09:39.948 --> 05:09:39.958 align:start position:0%
green means it is below our standard
 
05:09:41.788 --> 05:09:41.798 align:start position:0%
where it is orange or yellow it is above
 
05:09:44.750 --> 05:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
our state standard and where it is red
 
05:09:46.390 --> 05:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
that means it is even higher than the
 
05:09:49.070 --> 05:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
epa's previous unenforceable advisory
 
05:09:50.110 --> 05:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
for these
 
05:09:52.230 --> 05:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
compounds if you actually pull up one of
 
05:09:54.270 --> 05:09:54.280 align:start position:0%
our maps that we do have on our website
 
05:09:55.708 --> 05:09:55.718 align:start position:0%
you can also see that these compounds
 
05:09:57.548 --> 05:09:57.558 align:start position:0%
are detected all of our soils and part
 
05:09:59.510 --> 05:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
of that is because of releases from
 
05:10:02.110 --> 05:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
industrial sites releases from old
 
05:10:04.590 --> 05:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
landfill sites or where people had waste
 
05:10:05.910 --> 05:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
and there's also potential that these
 
05:10:08.350 --> 05:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
may be long range transported compounds
 
05:10:10.430 --> 05:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
in the atmosphere
 
05:10:12.310 --> 05:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
so for my role at the state it's trying
 
05:10:13.830 --> 05:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
to understand how do these impact
 
05:10:15.708 --> 05:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
People's Health and this is a rapidly
 
05:10:17.628 --> 05:10:17.638 align:start position:0%
area or rapidly evolving area of
 
05:10:19.510 --> 05:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
research so one of the things I also do
 
05:10:21.350 --> 05:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
in my role is I participate in a lot of
 
05:10:23.628 --> 05:10:23.638 align:start position:0%
Interstate work groups that works
 
05:10:25.390 --> 05:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
amongst different states we also work
 
05:10:27.030 --> 05:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
with our federal Partners we also work
 
05:10:28.430 --> 05:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
with folks in the private research
 
05:10:30.868 --> 05:10:30.878 align:start position:0%
sector and at the local universities to
 
05:10:32.750 --> 05:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
try to understand what are the issues
 
05:10:34.750 --> 05:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
with past how do we think about cleanup
 
05:10:37.750 --> 05:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
of these reducing exposure and even here
 
05:10:39.548 --> 05:10:39.558 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire our program the
 
05:10:40.910 --> 05:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
environmental health program has been
 
05:10:42.910 --> 05:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
really successful in leveraging small
 
05:10:44.948 --> 05:10:44.958 align:start position:0%
amounts of State funds to secure large
 
05:10:47.910 --> 05:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
Federal funding to investigate specific
 
05:10:51.350 --> 05:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
local P concerns so one of those issues
 
05:10:53.030 --> 05:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
is basically what I call Magic where we
 
05:10:56.270 --> 05:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
took $10,000 from our own State funding
 
05:10:58.430 --> 05:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
we matched it with Dartmouth and we got
 
05:11:01.628 --> 05:11:01.638 align:start position:0%
a $1 million Grant to understand past
 
05:11:03.830 --> 05:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
impacts on some of our Coastal
 
05:11:05.910 --> 05:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
ecosystems so it's trying to leverage
 
05:11:08.390 --> 05:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
those resources our state expertise but
 
05:11:09.708 --> 05:11:09.718 align:start position:0%
we're also trying to Boler up the
 
05:11:11.430 --> 05:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
ability of local research institutions
 
05:11:13.788 --> 05:11:13.798 align:start position:0%
to answer some of these questions so
 
05:11:15.510 --> 05:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's not always the department having to
 
05:11:17.548 --> 05:11:17.558 align:start position:0%
use our state funding to address these
 
05:11:19.430 --> 05:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
problems because sometimes we have
 
05:11:21.110 --> 05:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
issues related to site investigations
 
05:11:23.230 --> 05:11:23.240 align:start position:0%
that we need to look into but there can
 
05:11:25.230 --> 05:11:25.240 align:start position:0%
also be broader research questions that
 
05:11:27.430 --> 05:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
we're not a research institution and
 
05:11:29.750 --> 05:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
we're not staffed or resourced to answer
 
05:11:32.110 --> 05:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
some of those questions so I'm really
 
05:11:33.350 --> 05:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
proud of a lot of the Partnerships that
 
05:11:34.990 --> 05:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
we developed within the state and we're
 
05:11:36.230 --> 05:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
really actually building a lot of that
 
05:11:38.190 --> 05:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
capacity to do more work
 
05:11:38.200 --> 05:11:40.868 align:start position:0%
capacity to do more work
here

05:11:40.868 --> 05:11:40.878 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:11:42.190 --> 05:11:42.200 align:start position:0%
now one of the questions I believe we
 
05:11:45.110 --> 05:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
got an email was explaining the
 
05:11:47.510 --> 05:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
associations and causation relationship
 
05:11:51.190 --> 05:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
between past health effects and exposure
 
05:11:52.830 --> 05:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
and this is something that has been
 
05:11:56.110 --> 05:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
reviewed in a lot of different settings
 
05:11:58.548 --> 05:11:58.558 align:start position:0%
by either federal agencies International
 
05:12:01.590 --> 05:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
groups independent panels various
 
05:12:03.030 --> 05:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
programs that the federal government
 
05:12:05.030 --> 05:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
including the national toxicology
 
05:12:07.470 --> 05:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
program where they've looked at this and
 
05:12:09.230 --> 05:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
they found that there are a lot of
 
05:12:12.708 --> 05:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
associations between P but right when we
 
05:12:14.788 --> 05:12:14.798 align:start position:0%
think about associations being causation
 
05:12:17.150 --> 05:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
that's not the case but what they have
 
05:12:19.070 --> 05:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
also looked at is the issue of is their
 
05:12:21.548 --> 05:12:21.558 align:start position:0%
biological plausibility right so when we
 
05:12:23.750 --> 05:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
look inside of animal model studies when
 
05:12:25.670 --> 05:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
we look in human cell lines that have
 
05:12:28.270 --> 05:12:28.280 align:start position:0%
been isolated when we look in cohort
 
05:12:29.910 --> 05:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
studies that are held by the National
 
05:12:32.310 --> 05:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
Cancer Institute do we see some of these
 
05:12:34.510 --> 05:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
relationships and effects holding up and
 
05:12:37.310 --> 05:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
we do so a lot of these seem to be
 
05:12:39.190 --> 05:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
focused on effects on the immune system
 
05:12:41.868 --> 05:12:41.878 align:start position:0%
system basic changes in lipid metabolism
 
05:12:44.030 --> 05:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
and liver toxicity and some changes in
 
05:12:46.948 --> 05:12:46.958 align:start position:0%
the hormones of our endocrine system and
 
05:12:48.750 --> 05:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
right now actually the carcinogenicity
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
is being re-evaluated by the US EPA
 
05:12:53.628 --> 05:12:53.638 align:start position:0%
because based on the available evidence
 
05:12:55.390 --> 05:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
that they have to date they're looking
 
05:12:57.310 --> 05:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
at reclassifying these as known
 
05:12:59.230 --> 05:12:59.240 align:start position:0%
carcinogens at least one of the
 
05:13:01.150 --> 05:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
compounds there have been some other
 
05:13:03.470 --> 05:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
groups that have looked at this but
 
05:13:04.990 --> 05:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
these are all sort of groups are kinding
 
05:13:08.390 --> 05:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
with the same concern basically that we
 
05:13:09.948 --> 05:13:09.958 align:start position:0%
see a lot of these associations there's
 
05:13:11.548 --> 05:13:11.558 align:start position:0%
a lot of evidence for biological
 
05:13:13.990 --> 05:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
plausibility there so it's not just
 
05:13:15.788 --> 05:13:15.798 align:start position:0%
coincidence but what I will say is
 
05:13:17.150 --> 05:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of debate about the
 
05:13:19.190 --> 05:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
magnitude of it and that is one of the
 
05:13:20.910 --> 05:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
areas that there is still uncertainty
 
05:13:22.310 --> 05:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons where we see
 
05:13:23.910 --> 05:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
new health assessments coming out all
 
05:13:26.390 --> 05:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
the time about this is that question of
 
05:13:28.830 --> 05:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
what's the strength of that relationship
 
05:13:31.788 --> 05:13:31.798 align:start position:0%
so sort of the analogy I give is if
 
05:13:33.750 --> 05:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
everyone in here spontaneously started
 
05:13:35.788 --> 05:13:35.798 align:start position:0%
seeing five cents go into your bank
 
05:13:38.270 --> 05:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
account every day that you never saw
 
05:13:41.070 --> 05:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
before that is still significant what
 
05:13:42.628 --> 05:13:42.638 align:start position:0%
would be more significant is if your
 
05:13:45.750 --> 05:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
bank account Changed by 5% every day
 
05:13:47.310 --> 05:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
that would be more
 
05:13:48.868 --> 05:13:48.878 align:start position:0%
significant that's one of the things
 
05:13:51.190 --> 05:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
that's being debated and that's actually
 
05:13:53.590 --> 05:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
sort of behind where EPA has come up
 
05:13:55.590 --> 05:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
with their proposed standards that have
 
05:13:58.628 --> 05:13:58.638 align:start position:0%
not been finalized of lowering the
 
05:14:00.910 --> 05:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
standard for PF actually establishing a
 
05:14:02.070 --> 05:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
standard because they didn't have an
 
05:14:04.548 --> 05:14:04.558 align:start position:0%
enforceable number before but for pfoa
 
05:14:07.390 --> 05:14:07.400 align:start position:0%
and pfos to four parts per trillion
 
05:14:09.590 --> 05:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
currently New Hampshire has m CLS which
 
05:14:11.430 --> 05:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
are enforcable drinking water standards
 
05:14:13.910 --> 05:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
for four of these compounds we have
 
05:14:16.868 --> 05:14:16.878 align:start position:0%
individual numbers for those for two of
 
05:14:19.310 --> 05:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
them EPA proposed separate numbers and
 
05:14:21.948 --> 05:14:21.958 align:start position:0%
then there's a family of four past that
 
05:14:24.190 --> 05:14:24.200 align:start position:0%
they've called a hazard index and I
 
05:14:25.708 --> 05:14:25.718 align:start position:0%
didn't include a slide that's a bunch of
 
05:14:27.470 --> 05:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
algebra but if anyone wants to see how
 
05:14:29.670 --> 05:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
that's done I'm happy to do
 
05:14:32.910 --> 05:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
it one things to bear in mind is this is
 
05:14:35.070 --> 05:14:35.080 align:start position:0%
a proposed standard we are still waiting
 
05:14:37.670 --> 05:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
for them to finalize that in the coming
 
05:14:39.910 --> 05:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
weeks maybe um it seems to depend on who
 
05:14:41.788 --> 05:14:41.798 align:start position:0%
you talk at talk to at the EPA where it
 
05:14:43.628 --> 05:14:43.638 align:start position:0%
goes from weeks to months to maybe the
 
05:14:45.150 --> 05:14:45.160 align:start position:0%
end of the year we're not entirely sure
 
05:14:47.788 --> 05:14:47.798 align:start position:0%
at this point but something that's
 
05:14:50.430 --> 05:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
important to note is these are for
 
05:14:51.708 --> 05:14:51.718 align:start position:0%
Public Water Systems these are
 
05:14:54.510 --> 05:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
enforcable standards in New Hampshire we
 
05:14:56.470 --> 05:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
do have a groundwater standard which is
 
05:14:57.750 --> 05:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things that drives a lot of
 
05:14:59.590 --> 05:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
that private well testing that we did
 
05:15:00.990 --> 05:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
and recommending people to pursue
 
05:15:02.310 --> 05:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
treatment that's one of the reasons we
 
05:15:04.310 --> 05:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
have a rebate program in the state it's
 
05:15:06.390 --> 05:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
because nearly 47% of our residents in
 
05:15:08.670 --> 05:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
the state are on private Wells they're
 
05:15:10.590 --> 05:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
not public water systems that have the
 
05:15:12.390 --> 05:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
resources to look into putting treatment
 
05:15:16.070 --> 05:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:18.830 --> 05:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
this so again we regulate for these in
 
05:15:20.628 --> 05:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
drinking water our department is looking
 
05:15:23.310 --> 05:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
at proposing essentially soil standards
 
05:15:26.270 --> 05:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
for an additional set of these compounds
 
05:15:28.070 --> 05:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
in the coming year that's still
 
05:15:29.470 --> 05:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
something that is being proposed and
 
05:15:31.270 --> 05:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
evaluated it would be a rule that would
 
05:15:33.750 --> 05:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
come from our waste division but we're
 
05:15:35.628 --> 05:15:35.638 align:start position:0%
also looking at setting for a limited
 
05:15:38.190 --> 05:15:38.200 align:start position:0%
number of surface water bodies similar
 
05:15:40.270 --> 05:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
standards because they are surface water
 
05:15:41.868 --> 05:15:41.878 align:start position:0%
bodies that are used as drinking water
 
05:15:43.830 --> 05:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
supplies for certain
 
05:15:45.948 --> 05:15:45.958 align:start position:0%
communities but past exposure is
 
05:15:48.270 --> 05:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
multifaceted it's not just drinking
 
05:15:51.708 --> 05:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
water it's also food packaging consumer
 
05:15:53.190 --> 05:15:53.200 align:start position:0%
products we're exposed to these
 
05:15:54.948 --> 05:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
compounds in a lot of ways and that's
 
05:15:56.350 --> 05:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
sort of what makes these unique compared
 
05:15:58.030 --> 05:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
to a lot of other contaminants that
 
05:16:01.590 --> 05:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
we've tried to evaluate oh
 
05:16:04.750 --> 05:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
sorry sure um knowing that there's over
 
05:16:07.270 --> 05:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
14,000 different past chemicals what
 
05:16:09.670 --> 05:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
would it take for New Hampshire to
 
05:16:13.750 --> 05:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
recognize past chemicals as a class so
 
05:16:16.190 --> 05:16:16.200 align:start position:0%
one of the things we'd run into is
 
05:16:18.150 --> 05:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
actually understanding which pasts occur
 
05:16:20.470 --> 05:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
and which ones we can measure for and
 
05:16:22.628 --> 05:16:22.638 align:start position:0%
actually having a way to treat them like
 
05:16:25.310 --> 05:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
a class that way so I know in current
 
05:16:26.948 --> 05:16:26.958 align:start position:0%
legislation I believe on product
 
05:16:29.548 --> 05:16:29.558 align:start position:0%
packaging they Define pasas as any
 
05:16:32.470 --> 05:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
carbon compound with a Florine on it we
 
05:16:34.110 --> 05:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
don't have an ability to measure all of
 
05:16:36.110 --> 05:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
those so we can't know if they're
 
05:16:39.390 --> 05:16:39.400 align:start position:0%
actually there or present and even when
 
05:16:42.750 --> 05:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
it comes to the larger 14,000 that could
 
05:16:44.548 --> 05:16:44.558 align:start position:0%
potentially be out there a lot of those
 
05:16:46.868 --> 05:16:46.878 align:start position:0%
are cast numbers for compounds that
 
05:16:48.788 --> 05:16:48.798 align:start position:0%
simply aren't used in Commerce they
 
05:16:49.948 --> 05:16:49.958 align:start position:0%
haven't made their way into the United
 
05:16:52.548 --> 05:16:52.558 align:start position:0%
States they're hypothetical compounds
 
05:16:54.110 --> 05:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
that can be designed in a computer
 
05:16:56.948 --> 05:16:56.958 align:start position:0%
software and then assigned a cast number
 
05:16:59.430 --> 05:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
so we would really focus more on which
 
05:17:01.910 --> 05:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
compounds can we detect can we actually
 
05:17:04.868 --> 05:17:04.878 align:start position:0%
measure for them what can we treat for
 
05:17:05.788 --> 05:17:05.798 align:start position:0%
those would be a lot of the other
 
05:17:07.230 --> 05:17:07.240 align:start position:0%
considerations that would go behind
 
05:17:10.910 --> 05:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:12.948 --> 05:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
um with regard to the the number of
 
05:17:15.708 --> 05:17:15.718 align:start position:0%
chemicals I know that um I think I had
 
05:17:18.750 --> 05:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
read that in the evaluation of the uh
 
05:17:21.628 --> 05:17:21.638 align:start position:0%
the the exhaust from s Cain there were
 
05:17:24.270 --> 05:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
108 past chemicals that were not
 
05:17:26.868 --> 05:17:26.878 align:start position:0%
identified that they were detected but
 
05:17:30.430 --> 05:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
but not identified um why is the state
 
05:17:32.230 --> 05:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire not getting a list of
 
05:17:35.788 --> 05:17:35.798 align:start position:0%
the chemicals that are being used and
 
05:17:39.150 --> 05:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
distributed from that facility so that
 
05:17:40.510 --> 05:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
would be a question either for Waste
 
05:17:40.520 --> 05:17:42.070 align:start position:0%
would be a question either for Waste
Management

05:17:42.070 --> 05:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
Management
 
05:17:44.190 --> 05:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
again again because that would come down
 
05:17:45.910 --> 05:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
to one what are the actual reporting
 
05:17:48.628 --> 05:17:48.638 align:start position:0%
requirements for what a company brings
 
05:17:51.628 --> 05:17:51.638 align:start position:0%
in and also do they actually know which
 
05:17:55.230 --> 05:17:55.240 align:start position:0%
pasts are coming in raw product so
 
05:17:56.628 --> 05:17:56.638 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that with a lot
 
05:17:58.230 --> 05:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
of folks looking at past across the
 
05:18:00.788 --> 05:18:00.798 align:start position:0%
country there's this big thing of
 
05:18:03.990 --> 05:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
intentional addition where you can also
 
05:18:06.548 --> 05:18:06.558 align:start position:0%
have various pests that show up in a lot
 
05:18:08.390 --> 05:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
of products that are unintentionally
 
05:18:08.400 --> 05:18:09.590 align:start position:0%
of products that are unintentionally
added

05:18:09.590 --> 05:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
added
 
05:18:11.628 --> 05:18:11.638 align:start position:0%
and even with something coming out of a
 
05:18:14.030 --> 05:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
stack or going through a process if it's
 
05:18:16.830 --> 05:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
a byproduct of that then that's
 
05:18:18.230 --> 05:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
different than having someone report
 
05:18:19.670 --> 05:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
something that's inside of a product
 
05:18:20.670 --> 05:18:20.680 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
05:18:24.310 --> 05:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
using and I suggest you get his card and
 
05:18:25.830 --> 05:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
she asked me maybe do a lot of this
 
05:18:25.840 --> 05:18:32.830 align:start position:0%
she asked me maybe do a lot of this
questioning

05:18:32.830 --> 05:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:37.708 --> 05:18:37.718 align:start position:0%
offline yep it's 10 minutes at three so
 
05:18:40.190 --> 05:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
yep so again just one of the challenges
 
05:18:41.830 --> 05:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
with pasts compared to a lot of other
 
05:18:43.830 --> 05:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
contaminants even things like dioxins
 
05:18:45.788 --> 05:18:45.798 align:start position:0%
that were mentioned earlier is these are
 
05:18:47.948 --> 05:18:47.958 align:start position:0%
in a lot of different media it's not
 
05:18:50.030 --> 05:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
just a water issue it's not just a soil
 
05:18:52.670 --> 05:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
issue it's we're finding it in a lot of
 
05:18:53.990 --> 05:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
different places and that's what's
 
05:18:55.788 --> 05:18:55.798 align:start position:0%
making it sort of unwieldly and
 
05:18:57.590 --> 05:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
challenging to deal with and that's also
 
05:18:59.070 --> 05:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
why it's getting a lot of attention
 
05:19:00.670 --> 05:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
because we haven't had a class of
 
05:19:02.868 --> 05:19:02.878 align:start position:0%
contaminants that affects so much
 
05:19:06.708 --> 05:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
different media like this before yeah uh
 
05:19:09.670 --> 05:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um and I realized we're all
 
05:19:11.948 --> 05:19:11.958 align:start position:0%
over the map but I'm trying to get a
 
05:19:13.948 --> 05:19:13.958 align:start position:0%
handle on you know how serious these
 
05:19:17.830 --> 05:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
various things are um relatively and the
 
05:19:19.708 --> 05:19:19.718 align:start position:0%
other one which is the elephant that's
 
05:19:21.470 --> 05:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
been in the room for well it's been here
 
05:19:24.350 --> 05:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
forever is arsenic and you know in terms
 
05:19:27.230 --> 05:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
of uh the danger to humans how do they
 
05:19:29.150 --> 05:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
all compare is there some way of rating
 
05:19:31.628 --> 05:19:31.638 align:start position:0%
them comparatively so we do have some
 
05:19:33.590 --> 05:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
ways of comparing those it's basically
 
05:19:36.070 --> 05:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
where we compare doses the issue is that
 
05:19:38.070 --> 05:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
they often cause different effects so we
 
05:19:40.548 --> 05:19:40.558 align:start position:0%
run into of we're comparing apples to
 
05:19:42.670 --> 05:19:42.680 align:start position:0%
oranges we can still compare the mass of
 
05:19:45.270 --> 05:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
an apple to an orange but it's still not
 
05:19:48.030 --> 05:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
quite the same comparison for pretty
 
05:19:49.390 --> 05:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
much any of these contaminants when it
 
05:19:51.110 --> 05:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
comes to drinking water if something is
 
05:19:53.190 --> 05:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
classified as a carcinogen our goal
 
05:19:57.070 --> 05:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
becomes zero and the limit that's set
 
05:19:59.628 --> 05:19:59.638 align:start position:0%
there is what we think is feasible and
 
05:20:01.470 --> 05:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
what people are willing to pay to get
 
05:20:04.190 --> 05:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
that out of public water and that's
 
05:20:06.470 --> 05:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
where the number four came from for
 
05:20:09.150 --> 05:20:09.160 align:start position:0%
epa's number it's not the
 
05:20:11.310 --> 05:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
definitive number that is safe according
 
05:20:13.390 --> 05:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
to them it's a number that we can
 
05:20:16.350 --> 05:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
reliably detect at this
 
05:20:19.750 --> 05:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
point Y so we do have more information
 
05:20:22.190 --> 05:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
on our website um there's a bunch of
 
05:20:24.670 --> 05:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
YouTube videos that also include
 
05:20:25.910 --> 05:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
presenting on the different work that
 
05:20:27.510 --> 05:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
we've been doing whether it's from the
 
05:20:29.708 --> 05:20:29.718 align:start position:0%
waste division from my own program from
 
05:20:31.430 --> 05:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
work we've been doing with our academic
 
05:20:33.230 --> 05:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
Partners Outreach we've done to
 
05:20:34.948 --> 05:20:34.958 align:start position:0%
different communities and trying to
 
05:20:37.110 --> 05:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
understand what concerns are so with
 
05:20:38.190 --> 05:20:38.200 align:start position:0%
that I just wanted to open up for
 
05:20:39.470 --> 05:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
questions cuz I realize we're near the
 
05:20:41.390 --> 05:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
end of this and people may have specific
 
05:20:44.590 --> 05:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
things that they want to get into
 
05:20:46.788 --> 05:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
yep so when I was looking at the map
 
05:20:48.948 --> 05:20:48.958 align:start position:0%
with the green and the red dots one of
 
05:20:50.510 --> 05:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
the red dots looked like it was right at
 
05:20:53.670 --> 05:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
my house oh I'm in Lebanon uh it's the
 
05:20:56.470 --> 05:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
only Red Dot around so uh if I have a
 
05:20:58.548 --> 05:20:58.558 align:start position:0%
constituent or myself who wants to get
 
05:21:00.868 --> 05:21:00.878 align:start position:0%
there well tested to whom do I direct
 
05:21:03.470 --> 05:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
them you can either direct them right to
 
05:21:05.350 --> 05:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
my email information or if you go to
 
05:21:09.190 --> 05:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
this website here pfast des.nh.gov
 
05:21:11.350 --> 05:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
we have a Survey Monkey tool that they
 
05:21:13.270 --> 05:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
can go fill out their information and
 
05:21:15.510 --> 05:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
they can get in line for us to send a
 
05:21:17.788 --> 05:21:17.798 align:start position:0%
sampler out to their house when we do
 
05:21:21.030 --> 05:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
that past test it's a test for I believe
 
05:21:23.750 --> 05:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
27 pasts right now is what the analyte
 
05:21:25.948 --> 05:21:25.958 align:start position:0%
list is covering but we also do the
 
05:21:28.310 --> 05:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
other standard well test for a lot of
 
05:21:29.868 --> 05:21:29.878 align:start position:0%
the other contaminants that a lot of
 
05:21:31.628 --> 05:21:31.638 align:start position:0%
people haven't ever tested for we're
 
05:21:33.390 --> 05:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
learning that way if they need to get
 
05:21:34.910 --> 05:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
some sort of treatment system installed
 
05:21:36.470 --> 05:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
they're not just sort of ambulance
 
05:21:37.830 --> 05:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
chasing the one contaminant they're
 
05:21:39.510 --> 05:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
getting the slew of everything that
 
05:21:40.788 --> 05:21:40.798 align:start position:0%
could be a concern and they get the
 
05:21:42.910 --> 05:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
right technology and there is a rebate
 
05:21:44.670 --> 05:21:44.680 align:start position:0%
program right now that if they are above
 
05:21:47.070 --> 05:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
the state standards they can get up to
 
05:21:49.868 --> 05:21:49.878 align:start position:0%
$5,000 for whole house treatment or if
 
05:21:51.590 --> 05:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's feasible where they're at up to
 
05:21:54.350 --> 05:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
about I believe $10,000 to connect to
 
05:21:54.360 --> 05:22:01.830 align:start position:0%
about I believe $10,000 to connect to
public

05:22:01.830 --> 05:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:05.150 --> 05:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
water okay no other questions I guess oh
 
05:22:07.788 --> 05:22:07.798 align:start position:0%
Lucius parshall has a question all right
 
05:22:09.110 --> 05:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I know know it's getting late
 
05:22:10.830 --> 05:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
the only thing we had left I think was
 
05:22:12.470 --> 05:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
to give an update on the status of the
 
05:22:15.948 --> 05:22:15.958 align:start position:0%
cprg Mike is that right so Mike's going
 
05:22:17.230 --> 05:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
to do that the only thing I'm going to
 
05:22:18.430 --> 05:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
kick it off with and I don't know if
 
05:22:20.110 --> 05:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
Mike's going to cover this but when we
 
05:22:23.110 --> 05:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
applied for this grant funding from EPA
 
05:22:25.190 --> 05:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
the timelines that EPA put on the state
 
05:22:30.430 --> 05:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
agency were unbelievably aggressive and
 
05:22:31.868 --> 05:22:31.878 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to give a shout out to
 
05:22:33.590 --> 05:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
some of my staff while Mike's looking
 
05:22:36.548 --> 05:22:36.558 align:start position:0%
this up uh James Tilly Jen galberth Kurt
 
05:22:39.030 --> 05:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
jingling and Brandon Wayman did an
 
05:22:41.510 --> 05:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
amazing job in meeting these timelines
 
05:22:43.150 --> 05:22:43.160 align:start position:0%
we're not there yet we still have more
 
05:22:44.830 --> 05:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
timelines coming up but Mike's going to
 
05:22:48.030 --> 05:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
cover all that but I felt the need to
 
05:22:49.948 --> 05:22:49.958 align:start position:0%
give a shout out to my staff for for
 
05:22:52.230 --> 05:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
meeting that initial March 1 timeline
 
05:22:54.948 --> 05:22:54.958 align:start position:0%
which was incredibly
 
05:22:57.310 --> 05:22:57.320 align:start position:0%
aggressive so I'm not sure why this is
 
05:22:58.948 --> 05:22:58.958 align:start position:0%
showing the way that it is right now but
 
05:23:02.270 --> 05:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
you also have this in on paper except
 
05:23:07.310 --> 05:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
that oh it oh good okay so um and uh I
 
05:23:10.430 --> 05:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
apologize at 9:00 last Monday night when
 
05:23:12.390 --> 05:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh we were out of our building for some
 
05:23:13.948 --> 05:23:13.958 align:start position:0%
construction and I thought we were
 
05:23:14.948 --> 05:23:14.958 align:start position:0%
supposed to be here for this
 
05:23:17.590 --> 05:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
presentation NE last week uh apparently
 
05:23:21.430 --> 05:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
I couldn't count very well and so uh the
 
05:23:23.788 --> 05:23:23.798 align:start position:0%
uh I think I left off over on the corner
 
05:23:25.910 --> 05:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
here in terms of this this presentation
 
05:23:28.470 --> 05:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
but uh it will be available I'll send it
 
05:23:30.350 --> 05:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
to Christie and there may be some extra
 
05:23:34.750 --> 05:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
copies out there so um so again I'm just
 
05:23:38.430 --> 05:23:38.440 align:start position:0%
going to quickly address the uh cprg as
 
05:23:41.868 --> 05:23:41.878 align:start position:0%
Craig mentioned we received a uh federal
 
05:23:47.150 --> 05:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
government grant um of $3 million to uh
 
05:23:49.070 --> 05:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
produce a what's called a preliminary
 
05:23:51.628 --> 05:23:51.638 align:start position:0%
climate action plan the intent of that
 
05:23:54.110 --> 05:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
plan is to set New Hampshire in a
 
05:23:56.430 --> 05:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
position to where we could apply for
 
05:24:00.150 --> 05:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
approximately $4.6 billion in federal
 
05:24:03.070 --> 05:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
funding a a portion of not just New
 
05:24:07.590 --> 05:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and and uh so the uh
 
05:24:10.110 --> 05:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
requirement was to produce this uh
 
05:24:12.430 --> 05:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
preliminary climate action plan over the
 
05:24:15.030 --> 05:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
course of the Fall we did engagement
 
05:24:17.270 --> 05:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
around the state we got a lot of input
 
05:24:21.470 --> 05:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
from stakeholders we reached out to um
 
05:24:24.788 --> 05:24:24.798 align:start position:0%
uh a wide variety one emphasis of this
 
05:24:27.470 --> 05:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
program is also to provide benefits to
 
05:24:30.430 --> 05:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
what are known as EJ areas um uh
 
05:24:33.030 --> 05:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
lowincome and disadvantaged areas 40% of
 
05:24:35.948 --> 05:24:35.958 align:start position:0%
the benefit um uh needs to go there so
 
05:24:38.830 --> 05:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
we engaged the uh uh
 
05:24:41.548 --> 05:24:41.558 align:start position:0%
lowincome uh community in New Hampshire
 
05:24:44.628 --> 05:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
and um did did a lot of Outreach work
 
05:24:47.470 --> 05:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
presenting this uh held several seminars
 
05:24:50.350 --> 05:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
webinars uh over the fall and winter and
 
05:24:53.628 --> 05:24:53.638 align:start position:0%
we um met that very aggressive timeline
 
05:24:57.708 --> 05:24:57.718 align:start position:0%
of producing the pcap um by March 1st we
 
05:25:01.670 --> 05:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
submitted that um on on March 1st to
 
05:25:04.628 --> 05:25:04.638 align:start position:0%
EPA and uh that put us in a position
 
05:25:08.030 --> 05:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
where we could then apply uh uh April
 
05:25:11.470 --> 05:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
for first uh our application is due for
 
05:25:14.070 --> 05:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
that portion of federal funding that
 
05:25:16.350 --> 05:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
would go uh potentially go to New
 
05:25:18.548 --> 05:25:18.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our intent is to apply for
 
05:25:21.070 --> 05:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
what's known as a a certain tier of that
 
05:25:23.750 --> 05:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
funding which is up to 50 million we're
 
05:25:25.590 --> 05:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
going to apply for that we're also part
 
05:25:29.390 --> 05:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
of Statewide Coalition that uh a number
 
05:25:32.350 --> 05:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
of states uh one Coalition led by Hawaii
 
05:25:35.270 --> 05:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
and 13 other states um is applying for
 
05:25:37.350 --> 05:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
money to be used for resilience for
 
05:25:37.360 --> 05:25:38.750 align:start position:0%
money to be used for resilience for
municipal

05:25:38.750 --> 05:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
05:25:40.590 --> 05:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
uh facilities such as wastewater
 
05:25:42.350 --> 05:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
treatment plants and so on to be able to
 
05:25:44.750 --> 05:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
install solar energy and to be able to
 
05:25:46.548 --> 05:25:46.558 align:start position:0%
at times when the grid is down continue
 
05:25:49.510 --> 05:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
to operate um and then there is a New
 
05:25:51.110 --> 05:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
England Coalition of States that's
 
05:25:53.990 --> 05:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
applying for $500 million the Hawaii one
 
05:25:56.948 --> 05:25:56.958 align:start position:0%
is also 500 million and uh they're
 
05:25:59.470 --> 05:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
applying for a uh a heat pump coalition
 
05:26:02.910 --> 05:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
to uh provide incentives for heat pumps
 
05:26:05.310 --> 05:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
uh to be uh deployed in New England
 
05:26:08.910 --> 05:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
states so we're part of uh those two to
 
05:26:10.990 --> 05:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
multi-state coalitions as well as our
 
05:26:14.070 --> 05:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
own internal State Co um
 
05:26:17.310 --> 05:26:17.320 align:start position:0%
application and um I'm not going to
 
05:26:19.470 --> 05:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time on all the uh
 
05:26:21.190 --> 05:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
components of the plan and so on again
 
05:26:25.110 --> 05:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
I'll provide you with a copy of this
 
05:26:37.230 --> 05:26:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:37.240 --> 05:26:40.590 align:start position:0%
 
can

05:26:40.590 --> 05:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:43.430 --> 05:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
there um again the timeline we we've
 
05:26:46.948 --> 05:26:46.958 align:start position:0%
covered um we we've met everything so
 
05:26:50.670 --> 05:26:50.680 align:start position:0%
far um we're working right now um I
 
05:26:52.190 --> 05:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
don't know how many of you know but the
 
05:26:55.150 --> 05:26:55.160 align:start position:0%
intricacies of developing a 50 million
 
05:26:58.868 --> 05:26:58.878 align:start position:0%
application for federal funding um uh is
 
05:27:01.190 --> 05:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
almost takes almost the 50 million
 
05:27:04.708 --> 05:27:04.718 align:start position:0%
itself to Pro develop the application um
 
05:27:06.628 --> 05:27:06.638 align:start position:0%
but we're we're in the throws of that
 
05:27:09.510 --> 05:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
and uh working EXT extremely hard and I
 
05:27:13.110 --> 05:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
would Echo Craigs um work on the staff
 
05:27:14.788 --> 05:27:14.798 align:start position:0%
we the these people have been working
 
05:27:17.470 --> 05:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
weekends nights and uh doing a
 
05:27:19.910 --> 05:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of work um the key
 
05:27:22.670 --> 05:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
components that we're seeking uh funding
 
05:27:25.190 --> 05:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
for would be Transportation sector
 
05:27:30.270 --> 05:27:30.280 align:start position:0%
measures some EV charging um uh um uh
 
05:27:33.230 --> 05:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
consumer incentives public transit uh
 
05:27:36.190 --> 05:27:36.200 align:start position:0%
expanding public transit uh Residential
 
05:27:37.750 --> 05:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
Building sector there was significant
 
05:27:39.150 --> 05:27:39.160 align:start position:0%
interest and what's known as pre-
 
05:27:40.750 --> 05:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
weatherization and weatherization
 
05:27:44.470 --> 05:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
programs where um pre- weiz is basically
 
05:27:45.868 --> 05:27:45.878 align:start position:0%
before you do weatherization on a
 
05:27:48.910 --> 05:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
building um the building may not be uh
 
05:27:50.750 --> 05:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
in a in a condition so you have to do
 
05:27:52.030 --> 05:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
some work on the structure of the
 
05:27:53.310 --> 05:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
building and so on before you can
 
05:27:55.548 --> 05:27:55.558 align:start position:0%
actually apply installation and do all
 
05:27:57.948 --> 05:27:57.958 align:start position:0%
that so um there's a tremendous need for
 
05:28:01.788 --> 05:28:01.798 align:start position:0%
for that type of those type of programs
 
05:28:04.150 --> 05:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
um local government resilience energy as
 
05:28:05.948 --> 05:28:05.958 align:start position:0%
I mentioned and Energy Efficiency
 
05:28:08.670 --> 05:28:08.680 align:start position:0%
improvements on drinking water um and
 
05:28:10.830 --> 05:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
Water Systems those in addition to
 
05:28:13.230 --> 05:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
reducing emissions they also save money
 
05:28:15.990 --> 05:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
for municipalities on taxes the more
 
05:28:18.310 --> 05:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
efficient the pumps and so on are the
 
05:28:19.868 --> 05:28:19.878 align:start position:0%
less electricity they have to use the
 
05:28:24.310 --> 05:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
less cost um and uh uh there's some also
 
05:28:27.270 --> 05:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
some programs on food waste diversion
 
05:28:29.310 --> 05:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
and also Workforce Development one of
 
05:28:30.788 --> 05:28:30.798 align:start position:0%
the biggest issues that we have in this
 
05:28:34.150 --> 05:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
arena is we need a tremendous amount of
 
05:28:36.350 --> 05:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
of for instance weatherization pre-
 
05:28:38.390 --> 05:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
weatherization work to be done there's
 
05:28:40.270 --> 05:28:40.280 align:start position:0%
not enough contractors to do the work
 
05:28:41.750 --> 05:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
and there's not enough not a trained
 
05:28:43.910 --> 05:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
Workforce so that's a big issue and
 
05:28:45.270 --> 05:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
we're hoping to address that through
 
05:28:48.230 --> 05:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
some of this funding as well um the
 
05:28:51.030 --> 05:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
timeline coming up is is uh in July we
 
05:28:53.390 --> 05:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
anticipate being notified by EPA again
 
05:28:55.470 --> 05:28:55.480 align:start position:0%
there was 4.6 billion I'm sure there'll
 
05:28:57.830 --> 05:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
be about a hundred billion dollar in
 
05:29:00.590 --> 05:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
requests from States so how that gets
 
05:29:03.270 --> 05:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
allocated and the way they the decisions
 
05:29:06.190 --> 05:29:06.200 align:start position:0%
they make there um we don't know but um
 
05:29:08.590 --> 05:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
we anticipate Awards being
 
05:29:12.150 --> 05:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh issued in October and uh this uh
 
05:29:14.150 --> 05:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
funding also requires us to produce
 
05:29:15.670 --> 05:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
what's known as a comprehensive climate
 
05:29:17.868 --> 05:29:17.878 align:start position:0%
action plan which is a followup to the
 
05:29:22.948 --> 05:29:22.958 align:start position:0%
pcap and uh uh further some of this work
 
05:29:25.788 --> 05:29:25.798 align:start position:0%
but also to implement the uh whatever
 
05:29:29.190 --> 05:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
funding we do receive and we anticipate
 
05:29:32.990 --> 05:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
um of of good we we we have high hopes
 
05:29:34.510 --> 05:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
for the two coalitions that were
 
05:29:36.310 --> 05:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
involved in to receive those fundings
 
05:29:39.150 --> 05:29:39.160 align:start position:0%
and again those are 500 $ 10000 million
 
05:29:41.548 --> 05:29:41.558 align:start position:0%
program so you know we would hope to
 
05:29:45.190 --> 05:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
receive maybe 5 or 10% of that um so the
 
05:29:46.430 --> 05:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
potential for funding through the
 
05:29:48.390 --> 05:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
coalitions is probably greater than our
 
05:29:51.150 --> 05:29:51.160 align:start position:0%
our internal State application potential
 
05:29:53.990 --> 05:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
but again that's all up to EPA we don't
 
05:29:58.750 --> 05:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have any um any say over that
 
05:30:01.110 --> 05:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
and um again this is the broad
 
05:30:03.310 --> 05:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
objectives of the cprg program and
 
05:30:05.310 --> 05:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
that's where we are right now so I'd be
 
05:30:08.150 --> 05:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
happy to uh to take questions and end
 
05:30:14.590 --> 05:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
pain uh as uh as we've represent with a
 
05:30:17.868 --> 05:30:17.878 align:start position:0%
lot representative Kaplan has a question
 
05:30:19.948 --> 05:30:19.958 align:start position:0%
yeah I just first of all I want to
 
05:30:21.910 --> 05:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
Salute Your department and and you know
 
05:30:23.350 --> 05:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
congratulate you on meeting that
 
05:30:25.510 --> 05:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
timeline it was as you say it must have
 
05:30:26.990 --> 05:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
been a tremendous effort it's it's taken
 
05:30:29.548 --> 05:30:29.558 align:start position:0%
a pound of flesh out of a lot of people
 
05:30:32.190 --> 05:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
I bet um I just had a question about the
 
05:30:34.430 --> 05:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
public transport I mean you mentioned
 
05:30:36.390 --> 05:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
one of the goals is to expand public
 
05:30:39.190 --> 05:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
transport in state and since we have you
 
05:30:41.390 --> 05:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
know practically zero public transport
 
05:30:42.670 --> 05:30:42.680 align:start position:0%
in the state what would where would you
 
05:30:45.430 --> 05:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
know like what how how ambitious is that
 
05:30:48.670 --> 05:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
plan um it's ambitious but it's also a
 
05:30:50.990 --> 05:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
relatively smaller part of the funding
 
05:30:53.430 --> 05:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
um amount that we we would apply for um
 
05:30:55.110 --> 05:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
we've talked with bus companies here in
 
05:30:58.830 --> 05:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
the state and uh uh Regional Transit um
 
05:31:02.350 --> 05:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
providers Manchester Transit Etc so um
 
05:31:04.990 --> 05:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
if we were to again we're applying for
 
05:31:08.510 --> 05:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
$50 million if EPA gives us 20
 
05:31:10.150 --> 05:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to have to reall
 
05:31:11.910 --> 05:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
decide how how we're going to allocate
 
05:31:14.110 --> 05:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
that and so on we don't we don't know
 
05:31:18.230 --> 05:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
that um and so uh again once the once
 
05:31:21.590 --> 05:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
the awards are announced um but it would
 
05:31:24.310 --> 05:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
go to people like MTA nationa Transit
 
05:31:27.070 --> 05:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
Etc to expand their uh Transit
 
05:31:28.390 --> 05:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities and particularly in
 
05:31:31.868 --> 05:31:31.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:33.750 --> 05:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
areas just to follow up you're not
 
05:31:36.110 --> 05:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
talking about a Statewide network of of
 
05:31:38.110 --> 05:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
any sort at this point no no we're
 
05:31:40.670 --> 05:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
talking about enhancing existing
 
05:31:43.390 --> 05:31:43.400 align:start position:0%
programs yeah yeah yeah and I mean there
 
05:31:45.510 --> 05:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
may be some for smaller Transit
 
05:31:49.190 --> 05:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
operators that that you know do local in
 
05:31:51.070 --> 05:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
in in other areas and so on WE we've
 
05:31:53.150 --> 05:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
been talking with with a wide variety
 
05:31:54.750 --> 05:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
but again it's all dependent on how much
 
05:31:54.760 --> 05:31:59.548 align:start position:0%
but again it's all dependent on how much
we

05:31:59.548 --> 05:31:59.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:02.350 --> 05:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
