on ways and means
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
and we have to discuss
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
what we want to do with five interim
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
study bills
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
and some study bills at house bill 504
 
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.949 align:start position:0%
and some study bills at house bill 504

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
we can make one or two
 
00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:24.310 align:start position:0%
we can make one or two
choices

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
choices
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
after we listen to discussion we can
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
not to consider for future legislation
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
or recommend future legislation or not
 
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.550 align:start position:0%
or recommend future legislation or not
recommend

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
those are only only two choices so we're
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
going to start off with
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
house bill 504
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
which is the has to do with education
 
00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:52.310 align:start position:0%
which is the has to do with education
funding

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
is that on yeah it is
 
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.110 align:start position:0%
is that on yeah it is
um

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
so yes we we're here to
 
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.630 align:start position:0%
so yes we we're here to
um

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
decide what to do with what
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation to put forward on house
 
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
i handed i i
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
took around
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
two pieces of uh
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
two two items one is a
 
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
document that you've seen before when we
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
decided to go as a committee to go into
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
interim study this was a document that
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
identify what was in the bill
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
the second piece of the second article
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
uh is uh
 
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
is just two pages it's an excerpt only
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
from a complaint that was filed
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
i think it was late this summer
 
00:11:58.630 --> 00:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
called rand v v the state of new
 
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire i'll say a few words about
 
00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:01.519 align:start position:0%
that in a moment
 
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
but what i wanted to to say this is all
 
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
very brief because uh
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
the core elements of this bill
 
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.470 align:start position:0%
the core elements of this bill
are

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
what i want to focus on
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
and the first is
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
relates to what
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
it is not and what it does not do
 
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.670 align:start position:0%
it is not and what it does not do
it

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
it does not do away with swept
 
00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:33.519 align:start position:0%
it leaves the tax in place
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's uh one fundamental point
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
the tax rate is unaffected by this bill
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
whatever the tax rate may be is a
 
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
product of how much money
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
the state determines should be
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
raised by the tax and currently
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
in this year it's about 263 million
 
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh starting fiscal year the next fiscal
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
year it will
 
00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.269 align:start position:0%
year it will
be

00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
363 million dollars
 
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
and then the rate uh that
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
is needed to produce that amount of
 
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
money is determined by dra
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
for my community
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
it plays out to a dollar and 87 cents
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh it differs from community to
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
community because of the process of
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
equalization of
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
assessed values
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
so it does not do away with swept but it
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
does respond to a constitutional
 
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.990 align:start position:0%
does respond to a constitutional
challenge

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
that many people are fearful will be
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
brought it has been brought
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
in this complaint in fact and i will uh
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
go to that in a sec
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
the uh the bill itself requires that all
 
00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
revenues produced by this tax
 
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:53.200 align:start position:0%
are sent forward by the
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
collecting agencies the municipalities
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
to the state for deposit in the
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
education fund
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
except for a an amount that may be
 
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.629 align:start position:0%
except for a an amount that may be
retained

00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
retained
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
by the municipalities to cover
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
essentially the costs of collection and
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
to encourage
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
outreach to
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
make the
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
rebate program for
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
for poor taxpayer taxpayers that have
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
limited resources
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
more effective
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
so it has
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
both that
 
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
element of all revenues go to the state
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
and then the second element allowing for
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
a retention of a small amount to cover
 
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.030 align:start position:0%
a retention of a small amount to cover
costs

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
of collection and
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
as an incentive
 
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
for the rebate program
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
and then thirdly most of central
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
importance it greatly enlarges
 
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:51.750 align:start position:0%
importance it greatly enlarges
the

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
low and moderate income homeowners
 
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.790 align:start position:0%
low and moderate income homeowners
income

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
income
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh property tax relief program
 
00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.710 align:start position:0%
uh property tax relief program
and

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
the most significant aspect of what's in
 
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
this bill is that it extends
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
the rebate to the school tax
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
as well as to the statewide property tax
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
once it does that that's as a big jump
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
in what
 
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
the relief will amount to
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
in my community
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
the school rate is about about twelve
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
dollars per thousand
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
and you add that to that the state
 
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
property tax rate 1.73
 
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
and you apply that to what in this bill
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
will become the uh
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
the top uh assessed value that can be
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
subject to the re relief which
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
in this bill is 220 000
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
and you get a fair amount of money
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
the bill caps what can be rebated at 1
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
dollars right now
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
and it also caps the total amount that
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
can be rebated across this
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
state at 25 million dollars
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
um both of those figures of course could
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
and there's the other last of the core
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
elements of this bill that i wanted to
 
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.829 align:start position:0%
elements of this bill that i wanted to
highlight

00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
highlight
 
00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
it sets up a study
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
to explore ways of extending the
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
taxpayer relief
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
to tenants to renters
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
as it stands right now it's for
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
homeowners and we all know that tenants
 
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh through their rent are paying
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
significantly making significant
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
payments as a result of high property
 
00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:42.550 align:start position:0%
payments as a result of high property
taxes

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
and so back to uh this handout the
 
00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:47.030 align:start position:0%
and so back to uh this handout the
complaint

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
this was filed this summer it relates to
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
the larger issue of
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
fairness in school funding
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
referred to as the rand
 
00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.629 align:start position:0%
referred to as the rand
case

00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
rand v state of new hampshire
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
if you look on the
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
second page which is really the ninth
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
page of the complaint
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
there is a section five
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
uh headline the current education
 
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:16.839 align:start position:0%
property tax system is
 
00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:18.390 align:start position:0%
property tax system is
unconstitutional

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
and it goes through i'm not going to go
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
through the details of it but basically
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's that there's a rebate essentially
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
the current tax is allowed to sit
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh as collected in the community in
 
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
which it's collected regardless of what
 
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.230 align:start position:0%
which it's collected regardless of what
the

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
adequacy education
 
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
costs may be and for many
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
i won't say many for a significant
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
number of property wealthy
 
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
towns that means that they keep
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
more than they need for adequacy and
 
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
it's that aspect of
 
00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.909 align:start position:0%
it's that aspect of
disproportionate

00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
disproportionate
 
00:17:53.919 --> 00:17:55.350 align:start position:0%

that

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
triggers the constitutional concerns
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
which to this committee were raised in
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
the first instance by
 
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
william william artinger
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
a expert in tax matters that who's well
 
00:18:09.679 --> 00:18:11.430 align:start position:0%
a expert in tax matters that who's well
known

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
known
 
00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.310 align:start position:0%
known
and

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:14.799 align:start position:0%
he submitted a letter which should be in
 
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
the record of this
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
this legislation
um

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:19.570 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:20.950 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.070 align:start position:0%
[Music]
stating

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
stating
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
in forceful terms his opinion
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
that this tax because of this
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
disproportional aspect of
 
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.669 align:start position:0%
disproportional aspect of
retention

00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
retention
 
00:18:31.679 --> 00:18:32.750 align:start position:0%
retention
is

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.630 align:start position:0%
is
unconstitutional

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.590 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
so

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.470 align:start position:0%
so
this

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
house bill 504 seeks to correct that
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
so i think what i want to say and sum up
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
this is a matter that i think
 
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.590 align:start position:0%
this is a matter that i think
indisputably

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
indisputably
 
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
requires further legislation exactly
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
what that legislation would be
 
00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.350 align:start position:0%
what that legislation would be
uh

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
would be to be determined it's not the
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
purpose of
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
an interim study to
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
come down hard on one side or another of
 
00:19:01.919 --> 00:19:03.029 align:start position:0%
come down hard on one side or another of
what

00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:03.039 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
will be done but
 
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.710 align:start position:0%
will be done but
but

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
this this question of constitutionality
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
the sufficiency of the taxpayer relief
 
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
program and the opportunity that swept
 
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
presents for a
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
broader tax relief program applying to
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
all the property taxpayers regardless of
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
it's the state tax or the
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
municipal or school tax
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
local school tax
 
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
this kind of relief is desperately
 
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
needed we all know that
 
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
and uh future legislation can address
 
00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.310 align:start position:0%
and uh future legislation can address
this

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
in a way that seems uh most suitable to
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
whoever files i expect that i would file
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
if i'm re-elected of course
 
00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.190 align:start position:0%
if i'm re-elected of course
um

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
and uh seek something similar to what
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
you have in front of you but it might
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
not be exactly the same so i hope that
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
uh for all of these reasons um
 
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
that we can agree that uh further
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
legislation is needed and
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
this subject and
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
go forward with that thank you
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comprehensive
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
analysis of this legislation
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
representative ames
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
and you bring up a point that i've
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
always agreed on
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
is the statewide education property tax
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
should have been delivered directly to
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
and not retained locally
 
00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.470 align:start position:0%
and not retained locally
and

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
then i would knew what it was supposed
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.310 align:start position:0%
to do
okay

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
further questions or comments
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
representing early
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
directed to representative ames
 
00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.510 align:start position:0%
directed to representative ames
um

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
i was
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
generally under the impression
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
that the equitable and proportional
 
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.390 align:start position:0%
that the equitable and proportional
section

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
of tax law applied to the application of
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
the tax
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
not the distribution of the tax just for
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
my own education could you address that
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.630 align:start position:0%
 
represents

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
represents
 
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
not sure i can do that distinction that
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
way but the uh
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
tax as it's applied and in truth is
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
every every taxpayer is going to pay a
 
00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.350 align:start position:0%
every every taxpayer is going to pay a
dollar

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
and something
 
00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.590 align:start position:0%
and something
um

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
used to be two dollars and something but
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
because of inflation and property values
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's gone down and it's the constant
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
amount to be collected has stayed the
 
00:21:36.159 --> 00:21:37.350 align:start position:0%
amount to be collected has stayed the
same

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:37.790 align:start position:0%
same
um

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.270 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.590 align:start position:0%
and then um
the

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
i believe there's some supreme court
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
language also to this effect
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.190 align:start position:0%
that um
if

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
the collected amount is then turned back
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
into the community so into one community
 
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
but not all
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
in a disproportionate way
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
so that in fact the taxpayers
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
in that community
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
that get back some of the state money
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
that's been collected
 
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
because that's what it is is state money
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
is not the localities money
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
if it comes back
 
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.310 align:start position:0%
if it comes back
to

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
effectively reduce the rate
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
that the property taxpayer is paying and
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
you know you and i can go back and forth
 
00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.350 align:start position:0%
you know you and i can go back and forth
on

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
application versus rebate or whatever
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
and uh so what you know it's the court
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately that we'll figure this out
 
00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
and uh i think everybody including
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
such an expert as mr
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
artinger backs off in terms of absolutes
 
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.510 align:start position:0%
artinger backs off in terms of absolutes
and

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
recognizes that uh you know the final
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
call is going to be by the group of
 
00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
represent you early and yes i think
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
you're correct on that and uh
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
because what it'll do is provide us if
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
this case goes forward and if it rules
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
the way that it looks like it probably
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
should rule it would give both this
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
committee the its sister committee in
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
the in the senate and dra guidance
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
regarding both
 
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
the taking of the tax and the
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
distribution of the tax and take that
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
equitable proportional
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
phraseology and apply it to both which i
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
think is an important uh thing that in
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
today's society needs to be done thank
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
you sir thank you and i agree with that
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh we often agree don't we
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
for representative romney
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i got a question a question for uh
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
brooks and vaynes
 
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.830 align:start position:0%
brooks and vaynes
um

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
what's your sense in terms of the speed
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
of this case
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
i guess they have to i know things don't
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
move very quickly
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm just trying to get a sense of
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
you know i guess some of the judgments
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
of the of the court are going to be
 
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
taken into consideration
 
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
in our work i i'm not object i have no
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
objection to
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
to moving this
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
forward as a yes
 
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
for future legislation because i think
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
there's components as representative
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
major said that are i think i think we
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
can all agree on
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
i mean some of the details in this
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
current bill we may not agree on but i
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
think there's some things that we can we
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
can come together on
 
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.669 align:start position:0%
can come together on
so

00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
any sense if the case is going to give
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
this a priority or not or
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
you may not know
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
well i think that it's a it's the
 
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
question we all ask and wonder about and
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh there is a second school funding case
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
as you know
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh that began with the convale conval
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
school district complaining about the
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
inadequacy of the adequacy
 
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
grants that they're receiving and
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
and that was filed what a couple of
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
years ago i'm guessing
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
and life goes on and
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
and they're still in discovery and uh
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
now the second case has come along and
 
00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.830 align:start position:0%
now the second case has come along and
uh

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
whether that will slow things down or
 
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
speed things up i don't know
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
um i think it's going to be uh
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
i don't even want to venture i guess you
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
know i'm sorry but uh it's going to be a
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
while i kind of thought that would be
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
the answer but i just couldn't just ask
 
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
him the question thank you
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
for other questions or comments i'm
 
00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.909 align:start position:0%
for other questions or comments i'm
representing

00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
thank you on i just wanted to provide a
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
little bit of um bill court history on
 
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.149 align:start position:0%
little bit of um bill court history on
this

00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
on which you know uh
 
00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.310 align:start position:0%
on which you know uh
that

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.350 align:start position:0%
that
the

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
we spent a number of years
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
after the first
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
on education funding task force that we
 
00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:54.799 align:start position:0%
were both on
 
00:25:54.799 --> 00:25:55.750 align:start position:0%
were both on
on

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature did
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
make the system that we'd
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
been stuck with work
 
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.070 align:start position:0%
been stuck with work
and

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.269 align:start position:0%
and
on

00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.269 align:start position:0%
 
we

00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
changed the formula
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
and the procedures and
 
00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.230 align:start position:0%
and the procedures and
the

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
supreme court for the first time
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
agreed that we had done enough
 
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
and that they were removing the strict
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
scrutiny that they'd put on us
 
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.230 align:start position:0%
scrutiny that they'd put on us
on

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
that was changed mostly from the
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
initiative of the senate
 
00:26:45.919 --> 00:26:47.510 align:start position:0%
initiative of the senate
to

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.630 align:start position:0%
to
undo

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
undo
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
a number of those things one of them was
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
to make
 
00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
the amount in the statewide property tax
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
363 million forever
 
00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.750 align:start position:0%
363 million forever
um

00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.870 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
was to
 
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.190 align:start position:0%
was to
allow

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
the uh donor communities as they were
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
called and are still calling themselves
 
00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.430 align:start position:0%
called and are still calling themselves
sometimes

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
on to retain
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
the excess property tax that was raised
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
by this fairly small amount by the way
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
when we started it was
 
00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.510 align:start position:0%
when we started it was
six

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh thousand
 
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.549 align:start position:0%
uh thousand
dollar

00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
six hundred and six point six percent oh
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
six six dollars and sixty cents per
 
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.190 align:start position:0%
six six dollars and sixty cents per
thousand

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh and it rapidly went down to i think
 
00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.510 align:start position:0%
uh and it rapidly went down to i think
four

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh something like that and then
 
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
decreased again in in eleven
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
the only way because they dismiss
 
00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
strict scrutiny the only way that that
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
this could be challenged again was to
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
start from something like this and
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
something like convol
 
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
and go back through the courts and the
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
courts can
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
delay things as they will depending on
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
uh have done so i think in the convol
 
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
case um but
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh it was
 
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.350 align:start position:0%
uh it was
in

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
1996 december i believe after the
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
election that
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
we were
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
told by the supreme court that we had to
 
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:38.799 align:start position:0%
solve this now
 
00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:39.990 align:start position:0%
solve this now
and

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
or maybe it was 98 98 98 yes
 
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
we came in as second termer's first time
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
on the finance committee and they had to
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
put together a task force
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
and speaker scitec
 
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.310 align:start position:0%
and speaker scitec
uh

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
did a very brave
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
thing and uh opened up at that point in
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
late december
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
she opened up
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
the bill filings to allow anybody to put
 
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
in anything that they thought would
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
sufficient amount of money
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
to fund this we had a 1 billion a year
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
budget at that point for the general
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
fund there was no education trust fund
 
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
when we finished scraping away at
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
anything that might possibly not be
 
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.190 align:start position:0%
anything that might possibly not be
relevant

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
we were at 800 million
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
that we had to add
 
00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
to the state budget so that gives you an
 
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
idea of
 
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
the huge jump that the courts required
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
and that the legislature decided it had
 
00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
to react to
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm telling you all this because
 
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.230 align:start position:0%
and i'm telling you all this because
nobody

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
nobody
 
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
tried to file and go through the long
 
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
case until a few years ago and
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
we may find ourselves this december
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh faced with the same conundrum whoever
 
00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:19.039 align:start position:0%
is in charge whoever however many of us
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
are back
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's going to be interesting and we
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
will need vehicles
 
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
and so i definitely support this because
 
00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.149 align:start position:0%
and so i definitely support this because
it's

00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
vehicle that can be used by whoever
 
00:30:37.279 --> 00:30:38.630 align:start position:0%
vehicle that can be used by whoever
is

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
trying to deal with the court
 
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.430 align:start position:0%
trying to deal with the court
requirements

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
just to add a little bit of history to
 
00:30:46.159 --> 00:30:47.350 align:start position:0%
just to add a little bit of history to
this

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
in 1998
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
when representing alani and i were in
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
our second term
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
were both on finance
 
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
and at that time finance and ways and
 
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
mains was together
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
and there was normally three divisions
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
as there is now
 
00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:05.909 align:start position:0%
as there is now
and

00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:05.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
the speaker
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
formed a fourth division
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
which represented army and i were put on
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
to solve
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
the education funding thing
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
and we worked
 
00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
every day
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
sundays etc for a long time and we came
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
up with this
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
six six weeks six and a half days a week
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
yep he gave a sunday morning off
 
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.029 align:start position:0%
yep he gave a sunday morning off
yes

00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
i got a bad back
 
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
well we got it done
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
and it still works today
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh any other comments
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative spellsbury thank you mr
 
00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.549 align:start position:0%
representative spellsbury thank you mr
chairman

00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:31:52.559 --> 00:31:53.830 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
yes i also support having legislation on
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
this tangled subject before the
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
committee during the coming term
 
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
one thing that i wonder though
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
in the complaint
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
on page nine that second page
 
00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.750 align:start position:0%
on page nine that second page
paragraph

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
29 says
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
it says
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
of the action that this legislature took
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
to reduce the swept collections by 100
 
00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.830 align:start position:0%
to reduce the swept collections by 100
million

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
it says this temporarily eliminated the
 
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
surplus swept revenues that property
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
wealthy towns have previously failed to
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
send to the state
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
and instead of kept for themselves so i
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
think it's an interesting thing to note
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
while that doesn't address all that this
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
bill is concerned with
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
an incidental effect you could say
 
00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.509 align:start position:0%
an incidental effect you could say
benefit

00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
of the 100 million dollar reduction
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
was that it effectively
 
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.190 align:start position:0%
was that it effectively
suspended

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
suspended
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
i may just
 
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:03.750 align:start position:0%
i may just
represent

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
ames just to note that
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
that change was accompanied with a grant
 
00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559 align:start position:0%
to the property wealthy
 
00:33:12.559 --> 00:33:14.070 align:start position:0%
to the property wealthy
communities

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.669 align:start position:0%
communities
that

00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
was fashioned as a hold harmless that
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
essentially made up
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
for what they could no longer retain
 
00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:27.909 align:start position:0%
for what they could no longer retain
so

00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
further questions or comments on house
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
send none
 
00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:38.470 align:start position:0%
send none
representative

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
i guess we're all we're the senses that
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
we're we're probably going to move
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
forward with
 
00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.149 align:start position:0%
forward with
something

00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
so what's the plan i mean this is a big
 
00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:49.190 align:start position:0%
so what's the plan i mean this is a big
topic

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
topic
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
i mean is it going to be a handful of
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
people getting in a room coming up with
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
a bill
 
00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.789 align:start position:0%
a bill
or

00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
i guess you could file a bill
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
i mean i
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
you know i'm big on commissions and we
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
probably had a million commissions on
 
00:34:03.519 --> 00:34:04.310 align:start position:0%
probably had a million commissions on
this

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
if i don't know how many commissions
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
we've had on this topic
 
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know either the most uh recent
 
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
i'll start over i i don't know uh how
 
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
many there have been
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
in my time
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
most recently and i sat on this one was
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
uh the commission on
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
school funding
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
that ended its work in late 2020
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
before that there was one that
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
representative umberger chaired
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
there was a committee not a commission
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
and uh that uh did its work uh one or
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
two years before the maybe one or one
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
year before the startup of the
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
commission that i just spoke of
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
and uh back in uh 2009
 
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
or s or eight probably eight um
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
there was a uh
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
a committee that did uh groundbreaking
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
work on this uh this effort um and uh
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
that was a
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh that was a legislative committee as
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
well a joint committee um
 
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
and uh it's the product of their work
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
that carried forward through the years
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
in the form of a state stabilization
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
grant after much of the language of the
 
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
of uh of their changes had been cleaned
 
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
out um
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
there was this consensus that uh
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
that the funding
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
needed to be carried forward and so a
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
stabilization grant was devised that
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
essentially did that
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
with a
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
shrinking aspect to it four percent per
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
year but then that
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
in recent years was taken away so it's
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's a mishmash of uh things
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
that we've got here that are the product
 
00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.870 align:start position:0%
that we've got here that are the product
of

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
of joint work you write about that and
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
uh people getting together and trying to
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
figure out what to do in a
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
on a matter that seems to defy solution
 
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
how we how we proceed with this and i
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
think the traditional way is that
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
legislators go back
 
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
at this stage in the you know in the
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
year go back and
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
someone comes forward with a bill that
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
may be the product of behind the scenes
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
work with others or may not be
 
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't know what to suggest
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
here i i will go back i
 
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
glad to confer with whoever wants to
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
confer with me
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
um in an informal process
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative romney yeah i i
 
00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
this this would be a major bill
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
it'd be great if it could be a
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill
 
00:36:55.839 --> 00:36:57.430 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill
um

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
that i worked on just says
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
these two did in
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
2000 and what was that 1998 all right
 
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.510 align:start position:0%
2000 and what was that 1998 all right
so

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh but i know i understand i mean we
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
don't really have time to do that
 
00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.510 align:start position:0%
don't really have time to do that
um

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
i i don't know i just it just seems like
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
we're gonna do a bill
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
the bill may be it's up to the committee
 
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
you know how we're all in a rush
 
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know with our bills three months
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
we have to work on a bill
 
00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.109 align:start position:0%
we have to work on a bill
uh

00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
you know but if it's the first term
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
build and then there's
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
the bill can be retained and continue to
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
be worked on uh i would imagine that way
 
00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.589 align:start position:0%
be worked on uh i would imagine that way
um

00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
assuming that that we can't get
 
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
agreement and uh you know
 
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
but all right now that's my thoughts
 
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
that's all if i may just add one thing
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
to uh there is uh actually is today at
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
10 30 uh the education committee is
 
00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.670 align:start position:0%
10 30 uh the education committee is
coming

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
coming
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
into a meeting to
 
00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.270 align:start position:0%
into a meeting to
to

00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
do its work on an interim study of house
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
bill 1680
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
which is a comprehension effort to make
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive reform of the school
 
00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.069 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive reform of the school
funding

00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
system included in that bill actually as
 
00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:13.910 align:start position:0%
system included in that bill actually as
the

00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
other provisions of house bill 504 as a
 
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
subset of the larger bill
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be discussed in
 
00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
detail at uh at this education committee
 
00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.510 align:start position:0%
detail at uh at this education committee
meeting

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.310 align:start position:0%
meeting
uh

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
so there's this other aspect of it it's
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
a part of a much bigger picture and
 
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
packages absolutely thank you
 
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
representative aaron
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
so my predecessor for sullivan county
 
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
district 7 representative
 
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
jim grenier was on that education
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
committee that
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
examined school funding back in 19
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.030 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
i wonder so what happened with the
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
results from that and the
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations from that committee did
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
anybody do anything with it do you know
 
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:14.230 align:start position:0%
anybody do anything with it do you know
anybody

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
you know i i i don't remember
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
specifically i think the worst uh
 
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
for one thing representative umberger
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
didn't return um in in the next
 
00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.109 align:start position:0%
didn't return um in in the next
legislature

00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
so she wasn't here to you know shepherd
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
the results of the commission there were
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
parts of it i think that made their way
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
into uh legislation you could ask the
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
education committee representatives who
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
are here if you
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
want a better answer than i can provide
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
but maybe that's a detour that the chair
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions or comments
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
thank you on
 
00:40:03.119 --> 00:40:04.150 align:start position:0%
thank you on
this

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
what is what gets done is going to
 
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
on scitec shaped
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
the original agreement
 
00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:15.750 align:start position:0%
the original agreement
on

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:16.550 align:start position:0%
on
if

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
and we don't we won't know
 
00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.630 align:start position:0%
and we don't we won't know
on

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
what has to be done if they decide
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
not until the supreme court
 
00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.230 align:start position:0%
not until the supreme court
uh

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
makes a decision
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
for us
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
and in the meantime we could be doing
 
00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
one thing and the supreme court would
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
decide it was still
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
improper and that would take a number of
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
years more to figure out um
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
we had it was not easy the first time we
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
on while we were meeting they
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
put out the sales tax and the income tax
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
bills that were
 
00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.670 align:start position:0%
bills that were
on

00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
the income tax bill in particular would
 
00:41:02.079 --> 00:41:02.790 align:start position:0%
the income tax bill in particular would
have

00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
solved this but the governor as well as
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of people in the state did not
 
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
want it
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
uh and that one
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
eventually uh failed because of that
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
on and meanwhile we were still working
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
as i remember
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
and we came up with something that got
 
00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
called the poo poo plan
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
a bit of all sorts of things it took uh
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
eight hours of debate i think it was
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
after midnight when we finished
 
00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.430 align:start position:0%
after midnight when we finished
finally

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
finally
 
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
things got taken out they got put back
 
00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.190 align:start position:0%
things got taken out they got put back
again

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.069 align:start position:0%
again
on

00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
and we finally passed that and then over
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
succeeding years there were was more
 
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
work done on it
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
we have to be
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
prepared if the court actually produces
 
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
a decision which doesn't say
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
what you're doing is fine
 
00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.430 align:start position:0%
what you're doing is fine
then

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.309 align:start position:0%
then
on

00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
on that it's not going to be
 
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
one bill and quick
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
what i've heard here this morning
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
a bill is really needed
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
work really needs to be done
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
we want that we
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
put forth
 
00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:26.079 align:start position:0%
let me so i
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
made it right
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
we have only two things we can do
 
00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:31.990 align:start position:0%
we have only two things we can do
either

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
not recommend for future legislation or
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
is that an order
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
oh we're not in the executive session
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
what's that i was i was asking if i
 
00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
could make a motion but we're not in the
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
executive session so
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
we could move to government names
 
00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
for a motion
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh to go into executive session to
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
consider second session or you maybe you
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
have to do that
 
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
you have to listen to executive session
 
00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.190 align:start position:0%
you have to listen to executive session
oh

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%

absolutely right
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
that's a session
 
00:46:36.079 --> 00:46:37.430 align:start position:0%
that's a session
right

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
i think there has to be a little blurb
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
and we need to get that report out by
 
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
the 28th of october
 
00:46:59.589 --> 00:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
so so do we leave it that i i will uh
 
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
draft a report and send it to you yes
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:11.829 align:start position:0%
 
that's

00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:47:13.589 --> 00:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
actually reducing the rate of the meals
 
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
and rooms tax and increasing the revenue
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
sharing of meals and rooms tax revenue
 
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions or comments
 
00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.950 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions or comments
from

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.790 align:start position:0%
from
anybody

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.710 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
i said i guess i'll start here
 
00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:41.190 align:start position:0%
i said i guess i'll start here
um

00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
you know we we've reduced a lot of taxes
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
over the last couple years and we're in
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
the middle of reducing the
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax
 
00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
a percent every year going forward
 
00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:55.030 align:start position:0%
a percent every year going forward
um

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
i don't think reducing the
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
moving meals tax
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
as prescribed here
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
is a good idea and then i know they want
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
to redirect
 
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
more of the money to the
 
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.430 align:start position:0%
 
which

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
you know a pretty sizable hit in our on
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
our revenues
 
00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.390 align:start position:0%
our revenues
um

00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
and i think when it comes to
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
you know next year
 
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
we have to take a look at the big
 
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
picture in terms of all our revenues
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
um and i don't think we want to start by
 
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
us suggesting that we want to reduce
 
00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
the meals and rooms tax
 
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
just my general comment so i would be a
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
further questions or comments
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
rubs and elneny
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
thank you on i
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
completely agree
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
i think that next year is a year for
 
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
taking stock of what is going on and
 
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out where we're going
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
to start to be
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
even by the end of of
 
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year we're in never mind the
 
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
next fiscal year what it's going to look
 
00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.150 align:start position:0%
next fiscal year what it's going to look
like

00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
before we make any more
 
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
changes that cost us revenue
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
right and i i agree with you represent
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
elmi the
 
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
changes that we've already passed some
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
of them haven't been fully implemented
 
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
and they are in the process of being
 
00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:39.829 align:start position:0%
and they are in the process of being
implemented

00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
this year next year and the following
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
year and the following year after that
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
one of the big things i worry about is
 
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.710 align:start position:0%
one of the big things i worry about is
that

00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
we in every other state is doing great
 
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
right now with revenues
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
the primary reason for that
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
is all the stimulus checks that went to
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
all the individuals
 
00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.710 align:start position:0%
all the individuals
the

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
opera money that went out the ppp money
 
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:16.069 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
brought in revenue that we hadn't
 
00:50:17.839 --> 00:50:19.990 align:start position:0%
brought in revenue that we hadn't
anticipated

00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
anticipated
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
and that's going to
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
the result of that's going to be going
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
away and we need to wait and see what
 
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
that settles down to
 
00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
because that's going to be settling down
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
the same time as we're continuing to ink
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
to reduce
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
our tax revenues
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
i want to follow up with the
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
representative so yeah i mean the opera
 
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
money's still being spent i mean it's
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
some of our i know some of our state
 
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
opera money hasn't even been obligated
 
00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:54.630 align:start position:0%
opera money hasn't even been obligated
yet

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
it may never be i guess
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
there's money that's still going out the
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
door i know the county in
 
00:51:01.839 --> 00:51:03.349 align:start position:0%
door i know the county in
rockingham

00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
rockingham
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
we got six we got 60 million
 
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
and uh a lot of that's going to go to a
 
00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:10.630 align:start position:0%
and uh a lot of that's going to go to a
new

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
building for
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
some outpatient services and things like
 
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
that and housing some of our agencies
 
00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.230 align:start position:0%
that and housing some of our agencies
but

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:19.510 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
but all that money hasn't been spent
 
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
either so
 
00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:23.829 align:start position:0%
either so
um

00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
i mean that just
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
yeah and and
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh major is correct uh you know we we
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
don't stand alone when i talk to people
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
legislated from other states they're all
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
saying that they're washing money too
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
so there's something's up here
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
that something is gonna eventually we
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
would i know for the last two years
 
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
we've all been waiting for the shoot to
 
00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
shoot a drop the other shooter dropped
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
and we haven't gotten there yet but i
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
think we just have to be cautious it's
 
00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
it's coming yeah
 
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:58.870 --> 00:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
reps indonesian
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to also say that i i agree
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
that we should not move this forward um
 
00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.230 align:start position:0%
that we should not move this forward um
it's

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
each each tax and some of the taxes that
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
we've produced
 
00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:12.790 align:start position:0%
we've produced
um

00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.230 align:start position:0%
um
definitely

00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
we've seen you know for example the
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
business profits tax we've seen over
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
time even prior to
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
is that better yes okay
 
00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
i was just saying so we have seen that
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
some of the other taxes we reduced like
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax and i'm talking
 
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
even before covid
 
00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
did have an increase in business
 
00:52:41.359 --> 00:52:42.390 align:start position:0%
did have an increase in business
activity

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
activity
 
00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:43.910 align:start position:0%
activity
um

00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
this this
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how given the i agree with
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
the concerns that we don't know how much
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
things are going to be affected
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
i don't see this reducing this tax as
 
00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.630 align:start position:0%
i don't see this reducing this tax as
being

00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
a major driver
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
of new business right now so i think
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
it's probably better
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
given the given the amounts here to
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
leave this as it is
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments
 
00:53:12.829 --> 00:53:12.839 align:start position:0%
represents spillsbury thank you mr
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
chairman i thought when we reviewed this
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh bill that it sort of represented an
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
internal conflict or at least a choice
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
on the one hand it proposes to reduce
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
the rate and on the other hand it
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
proposes to share more of what's
 
00:53:27.359 --> 00:53:28.630 align:start position:0%
proposes to share more of what's
collected

00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
collected
 
00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:29.589 align:start position:0%
collected
and

00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
the idea
 
00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:32.309 align:start position:0%
the idea
of

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
increasing the share to the
 
00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:35.910 align:start position:0%
increasing the share to the
municipalities

00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
is very attractive to me
 
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
if we found ourselves in a future
 
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
legislature where the circumstances and
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
the revenue supported that
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
decision i think i would be in favor of
 
00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:47.510 align:start position:0%
decision i think i would be in favor of
it

00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
but i probably wouldn't be reducing the
 
00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
followed by representative brandon
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
thank you on
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
we have to be very careful when we're
 
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
looking at what our
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
tax reduction
 
00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.230 align:start position:0%
tax reduction
on

00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
on policy was that we look also at the
 
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
economic activity that was producing the
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
surge in revenues they don't match up
 
00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.790 align:start position:0%
surge in revenues they don't match up
um

00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
if you
 
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
we have that from the dra
 
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
now that they've got excellent analysts
 
00:54:37.829 --> 00:54:37.839 align:start position:0%
and they've got very good
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
data collection for which we didn't have
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:47.670 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
we don't have any idea yet what the
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
change to single sales factor is going
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
to do to our business tax
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
it could be
 
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
nothing it could be drastic
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
and we won't know
 
00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:04.470 align:start position:0%
and we won't know
until

00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
until
 
00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:05.589 align:start position:0%
until
anything

00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:55:05.599 --> 00:55:06.790 align:start position:0%
anything
until

00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
until
 
00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:09.349 align:start position:0%
until
2024

00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
2024
 
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
about that i think
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
there will be some small indication
 
00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
maybe from
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
analyzing what market-based sourcing did
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
next year
 
00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:20.950 align:start position:0%
next year
but

00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:22.150 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:23.270 align:start position:0%
um
that

00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
gives me the willies
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
the credit carry forward gives our chair
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
the willies
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
huge and
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
can be asked for back
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
and we also we've been assuming that
 
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
there would be more refunds
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
this year than there have been
 
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh from the ppp
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
i think the refunds are up a little
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
but not much
 
00:55:56.069 --> 00:55:56.079 align:start position:0%
um so far
 
00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
on it's i described the credit carry
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
forward situation to
 
00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.990 align:start position:0%
forward situation to
a

00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:56:06.309 --> 00:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
very good accountant and she kind of
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
went white
 
00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:10.309 align:start position:0%
went white
but

00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
so we really
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
and we have the
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
on almost certainly triggering off that
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
recession that hadn't come yet
 
00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.589 align:start position:0%
recession that hadn't come yet
on

00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
by continuing to raise rates to make
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
sure that we don't get into the kind of
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
runaway inflation that i have
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
experienced twice in
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
in my life as
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh once in brazil and once here when i
 
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
was a young professional
 
00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.950 align:start position:0%
was a young professional
and

00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:45.030 align:start position:0%
and
on

00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:45.990 align:start position:0%
on
so

00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
they need fed needs to do what it needs
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
to do but it's on we're not we don't
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
have any good choices
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:55.589 align:start position:0%
on that
so

00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
and we don't know i think one of the
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
things this committee can do next year
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
is to try to get
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
information from lbao on
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
on the finance side of these things what
 
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.190 align:start position:0%
on the finance side of these things what
on

00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.150 align:start position:0%
on
what

00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
sectors of industry in this state have
 
00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:17.829 align:start position:0%
sectors of industry in this state have
been

00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
most affected
 
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
by the stimulus that's gone out
 
00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:24.230 align:start position:0%
by the stimulus that's gone out
and

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
what's happening to them to the extent
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
that we can
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
and that may help with what
 
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative abrami has been
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
about there's still arpa money going out
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
and some other and there's still the
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh ira going out and there's still uh
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
the transportation money going out
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
on it's in specific defined sectors and
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
we don't even know what most of the
 
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
sectors are at this point because it's
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
all being the arpa money's all coming
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
through the governor
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
hb2 correct
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
and it was it was sitting around 21 22
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
percent before that's correct
 
00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:24.069 align:start position:0%
percent before that's correct
so

00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:26.549 --> 00:58:26.559 align:start position:0%
it was a 22 before so
 
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
this budget year based this this budget
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
cycle they did a little part retain
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
stayed it was an increase to 30 percent
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
and then moving to 40 i know that was
 
00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
the original target right going way back
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
but we never got there because every
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
every budget finance committee
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
they always
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
chop it down when we're looking for
 
00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:51.349 align:start position:0%
chop it down when we're looking for
revenues

00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:58:51.359 --> 00:58:52.549 align:start position:0%
revenues
so

00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know if we have to get
 
00:58:55.829 --> 00:58:55.839 align:start position:0%
to the 40
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean because it's one of
 
00:58:59.829 --> 00:58:59.839 align:start position:0%
those things in that
 
00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:01.839 align:start position:0%
we can say anything we want in a bill
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
but when hb2 comes along that can change
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh when they're looking for money
 
00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:08.710 align:start position:0%
uh when they're looking for money
so

00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
um but at the very least for this budget
 
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
for this budget that we're in
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
we know that it's gone up or maybe eight
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
percent to 30 percent for the towns
 
00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
and that hasn't settled in yet so that
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
that will be happening
 
00:59:26.319 --> 00:59:28.549 align:start position:0%
that will be happening
um

00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
corruption aaron
 
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:59:31.839 --> 00:59:32.630 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
so

00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
i heard some ideas floated around uh
 
00:59:38.309 --> 00:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
first first of all question about
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh funds that are collected from this
 
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
how much of it goes to our travel and
 
00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:45.990 align:start position:0%
how much of it goes to our travel and
tourism

00:59:45.990 --> 00:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
tourism
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
agency or department in the state is
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
there a portion of this
 
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
that is allocated or is that just done
 
00:59:54.069 --> 00:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
through the budget the state budget
 
00:59:54.079 --> 01:00:18.950 align:start position:0%
through the budget the state budget
process

01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
do you have anything to add to that
 
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
that's right okay
 
01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
something on there is money allocated
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
each year
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
for the advertising budget it used to be
 
01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
very small
 
01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:33.829 align:start position:0%
very small
we

01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
increased it uh
 
01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.549 align:start position:0%
increased it uh
in

01:00:37.549 --> 01:00:37.559 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:00:37.559 --> 01:00:39.510 align:start position:0%
in
2007

01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
2007
 
01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:40.630 align:start position:0%
2007
on

01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
and ever since then until we hit this
 
01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
very sharp recession with covet
 
01:00:47.119 --> 01:00:48.230 align:start position:0%
very sharp recession with covet
on

01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.270 align:start position:0%
on
on

01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals it's been going up about
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
five percent a year
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
which i thought and we all thought and
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
finance thought was a very good return
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
on investment
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
and it was reduced a lot in 11
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
12 but i think just for one year
 
01:01:08.309 --> 01:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
and then they
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
put it back up again
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
the reason i'm asking is because there
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
was someone who suggested to me
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
that they wanted to take
 
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
some portion of what we collect in rooms
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
and meals tax
 
01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:28.150 align:start position:0%
and meals tax
and

01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
i know that the
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
travel and tourism department does
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
mostly marketing stuff
 
01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
but there's no real
 
01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:37.990 align:start position:0%
but there's no real
development

01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.109 align:start position:0%
development
happening

01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
for tourism in any of our counties and
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
except i know in sullivan county we have
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
a sugar river development council
 
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
that is uh working on
 
01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.789 align:start position:0%
that is uh working on
developing

01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
developing
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
tourism in in our in our in our county
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
and so they're looking for ways in which
 
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
to fund that effort
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
and and so i i don't know if you've
 
01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
heard of any kind of other
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
uh initiatives that are trying to tap
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
into rooms and meals tax
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
i i'm not sure but that would be a
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
question for the appropriators and the
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
finance committee can make the decision
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.630 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
okay there there is actually a
 
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
fairly large initiative being put on by
 
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
taylor caswell's
 
01:02:41.599 --> 01:02:42.950 align:start position:0%
taylor caswell's
development

01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.109 align:start position:0%
development
um

01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
agency whose new name i never can
 
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
remember the former dread right now
 
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
now two agencies and there is actually a
 
01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
statewide initiative
 
01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.549 align:start position:0%
statewide initiative
the

01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
executive council has approved a
 
01:02:58.319 --> 01:02:59.510 align:start position:0%
executive council has approved a
contract

01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
contract
 
01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
with an agency that's outside group
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
that's been employed to
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
see what we can do to
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
broaden and strengthen
 
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
our outdoor recreation in the state of
 
01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and it's
 
01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
just getting off the ground
 
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:18.789 align:start position:0%
just getting off the ground
uh

01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be much more
 
01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
regularized standardized and expanded
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
so i think we all need to keep an eye on
 
01:03:29.029 --> 01:03:29.039 align:start position:0%
that some people want to keep things
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
quite local others are keen to
 
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
make it more statewide i think that's
 
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
being decided in the next year or two
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
taylor caswell's taking an initiative in
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
this area it's backed by the governor
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
and many
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh groups like appalachian mountain club
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
trails groups very enthusiastic about
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
broadening bicycling kayaking all kinds
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
of things
 
01:03:58.630 --> 01:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying is the executive
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
is doing their job
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
i i think they really are getting uh yes
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
to tie it to
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals may not be
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
sort of a slope of activity going upward
 
01:04:16.559 --> 01:04:17.349 align:start position:0%
sort of a slope of activity going upward
right

01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
because it would be affected by sort of
 
01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.069 align:start position:0%
because it would be affected by sort of
this

01:04:20.069 --> 01:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
fits and starts of
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
of a particular year of
 
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
tourism and i think they're trying to
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
get away from that that's my
 
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
understanding i haven't had a briefing
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
on the topic it's only from what i've
 
01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:34.549 align:start position:0%
on the topic it's only from what i've
read

01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
read
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
i agree with you
 
01:04:36.079 --> 01:04:36.340 align:start position:0%
i agree with you
and

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:36.350 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:37.510 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
we don't giving up the pie we just
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
then do i hear a motion
 
01:04:51.119 --> 01:04:52.950 align:start position:0%
then do i hear a motion
session

01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
yes we need to go under executive
 
01:04:54.799 --> 01:04:56.069 align:start position:0%
yes we need to go under executive
session

01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
i guess we're still in it but that's all
 
01:04:57.839 --> 01:05:00.230 align:start position:0%

um

01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
major mr chair thank you very much
 
01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
question that should always be on this
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
particular tax this is more of a
 
01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
user fee than a tax and it's not really
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
a it's called a communications tax but
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
if i'm not mistaken the monies go almost
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
exclusively to operating the e 911
 
01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.829 align:start position:0%
exclusively to operating the e 911
system

01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:08:50.839 --> 01:08:52.789 align:start position:0%
system
so

01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:57.749 --> 01:08:57.759 align:start position:0%
if future legislation is goes forward
 
01:08:57.759 --> 01:08:58.470 align:start position:0%
if future legislation is goes forward
the

01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
amount of this
 
01:09:04.829 --> 01:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
fee should likely be tied to the cost to
 
01:09:04.839 --> 01:09:06.390 align:start position:0%
fee should likely be tied to the cost to
operate

01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
operate
 
01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
am i saying that
 
01:09:08.239 --> 01:09:09.910 align:start position:0%
am i saying that
correctly

01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
there was
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:18.799 align:start position:0%
that the 911 was an additional
 
01:09:18.799 --> 01:09:19.510 align:start position:0%
that the 911 was an additional
p

01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
p
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
put on top of the regular fee
 
01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:24.070 align:start position:0%
put on top of the regular fee
so

01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
that the bulk of it
 
01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
does not go to 911 but 911 is serviced
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
by it
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
well if this is just
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
a tax tax to raise
 
01:09:36.239 --> 01:09:37.590 align:start position:0%
a tax tax to raise
money

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.829 align:start position:0%
money
then

01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
who cares but if the money is tied
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
directly to
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
a usage or a service provided by the
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
state that's entirely different and
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
whichever way the vote comes out of
 
01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
committee today
 
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
that distinction
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
should be made
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
so if uh
 
01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
regardless of how we're going to do it
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
that that should be done
 
01:10:01.679 --> 01:10:02.870 align:start position:0%
that that should be done
right

01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
yeah looking back at my notes i saw that
 
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons we had put this off
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
was because we could not figure out the
 
01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:25.430 align:start position:0%
was because we could not figure out the
impact

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
of this tax given that uh landline
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
still not close enough given that
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
landline uh communication
 
01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh was decreasing and we brought up the
 
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
question about uh products such as zoom
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
that use um and and the like that use
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
communication services
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
but one of the major reasons we didn't
 
01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
move forward was because we we didn't
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
couldn't really identify
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
the size of this
 
01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:55.669 align:start position:0%
the size of this
decrease

01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
so i mean i think
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
to move ahead with something where we
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
can't really identify this needs
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
this needs more study um i probably
 
01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:05.430 align:start position:0%
this needs more study um i probably
would

01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
recommend that we not
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
move forward with this at this point and
 
01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
if uh you know
 
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
more research is done and we get more
 
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
information on it this could be brought
 
01:11:17.669 --> 01:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh back again
 
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:20.560 align:start position:0%

this

01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
is not this does not go to the e911
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
system except that it goes to the
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
general fund and maybe the general fund
 
01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:37.430 align:start position:0%
general fund and maybe the general fund
helps

01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
helps
 
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh with this one
 
01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:40.390 align:start position:0%
uh with this one
on

01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
this but this is it used to be a major
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
tax when all we had was landlines
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
on and when on the communications
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
companies couldn't play games with how
 
01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
much was being taxed
 
01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.750 align:start position:0%
much was being taxed
on

01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
we on got on grand we got on
 
01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:03.350 align:start position:0%
we on got on grand we got on
grandfathered

01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
grandfathered
 
01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
two years before the feds on
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
grandfathered everybody on this and we
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
can't use it for
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
internet stuff
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
if you spend a lot of time going down
 
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
through your phone bill
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
you may
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
discover that
 
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
on you are paying maybe a dollar
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
a month
 
01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
in this tax at the most
 
01:12:29.199 --> 01:12:30.229 align:start position:0%
in this tax at the most
on

01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
they they really
 
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh have
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
said it so that
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
if when you are making a phone call
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
phone calls the same number of phone
 
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
calls i used to make on my landline i'm
 
01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
making them on my cell phone and my
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
landline and the bills
 
01:12:51.199 --> 01:12:52.630 align:start position:0%
landline and the bills
are

01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:54.229 align:start position:0%
are
are

01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
paying doing that i think it's seven
 
01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
percent on
 
01:12:58.480 --> 01:12:59.510 align:start position:0%
percent on
a

01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:00.630 align:start position:0%
a
very

01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
much smaller
 
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh number uh amount
 
01:13:05.199 --> 01:13:06.149 align:start position:0%
uh number uh amount
of

01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
my activity that is what
 
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
on not internet
 
01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.990 align:start position:0%
on not internet
uh

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
except that it's going over the internet
 
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
now everything is going over the
 
01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.030 align:start position:0%
now everything is going over the
internet

01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
internet
 
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:21.990 align:start position:0%
so um
it's

01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
shrunk to
 
01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
around 32 at this point million 39.6
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
39.6 that was the
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
revenue for 21. we were still getting
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
39.6 out of it but it's going down every
 
01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.790 align:start position:0%
39.6 out of it but it's going down every
year

01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:42.430 align:start position:0%
year
but

01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
39.6 million
 
01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
pays for
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
39.6 million worth of
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
programs that the state does
 
01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:54.709 align:start position:0%
programs that the state does
for

01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:13:54.719 --> 01:13:55.510 align:start position:0%
for
the

01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
businesses the
 
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
communities and the households
 
01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:01.990 align:start position:0%
communities and the households
and

01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
every time we cut revenues
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
those programs
 
01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
get cut too the money has to come from
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
somewhere and they end up in the hands
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
of the municipalities
 
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
and the municipalities cannot do those
 
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
particular programs as efficiently
 
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.990 align:start position:0%
particular programs as efficiently
as

01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
as the state can
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
so we are increasing the tax burden on
 
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
the citizens and saying that we
 
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
decreased it this is true across our tax
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
system at this point the property taxes
 
01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
keep going up
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
state taxes
 
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
either stay the same
 
01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:45.830 align:start position:0%
either stay the same
or

01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
or they go up in
 
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
in our case in spurts
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
a year or two after
 
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
after the
 
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
the tax was changed
 
01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:59.590 align:start position:0%
the tax was changed
and

01:14:59.590 --> 01:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:00.550 align:start position:0%
and
uh

01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
we really
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
until we
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
totally reform the tax system which i
 
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
think won't happen in my lifetime
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
we've got we've got to recognize this
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
we've got to deal with this
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
when we are cutting further into our
 
01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:17.990 align:start position:0%
when we are cutting further into our
revenues

01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
um in a good time when we get to the bad
 
01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:21.990 align:start position:0%
um in a good time when we get to the bad
time

01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
things fall apart on
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
i've got social service agencies that
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
didn't get paid for six months
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
and had to depend on local donations to
 
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
try to stay open for senior citizens and
 
01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:41.510 align:start position:0%
try to stay open for senior citizens and
open

01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
open
 
01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.110 align:start position:0%
open
and

01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
and the county taxes had to go up to pay
 
01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
for more in the nursing homes
 
01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:49.189 align:start position:0%
for more in the nursing homes
on

01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's been going on since 20
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
the whole time i've been there
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
this is associated with the
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
communication yes it is um
 
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.189 align:start position:0%
communication yes it is um
i

01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
i think that any
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
recommending any uh
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
tax reduction to go forward in the next
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
term when we haven't figured out what's
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
going on is
 
01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:15.750 align:start position:0%
going on is
on

01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
is not in the interests of of the state
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative phillips
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
just to follow off those last sets of
 
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
comments um is it's my sense that the
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
reasoning that we were not suggesting
 
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
legislation moved forward on hb
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
1204 also applies to hb 1500 and that
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
i would urge caution for us to be able
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
to assess recent reductions in tax
 
01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:49.990 align:start position:0%
to assess recent reductions in tax
revenues

01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
um in the coming months so that we can
 
01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
get a better grasp of what's going on
 
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
before we make another you know
 
01:16:58.630 --> 01:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
potential reduction of 39 million plus
 
01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars so
 
01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:01.189 align:start position:0%
million dollars so
um

01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
you know it's my it's my thought that
 
01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
you know if we're going to be
 
01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
intellectually honest that we should
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
continue to
 
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
um remember the comments we made just a
 
01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
few moments ago
 
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
and to um to apply that to hb 500 1500
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
as well thank you mr chair
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:23.189 --> 01:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i so my my thought is
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
similar i'd i'd like to just know before
 
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
we start cutting any kind of
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
revenue like this that we have a good
 
01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
understanding of
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
what this funds
 
01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
and how that would affect them
 
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
should we cut this so
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we as a committee have
 
01:17:51.870 --> 01:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
a full understanding of uh what what the
 
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
39.6 million dollars is going towards
 
01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:55.669 align:start position:0%
39.6 million dollars is going towards
and

01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
if if it has
 
01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:59.110 align:start position:0%
if if it has
value

01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
value
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
or they're good programs i don't know
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
representative brownie
 
01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
well to answer that question i i don't
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
think the these funds are really
 
01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.550 align:start position:0%
think the these funds are really
earmarked

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
earmarked
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
for a specific thing i think they want
 
01:18:10.239 --> 01:18:10.950 align:start position:0%
for a specific thing i think they want
to

01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
in the general fund
 
01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.630 align:start position:0%
in the general fund
and

01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
and you know it's up to finance how they
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
they spend that money but we could find
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
out how many how many
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
if there's anything related to telecom
 
01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:24.149 align:start position:0%
if there's anything related to telecom
that's

01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
that general fund money is being used
 
01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:26.950 align:start position:0%
that general fund money is being used
for

01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:27.910 align:start position:0%
for
so

01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh same same arguments as before
 
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
as the last bill
 
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
we don't know and and note in the in the
 
01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:35.669 align:start position:0%
we don't know and and note in the in the
bill

01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:18:35.679 --> 01:18:38.310 align:start position:0%
bill
sorry

01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
would represent hawker and phillips want
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
to make the motion
 
01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
i wanted to make a comment
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
okay representative talker first uh
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i think is um
 
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
oh no
 
01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i think is true
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
about new hampshire is that we have a
 
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
large number
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
of revenue sources
 
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
unlike most states which are quite
 
01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
dependent on a very few revenue sources
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
and over time
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
this has allowed for stability
 
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire that has not been true
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
of some other states so before we cut
 
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
out all these little
 
01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:19.750 align:start position:0%
out all these little
uh

01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
sources of revenue i think we need to
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
have a better appreciation
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
of how
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has managed to live
 
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
without sales and income tax and it has
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
to do with a broad
 
01:19:34.159 --> 01:19:35.189 align:start position:0%
to do with a broad
number

01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
and we've added to it with
 
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming sports betting you
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
know we've done uh some things that have
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
brought in revenues
 
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh as other things have fallen but we
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
have kept a large number of revenue
 
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
sources and i think that
 
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
probably that's where the committee
 
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
should start next
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh year in the orientation is getting a
 
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
better more formal grasp
 
01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
of what of that truth that more revenue
 
01:20:09.189 --> 01:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
sources it isn't
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
added revenues it's the number of
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
sources is a real plus for this state
 
01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
okay before i go to park uh
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
hacking phillips i apologize for cutting
 
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
representative brown in the office
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
around me yeah the chair thought i was
 
01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
making a motion i don't know i was i
 
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
didn't know no no no no he thought i was
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
making a motion i no i was i was just
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
commenting you know
 
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh tucker yeah absolutely
 
01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:36.630 align:start position:0%
representative uh tucker yeah absolutely
right

01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
that we've had these these all these
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
different taxes
 
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
little ones
 
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
that have really helped us in
 
01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.550 align:start position:0%
that have really helped us in
downturns

01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
downturns
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
maybe that biz maybe business taxes
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
declined but other ones have stayed
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
stayed fine
 
01:20:53.189 --> 01:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
and that that's helped us out of
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
recessions over the time because our
 
01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
recession seemed to be
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
less we have a smaller trough
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
right right right we kind of smooth it
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
with all these smaller taxes so
 
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
and i again for the reasons i stated in
 
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
the prior bill i i i don't think uh we
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
need to to get rid of this tax it's
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
already kind of baked into everybody's
 
01:21:16.630 --> 01:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
phone bills knowing that most people
 
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
didn't realize it's there
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.750 align:start position:0%
and uh
and

01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
and i understand that the the analysis
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
the dra was a static analysis
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
for just the reasons we talked about
 
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
because they didn't know they don't know
 
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
because this this this is a tax that's
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
in transition
 
01:21:40.149 --> 01:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
and as we in terms of of the different
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
products that are being taxed and not
 
01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:42.709 align:start position:0%
products that are being taxed and not
taxed

01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
taxed
 
01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
so i get i think even the dra is trying
 
01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
to get a handle on that as to
 
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
whether the
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
what we're going to tax is going up or
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
what we're going to tax is going down so
 
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
anyway i i would i would i don't want to
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
make the motion but i'll i'll support a
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
no motion if someone makes that
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
before we go to the motion
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative phillips representative
 
01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:05.030 align:start position:0%
representative phillips representative
bernstein

01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
bernstein
 
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i just i think it's important to
 
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
um at least cite the other side of the
 
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
argument the the sponsor of the bill
 
01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:15.750 align:start position:0%
argument the the sponsor of the bill
um

01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
said that this would save new hampshire
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
families about three to five dollars a
 
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
month he also pointed out that this is
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
as regressive of a tax as you can get it
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
it's not dependent on your income it's
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
dependent on your cell phone bill which
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
is pretty much a necessity now so it's
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
extremely regressive
 
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
and then look we all understand that the
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
revenue from this tax continues to go
 
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
down as landlines are used less and less
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
there's a cost to collecting the tax
 
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
and as the revenue drops we're just not
 
01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
getting as good of a bang for our buck
 
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:50.719 align:start position:0%
as we were in previous years
 
01:22:50.719 --> 01:22:51.590 align:start position:0%
as we were in previous years
so

01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
if if you are going to cut taxes this
 
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
would be a good one one final point
 
01:22:59.110 --> 01:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
where meals and rooms tax
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
business profits tax
 
01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes benefits non-residents of new
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire a reduction of this tax or an
 
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
elimination of this tax would be to the
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
sole benefit of new hampshire residents
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
and taxpayers
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
and i think um i mean i'm hearing a lot
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
of the arguments from the other side i
 
01:23:19.350 --> 01:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
just think it's important to highlight
 
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:20.719 align:start position:0%
the other position
 
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:25.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you i just want to clear something
 
01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
up for representative aaron the finance
 
01:23:30.719 --> 01:23:31.750 align:start position:0%
up for representative aaron the finance
committee

01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
just as as we don't appropriate money
 
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
the finance committee
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't designate
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
money for specific places unless they
 
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
create a dedicated fund
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
if they create a dedicated fund it is no
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
longer in the regular budget
 
01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:51.189 align:start position:0%
longer in the regular budget
so

01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:51.199 --> 01:23:52.229 align:start position:0%
so
on

01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:23:52.239 --> 01:23:53.430 align:start position:0%
on
that

01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:54.550 align:start position:0%
that
on

01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:55.870 align:start position:0%
on
that

01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:58.390 --> 01:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
39.7 million
 
01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
went to
 
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
into a general
 
01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:03.510 align:start position:0%
into a general
pool

01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
pool
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
and cannot be determined as to what it's
 
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
paying for
 
01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:09.510 align:start position:0%
paying for
but

01:24:09.510 --> 01:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
we can look at the general pool and say
 
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
that it is getting bigger or it is
 
01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:18.639 align:start position:0%
getting smaller and when it is getting
 
01:24:18.639 --> 01:24:19.750 align:start position:0%
getting smaller and when it is getting
smaller

01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
then on
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
it's frequently the departments that
 
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
have to decide what they're cutting out
 
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
of their budgets
 
01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
and what they're delaying paying for
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
and sometimes never paying for
 
01:24:41.189 --> 01:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
when we run into a recessionary period
 
01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
and because it's past the budget time
 
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
when we realize that there aren't enough
 
01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:48.310 align:start position:0%
when we realize that there aren't enough
revenues

01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
the department commit the commissioners
 
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
who are
 
01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
appointed for
 
01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
four to six
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
four to five years each
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
are the ones who make that decision
 
01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
and they may or may not be influenced by
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
the governor if it's a good governor the
 
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%

establishing a county nursing home

well since this was my bill i'd like to
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
speak to it
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:48.709 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
so

01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
originally i i was seeking to have a
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
state fund established
 
01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
a capital reserve fund to help our
 
01:27:57.199 --> 01:27:58.390 align:start position:0%
a capital reserve fund to help our
counties

01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
counties
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
deal with some of the escalating costs
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
of renovating or rebuilding
 
01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
their county nursing home facilities as
 
01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
a result of federal guidelines that have
 
01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
affected the cost
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
of building these uh or doing
 
01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:15.910 align:start position:0%
of building these uh or doing
renovations

01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
renovations
 
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
i know that um now
 
01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:21.110 align:start position:0%
i know that um now
the

01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines institute the fgi
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
which dictates
 
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
how much space you need per resident
 
01:28:31.110 --> 01:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
and other space requirements within a
 
01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:33.189 align:start position:0%
and other space requirements within a
facility

01:28:33.189 --> 01:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
are they are
 
01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
going to private rooms only for our for
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
our nursing home facilities
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
as opposed to you know allowing
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
semi-private rooms or uh three people to
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
a room
 
01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
so that that
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
is a huge cost for our counties when
 
01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
they're doing these renovations and and
 
01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:59.110 align:start position:0%
they're doing these renovations and and
rebuilds

01:28:59.110 --> 01:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
rebuilds
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
i think it might be a good idea to to
 
01:29:08.709 --> 01:29:08.719 align:start position:0%
keep an eye on um what's happening with
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
some of the costs for our counties with
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
regard to the renovating their
 
01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:15.350 align:start position:0%
regard to the renovating their
facilities

01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
i know for the time being
 
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
a um
 
01:29:22.229 --> 01:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
a fund has been set up that has been
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
funded with arpa money through the
 
01:29:24.719 --> 01:29:26.629 align:start position:0%
funded with arpa money through the
gopher

01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
gopher
 
01:29:26.639 --> 01:29:28.070 align:start position:0%
gopher
agency

01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:28.870 align:start position:0%
agency
and

01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
right now counties can apply for some
 
01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
arpa extra arpa and
 
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
funding for them to do that for example
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
sullivan county
 
01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
is uh requesting some funds from this
 
01:29:44.229 --> 01:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
fund that was established and the fund
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
but this is a short-term kind of
 
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
solution because it's with arpa funds
 
01:29:57.110 --> 01:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
and it is um not
 
01:29:59.669 --> 01:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
going to be there forever
 
01:29:59.679 --> 01:30:00.550 align:start position:0%
going to be there forever
so

01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
it it might be worth looking at um
 
01:30:06.149 --> 01:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
establishing some sort of
 
01:30:06.159 --> 01:30:07.669 align:start position:0%
establishing some sort of
county

01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
county
 
01:30:10.149 --> 01:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
capital reserve fund at the state level
 
01:30:11.430 --> 01:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
at some point
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
because as our counties continue to want
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
to renovate
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
and update their facilities they are
 
01:30:19.590 --> 01:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
going to need some help to do it it's
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
just becoming
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
way too cost prohibitive
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
to rely on just their
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers for their counties and that's
 
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
additional questions or comments
 
01:30:37.590 --> 01:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
represent southward
 
01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
i don't have really an issue with going
 
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
forward as she said and studying this
 
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
because i do think in some areas that
 
01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
may reach actually a crisis level you
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
know as we go on so we might as well
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
am i am i hearing that
 
01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:01.350 align:start position:0%
am i am i hearing that
representative

01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:03.350 align:start position:0%
representative
so

01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
would the recommendation be
 
01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
to consider continue
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
to come up with a bill to continue to
 
01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
study this issue versus this bill
 
01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
is what i'm trying to understand
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
if we would say yes to this would it be
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
more to study
 
01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
the approach
 
01:31:23.669 --> 01:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
because again it comes back to the same
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
old problem you know there are 10
 
01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:26.550 align:start position:0%
old problem you know there are 10
counties

01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
counties
 
01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
who gets the money
 
01:31:30.550 --> 01:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
many many counties have already paid for
 
01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
new or renovated nursing homes already
 
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh all politics is local
 
01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:37.430 align:start position:0%
uh all politics is local
um

01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:39.350 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:40.070 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't mind if if you said yeah i
 
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
would make you know in the blurb it said
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
that that if you made the motion yes
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
if you said that to continue to study
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
would be one thing but
 
01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i'd you know be back in
 
01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
the same place
 
01:31:57.750 --> 01:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
next year if it was the same bill
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
i think that's my opinion
 
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
the motion that we can have is one of
 
01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:04.950 align:start position:0%
the motion that we can have is one of
two

01:32:04.950 --> 01:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
to recommend for future legislative
 
01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
legislation or not recommended
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't say what's in it
 
01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:16.629 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't say what's in it
reptilie

01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
reptilie
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and
 
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
i agree in many ways with representative
 
01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:23.270 align:start position:0%
i agree in many ways with representative
abrami

01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
abrami
 
01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:24.830 align:start position:0%
abrami
um

01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
we added a new wing and rehabilitated
 
01:32:32.229 --> 01:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
everything else about 15 years ago i
 
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
think we finished
 
01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:34.550 align:start position:0%
think we finished
uh

01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
and we cut the budget too low and then
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
had to add more money later on to pay
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
for it
 
01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:42.310 align:start position:0%
for it
because

01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
we'd been
 
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
taken the fed's had had
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
behind us
 
01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:49.510 align:start position:0%
behind us
but

01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
and i think one thing we have to do as a
 
01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
state is to go after that
 
01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:56.149 align:start position:0%
state is to go after that
board

01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:32:58.629 --> 01:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
along with all the other states and get
 
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
them to understand that it's going to be
 
01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
really difficult to afford
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh the baby boomers going through the
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
nursing homes if we're doing it in
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
single room
 
01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:14.070 align:start position:0%
single room
occupancy

01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
occupancy
 
01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:15.669 align:start position:0%
occupancy
but

01:33:15.669 --> 01:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
for this one i think that if we
 
01:33:19.199 --> 01:33:20.709 align:start position:0%
for this one i think that if we
we

01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
the one thing we could do is not
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
recommended and in the blurbs say but a
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
let me remind you this
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
whatever we do here either recommend or
 
01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
not recommend
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:47.669 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:51.669 --> 01:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
mr chair mr chair over here
 
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
rubs and rams
 
01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:54.229 align:start position:0%
rubs and rams
yeah

01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
i you know i actually i'm okay
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
if it says recommend for future
 
01:34:02.830 --> 01:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
legislation or recommend against
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
um i i'm perfectly happy to be for
 
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
future legislation with a blurb that
 
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
makes it clear that what we're
 
01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
we're for is
 
01:34:16.629 --> 01:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
a is a study of
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
da da
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
and that's good enough for me and it uh
 
01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:22.310 align:start position:0%
and that's good enough for me and it uh
it

01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
essentially says
 
01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
there's a problem here that needs to be
 
01:34:29.189 --> 01:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
addressed but we don't know exactly what
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
it is and
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
it's essentially sending the message
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
that what we have in front of us isn't
 
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
quite right
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
so that sort of addresses the no side of
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
this discussion but it uh
 
01:34:42.239 --> 01:34:42.950 align:start position:0%
this discussion but it uh
it

01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
says we got to deal with this and that's
 
01:34:50.790 --> 01:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
represent aaron
 
01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
you've heard the discussion
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
that uh before we go back to you reps
 
01:34:58.320 --> 01:34:59.510 align:start position:0%
that uh before we go back to you reps
and

01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair
 
01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
one thing that hasn't been uh remarked
 
01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:04.550 align:start position:0%
one thing that hasn't been uh remarked
on

01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:35:06.629 --> 01:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
is that unlike the municipalities
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
counties have their own existence
 
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
separate from the state they they exist
 
01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
separate from the state that matter of
 
01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:14.550 align:start position:0%
separate from the state that matter of
fact

01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
many people would say they pre-exist the
 
01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:19.350 align:start position:0%
many people would say they pre-exist the
state

01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
therefore each county can do
 
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
what it wants under our constitution
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
towns and cities can't
 
01:35:28.629 --> 01:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
the county can each of the other
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
counties has taken their own
 
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
actions regarding a wide variety of
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
cases from stopping to maintaining uh
 
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
county roads
 
01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:40.070 align:start position:0%
county roads
to

01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:35:42.149 --> 01:35:42.159 align:start position:0%
establishing a nursing home to
 
01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
maintaining or not maintaining
 
01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh at least in two situations uh
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
county jails
 
01:35:53.110 --> 01:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
it's up to the county which has its own
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
existence to deal with that separate
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
from the state now whether the state
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
should get involved in the counties thus
 
01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
decreasing the authority of the counties
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
i know there was some legislation in the
 
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
past to re
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
remove the counties which would have
 
01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
required a constitutional amendment but
 
01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
um that
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
do we the the question is do we want the
 
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
counties to be counties
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
or do we want this to be
 
01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
one big state
 
01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
1.7 million people
 
01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
it takes three hours to get from one
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
side of the town to the other of course
 
01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
los angeles has got more and it takes
 
01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
robson and aaron
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
yes and one thing thank you for that
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
and one thing i do want to add is that
 
01:36:47.109 --> 01:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
our counties are not statutorily
 
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
obligated to have nursing home
 
01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:51.510 align:start position:0%
obligated to have nursing home
facilities

01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
so i mean there's that
 
01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:55.669 align:start position:0%
so i mean there's that
but

01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:36:55.679 --> 01:36:56.550 align:start position:0%
but
the

01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
fact of the matter is the counties are
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
still charged by the state
 
01:37:01.679 --> 01:37:03.030 align:start position:0%
still charged by the state
money

01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:37:05.669 --> 01:37:05.679 align:start position:0%
for to take care of their citizens
 
01:37:05.679 --> 01:37:06.470 align:start position:0%
for to take care of their citizens
and

01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
money is going back from the counties to
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
the state to do that
 
01:37:12.239 --> 01:37:13.109 align:start position:0%
the state to do that
um

01:37:13.109 --> 01:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:13.119 --> 01:37:14.070 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
we do have a a uh
 
01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
a um
 
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
you know a situation where
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
we are beholden to the state for for
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
funds you know that we have to give the
 
01:37:29.830 --> 01:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
state funds
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
um but by the same token in providing
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
these medical services for our
 
01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:38.070 align:start position:0%
these medical services for our
low-income

01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
low-income
 
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
seniors and and people who need them
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's becoming that much more
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
expensive for our counties to do this
 
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
based on outside so you know outside
 
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
things that we have no control over
 
01:37:57.590 --> 01:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
and that's a problem and i think that's
 
01:37:59.910 --> 01:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
something that at least we have to keep
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
an eye on and and possibly study and
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
take a seat take a look and see
 
01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:05.510 align:start position:0%
take a seat take a look and see
uh

01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
how that's affecting everything
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
so if you
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
make a motion
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
but for the right recommendation and in
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
the blurred uh
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
talk about study
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments
 
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh represented
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:29.669 align:start position:0%
i mean
we

01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
so i'd make a motion to
 
01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
to uh study that to um
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
i'd recommend this for future study
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
for future legislation future
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
legislation to study the issue
 
01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:45.510 align:start position:0%
legislation to study the issue

01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:47.350 --> 01:38:47.360 align:start position:0%
i'll second that mr chairman and
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
then saying none
 
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:00.880 align:start position:0%

01:40:39.510 --> 01:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
robinson southwood
 
01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
so this is one that i followed closely
 
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
in my career i was very aware of the
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
crisis and
 
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know the broad effects
 
01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:54.790 align:start position:0%
you know the broad effects
um

01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:56.470 --> 01:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
i was uh
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
interested in reading the rules
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
um but i found they didn't have some of
 
01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
the details that i would like there
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
basically will be competitive grant
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
programs for the funds
 
01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
at the county and municipal level
 
01:41:11.590 --> 01:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
one of my issues with grants that are
 
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
competitive is some counties are much
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
better at writing grants and dotting
 
01:41:18.910 --> 01:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
eyes and crossing t's and the same with
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities so i'm just hoping the
 
01:41:25.350 --> 01:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
people overseeing the grants recognize
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
that with the opioid crisis there are
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
areas of the state with greater need
 
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
than others
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
and those may not be the same match as
 
01:41:34.390 --> 01:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
the people who are the best at writing
 
01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
grants and so i do really think uh there
 
01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
has to be this overview
 
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
i also think they should make some of it
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh as easy as they can for example most
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
communities need help affording the cost
 
01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
of narcan
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to see some type of rule
 
01:41:53.669 --> 01:41:53.679 align:start position:0%
where you know it's relatively easy to
 
01:41:56.229 --> 01:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
document your usage of narcan and get
 
01:41:58.950 --> 01:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursed and so on um again so it's
 
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
very even in in terms of the
 
01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:03.350 align:start position:0%
very even in in terms of the
disbursement

01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
disbursement
 
01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:04.470 align:start position:0%
disbursement
um

01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
to me this program is i mean the problem
 
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
is gigantic and i still think sometimes
 
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
people don't quite grab onto it um
 
01:42:15.669 --> 01:42:15.679 align:start position:0%
in our county uh we have a diversion
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
program and we have individuals uh you
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
know that are working uh
 
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
can't even decide what word you'd use
 
01:42:26.229 --> 01:42:26.239 align:start position:0%
but you know they are addicts and they
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
are working very hard
 
01:42:30.629 --> 01:42:30.639 align:start position:0%
but when we have what sometimes our
 
01:42:34.470 --> 01:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
graduation ceremonies they have a lawyer
 
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
family members a social worker
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
one or two doctors a court system person
 
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
there there are seven to ten people
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
for each case
 
01:42:47.590 --> 01:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh and then they may relapse so i think
 
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
and i also didn't mention that probably
 
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
someone from their business
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh their boss or someone who is
 
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
supporting them from their business so
 
01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
it really uh it's very large
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
and i don't you know what i'm hearing so
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
far i'm not sure we even yet know the
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
best way really to address it we have
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
different programs that work but i'm not
 
01:43:09.910 --> 01:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
at all sure
 
01:43:11.910 --> 01:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
we have the big picture
 
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
of how to address it
 
01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
so again i you know i think it will
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
really depend on helping people writing
 
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
the right grants having overviews
 
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
all those kinds of things i just see it
 
01:43:25.590 --> 01:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
as quite complicated
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
and i don't see based on this bill
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
that we can really make a change right
 
01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:31.830 align:start position:0%
that we can really make a change right
now

01:43:31.830 --> 01:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
because the funds are just beginning to
 
01:43:35.590 --> 01:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
come in they're just beginning to
 
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
disperse them so it seems to me um
 
01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
really we aren't even there yet as far
 
01:43:43.669 --> 01:43:43.679 align:start position:0%
as deciding we need to change something
 
01:43:45.510 --> 01:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
about the approach
 
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh and the only other thing i'd add is
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
um you know for people who haven't had
 
01:43:51.910 --> 01:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
the experience
 
01:43:53.590 --> 01:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
if you do know someone who's been
 
01:43:54.629 --> 01:43:54.639 align:start position:0%
through this
 
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
and uh you know has used fentanyl when
 
01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
they're taking care of the young
 
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
children and died there with them um you
 
01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
know this is what's happening all around
 
01:44:04.470 --> 01:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
the state still
 
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
 
01:44:08.950 --> 01:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
so my recommendation is that we not move
 
01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:10.870 align:start position:0%
so my recommendation is that we not move
forward

01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
represents billsbury
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
i concur
 
01:44:24.149 --> 01:44:24.159 align:start position:0%
it just seems to me that the specific
 
01:44:26.629 --> 01:44:26.639 align:start position:0%
ways and means context
 
01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
of allocating funds has become moot the
 
01:44:31.590 --> 01:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
program's sailing ahead
 
01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure oversight and review from
 
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
the appropriate committee will be in
 
01:44:37.990 --> 01:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
order for the next legislature but i
 
01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
don't see the role of this committee in
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:45.669 --> 01:44:45.679 align:start position:0%
representative aaron
 
01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so just a reminder of
 
01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
to begin with
 
01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:56.719 align:start position:0%
was to
 
01:44:56.719 --> 01:44:58.390 align:start position:0%
was to
alter

01:44:58.390 --> 01:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
alter
 
01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
the allocation formula
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
counties were not being
 
01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:04.940 align:start position:0%
counties were not being
um

01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:04.950 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:06.550 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
given a a
 
01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
a penalty
 
01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
based on population
 
01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:14.830 align:start position:0%
based on population
and

01:45:14.830 --> 01:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
because their programs are different
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
than the programs that municipalities
 
01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
might have established
 
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
if you had say sullivan county
 
01:45:30.629 --> 01:45:30.639 align:start position:0%
getting penalized for
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh claremont
 
01:45:35.109 --> 01:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
the population of claremont being taken
 
01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:38.639 align:start position:0%
out of their amount a pot of money
 
01:45:41.109 --> 01:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't this this bill sought to
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
fix that
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
some people saw that as double counting
 
01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
i don't see it as double counting
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
but in any case i mean the the
 
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
allocation formula that we currently
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
have was something that was put together
 
01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
by a
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
a judge from another
 
01:45:57.679 --> 01:45:59.030 align:start position:0%
a judge from another
state

01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
and there have been states who have
 
01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
already altered their allocation
 
01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:05.910 align:start position:0%
already altered their allocation
formulas

01:46:05.910 --> 01:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
formulas
 
01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
away from what that judge had decided
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
i guess there's some wisdom in in
 
01:46:14.629 --> 01:46:14.639 align:start position:0%
looking to see uh
 
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
where everything shakes out when funds
 
01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
start flowing and money gets allocated
 
01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:21.350 align:start position:0%
start flowing and money gets allocated
out

01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
but by the same token i think that
 
01:46:25.350 --> 01:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
there's going to be this mentality
 
01:46:27.669 --> 01:46:27.679 align:start position:0%
afterwards that's going to say
 
01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
oh well
 
01:46:30.629 --> 01:46:30.639 align:start position:0%
we can't change it now because we've
 
01:46:33.189 --> 01:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
already started allocating money
 
01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
and and i think that's unfortunate
 
01:46:37.510 --> 01:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
because we will lose
 
01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to kind of fine-tune it
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
and get it right in terms of how we
 
01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
allocate the funds coming in from these
 
01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
opioid settlements
 
01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
so that's all i have to say about this
 
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
bill i
 
01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:51.590 align:start position:0%
bill i
again

01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:46:53.590 --> 01:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
would like to see some more
 
01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
for us to to to see some reports and see
 
01:46:58.709 --> 01:46:58.719 align:start position:0%
how money is being allocated especially
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
with the grants that are
 
01:47:01.910 --> 01:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
being set up
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
um and i'd like to see how effective
 
01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
these out the current allocation is as
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
opposed to what we could have
 
01:47:13.109 --> 01:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
in the future so i'd like to keep an eye
 
01:47:15.590 --> 01:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
on it and maybe study it in the future
 
01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
representable

01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
representable
 
01:47:22.629 --> 01:47:22.639 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:47:22.639 --> 01:47:24.310 align:start position:0%
okay so
so

01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
the way it's set up now is that 23
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
original political subdivisions that had
 
01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
filed lawsuits
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
and i would assume sullivan calling it
 
01:47:34.149 --> 01:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
was one of those divisions yes correct
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
all the counties i think were uh
 
01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
and i know we spent a lot of time on
 
01:47:41.350 --> 01:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
this bill and we heard from the a.g
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
let's get his name now patheti
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
from the ag's office who
 
01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh basically put the
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
i guess the words around
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh are
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
our procedure if you will
 
01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
that we're using and and in the fund
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
there is another
 
01:47:59.350 --> 01:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
committee or i don't know what you want
 
01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
to call it a a trust fund committee
 
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's making these decisions about
 
01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
these grant requests come in and then we
 
01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
have to approve them
 
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
so that's all in place
 
01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:11.750 align:start position:0%
so that's all in place
uh

01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
and i know we just had another
 
01:48:15.109 --> 01:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
settlement right j j
 
01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
was it j j
 
01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:17.350 align:start position:0%
was it j j
yeah

01:48:17.350 --> 01:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
47 minutes right so
 
01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
so i don't even know what yeah i agree
 
01:48:24.070 --> 01:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
with you one one thing representative is
 
01:48:25.189 --> 01:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
that yes
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
we we need to keep an eye on this to see
 
01:48:30.629 --> 01:48:30.639 align:start position:0%
i think the question is you're bringing
 
01:48:34.149 --> 01:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
up his fairness will will the
 
01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
will the grants be allocated in a fair
 
01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
way and will
 
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
the counties be
 
01:48:42.390 --> 01:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
be treated you know not
 
01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
i know right now the allocation of the
 
01:48:47.910 --> 01:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
15 goes based on pop population correct
 
01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:48.709 align:start position:0%
15 goes based on pop population correct
so

01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
in your small county so i understand
 
01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
your your concern
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
and your problem may be bigger than
 
01:48:54.239 --> 01:48:55.189 align:start position:0%
and your problem may be bigger than
just

01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:48:56.229 --> 01:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
probably be disportioned to your
 
01:48:59.830 --> 01:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
population i guess what you
 
01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:01.189 align:start position:0%
population i guess what you
so

01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know but at this point i think it's
 
01:49:06.629 --> 01:49:06.639 align:start position:0%
a matter of of us as a committee
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
keeping an eye on this and i i wouldn't
 
01:49:11.590 --> 01:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily recommend future recommend
 
01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:13.430 align:start position:0%
necessarily recommend future recommend
legislation

01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:49:15.669 --> 01:49:15.679 align:start position:0%
but maybe some kind of an oversight as
 
01:49:15.679 --> 01:49:16.470 align:start position:0%
but maybe some kind of an oversight as
to

01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
maybe periodically calling in
 
01:49:18.639 --> 01:49:19.750 align:start position:0%
maybe periodically calling in
the

01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:21.590 --> 01:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh the folks overseeing this fund to see
 
01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:22.390 align:start position:0%
uh the folks overseeing this fund to see
if

01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:49:23.910 --> 01:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not going to say i'm not
 
01:49:25.030 --> 01:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
going to i'm not saying that they're not
 
01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
going to be fair
 
01:49:27.750 --> 01:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
but it'd be interesting to see how the
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
money is being allocated uh
 
01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
to the various communities so i'm all
 
01:49:36.149 --> 01:49:36.159 align:start position:0%
set thank you and i saw i'll be
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
supporting a no motion
 
01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:41.669 align:start position:0%
supporting a no motion
representative

01:49:41.669 --> 01:49:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:43.990 --> 01:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you on
 
01:49:47.669 --> 01:49:47.679 align:start position:0%
i think i agree with uh representative
 
01:49:47.679 --> 01:49:49.189 align:start position:0%
i think i agree with uh representative
spillsbury

01:49:49.189 --> 01:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
spillsbury
 
01:49:49.199 --> 01:49:50.149 align:start position:0%
spillsbury
that

01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:52.470 --> 01:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
this is something that the health and
 
01:49:54.870 --> 01:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
human services committee
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
should be evaluating
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh as we go forward we've been kind of
 
01:50:03.590 --> 01:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
had had a difficulty with this partly
 
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
because um the
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
the committee that was formed to
 
01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
to deal with this which is
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
led by
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald
 
01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:17.189 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald
on

01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:50:21.189 --> 01:50:21.199 align:start position:0%
does come more from that side of things
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
and is
 
01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
has has named
 
01:50:29.109 --> 01:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
the aag buffetti as uh
 
01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
as their sole spokesperson
 
01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
on this which
 
01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:35.189 align:start position:0%
on this which
um

01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
i tried to get
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald to come and talk to us
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
too about what they were planning on
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
doing because a number of the questions
 
01:50:46.470 --> 01:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
especially about
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
help for the communities that don't know
 
01:50:53.669 --> 01:50:53.679 align:start position:0%
how to write grants very well on
 
01:50:53.679 --> 01:50:55.109 align:start position:0%
how to write grants very well on
was

01:50:55.109 --> 01:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:50:55.119 --> 01:50:56.390 align:start position:0%
was
on

01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
and the narcan program were
 
01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
on mentioned as things they were trying
 
01:51:05.590 --> 01:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
to get through in the rule that they
 
01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't do until the rules had gotten
 
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
through jail car
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
i think the roles got through jail car
 
01:51:13.199 --> 01:51:14.870 align:start position:0%
i think the roles got through jail car
recently

01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
recently
 
01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
very recently
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
but we don't know what the results of
 
01:51:19.679 --> 01:51:20.390 align:start position:0%
but we don't know what the results of
that

01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
will be but on what senator rosenwald
 
01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
said was
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
was we don't know what we're doing until
 
01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
the rules have allowed us to meet and
 
01:51:32.870 --> 01:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
make those votes
 
01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
which i don't know if that's happened
 
01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:35.510 align:start position:0%
which i don't know if that's happened
yet

01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
yet
 
01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:36.709 align:start position:0%
yet
but

01:51:36.709 --> 01:51:36.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:51:36.719 --> 01:51:37.910 align:start position:0%
but
um

01:51:37.910 --> 01:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
i do think that
 
01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
that unless that
 
01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:45.679 align:start position:0%
those initiatives uh
 
01:51:47.990 --> 01:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
don't work out
 
01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
that uh in practice i think that the
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
the health and human services committee
 
01:51:56.470 --> 01:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
is the one that can evaluate that better
 
01:51:56.480 --> 01:51:57.510 align:start position:0%
is the one that can evaluate that better
than

01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
than we can
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
and actually that this bill
 
01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
is more about
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
well it was about a dedicated fund and
 
01:52:12.070 --> 01:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's how it landed here i think
 
01:52:14.830 --> 01:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
but it was
 
01:52:18.149 --> 01:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
was was about essentially about where
 
01:52:20.310 --> 01:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
you appropriate the money
 
01:52:21.750 --> 01:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
a finance question
 
01:52:25.589 --> 01:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
and then health and human services
 
01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
question because that's the department
 
01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
that does it
 
01:52:33.669 --> 01:52:33.679 align:start position:0%
uh i'm i'm for a no vote at this point
 
01:52:33.679 --> 01:52:34.390 align:start position:0%
uh i'm i'm for a no vote at this point
but

01:52:34.390 --> 01:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
if things don't work out then
 
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
you got a better sense of this bill when
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
you look at the mythology that's printed
 
01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:50.709 align:start position:0%
you look at the mythology that's printed
and

01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:53.189 --> 01:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
you read that and
 
01:52:56.709 --> 01:52:56.719 align:start position:0%
may it would put me on the no
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
path anything else
 
01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:02.639 align:start position:0%
and just briefly mr chair
 
01:53:07.990 --> 01:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:10.470 --> 01:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
it just occurred to me that
 
01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:11.350 align:start position:0%
it just occurred to me that
the

01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:53:13.750 --> 01:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
paperwork that uh was handed out at the
 
01:53:16.149 --> 01:53:16.159 align:start position:0%
beginning by representative ames in 504
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
particularly the
 
01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
equitable and proportional case came out
 
01:53:23.910 --> 01:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
if that case is decided saying that the
 
01:53:26.070 --> 01:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
distribution has to be equitable and
 
01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:29.679 align:start position:0%
proportional the ramifications of that
 
01:53:29.679 --> 01:53:30.709 align:start position:0%
proportional the ramifications of that
would

01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
then be that regardless of what formula
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
was done for any distribution
 
01:53:39.270 --> 01:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
of funds received from any source would
 
01:53:41.189 --> 01:53:41.199 align:start position:0%
therefore have to be equitable and
 
01:53:41.199 --> 01:53:42.550 align:start position:0%
therefore have to be equitable and
proportional

01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
proportional
 
01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:53:47.589 --> 01:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
what was being attempted by this bill
 
01:53:49.109 --> 01:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
couldn't happen
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
because it wouldn't be equitable and
 
01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
proportional it would be
 
01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%
beneficial to one
 
01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
county over another
 
01:54:00.550 --> 01:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
because of population and their size
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of
 
01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
factors that go into this beyond
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
what was attempted but i think i've
 
01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639 align:start position:0%
raised other questions that
 
01:54:12.390 --> 01:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
representative almighty wants to comment
 
01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:13.990 align:start position:0%
representative almighty wants to comment
on

01:54:13.990 --> 01:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:54:15.669 --> 01:54:15.679 align:start position:0%
perhaps an omni
 
01:54:15.679 --> 01:54:16.470 align:start position:0%
perhaps an omni
well

01:54:16.470 --> 01:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
one of the lawyers might be better at
 
01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
this but
 
01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:20.950 align:start position:0%
this but
on

01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
the reason that

the courts
 
01:54:27.589 --> 01:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
opine on the education side is that they
 
01:54:30.870 --> 01:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
created on from the language in the
 
01:54:33.350 --> 01:54:33.360 align:start position:0%

civilly
 
01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
in our committee and i think we have the
 
01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:06.149 align:start position:0%
in our committee and i think we have the
most

01:58:06.149 --> 01:58:06.159 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:58:09.589 --> 01:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
bipartisan committee there is
 
01:58:09.599 --> 01:58:10.950 align:start position:0%
bipartisan committee there is
and

01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:13.350 --> 01:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
what pleased me the most
 
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
is that when we can when we did the
 
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
revenues how we did it
 
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
and then both represent army and i could
 
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
stand up
 
01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:23.669 align:start position:0%
stand up
together

01:58:23.669 --> 01:58:23.679 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:58:26.709 --> 01:58:26.719 align:start position:0%
and present him to the full house
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
and that really shows how we work
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
together we don't
 
01:58:33.750 --> 01:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
i mean we can be republicans we can be
 
01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
democrats and we can vote
 
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
our principles
 
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
but we can still
 
01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
respect each other and we have done that
 
01:58:45.669 --> 01:58:45.679 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:58:49.030 --> 01:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
what more can somebody ask for
 
01:58:52.149 --> 01:58:52.159 align:start position:0%
so i hope everybody has a
 
01:58:54.070 --> 01:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
good rest of the year
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%

01:59:00.229 --> 01:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
committees to go to i'm going to miss
 
01:59:00.239 --> 01:59:06.390 align:start position:0%
committees to go to i'm going to miss
this

01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:07.830 --> 01:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
it's been a pleasure working with all of
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:59:27.750 --> 01:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
yes if at the party we're gonna we're
 
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
gonna spend uh i guess after we eat
 
01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a
 
01:59:32.870 --> 01:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
time to talk
 
01:59:35.430 --> 01:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
about norm your chance to say your
 
01:59:38.790 --> 01:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
then we're going to spend a little time
 
01:59:43.189 --> 01:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
remembering mary as well
 
01:59:45.589 --> 01:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
and then uh remembering all those that
 
01:59:48.310 --> 01:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
we know members here that have already
 
01:59:49.990 --> 01:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
said they are not going to run again or
 
01:59:51.669 --> 01:59:51.679 align:start position:0%
running for the senate
 
01:59:53.350 --> 01:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
and we want to
 
01:59:55.669 --> 01:59:55.679 align:start position:0%
give you a chance to say goodbyes if
 
01:59:56.830 --> 01:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
you'd like
 
01:59:58.709 --> 01:59:58.719 align:start position:0%
okay so that's what that's what we
 
02:00:00.070 --> 02:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
haven't planned for
 
02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:03.510 align:start position:0%
haven't planned for
later

02:00:03.510 --> 02:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:09.990 --> 02:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
you'll probably start getting there by a
 
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
quarter two
 
02:00:15.510 --> 02:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh and it'll take about ten minutes
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
it's if you basically go down north
 
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
north main street and keep on going
 
02:00:23.910 --> 02:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
that intersection
 
02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:29.430 align:start position:0%
that intersection
so

02:00:29.430 --> 02:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
oh the red blazer 72 manchester street
 
02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:38.470 --> 02:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
so if you're heading to the
 
02:00:40.070 --> 02:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's the road heading out to where
 
02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
lottery is if you've ever been out to
 
02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
the lottery building
 
02:00:45.189 --> 02:00:45.199 align:start position:0%
yeah he would go to main street and
 
02:00:47.430 --> 02:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
change his under after he come out
 
02:00:49.109 --> 02:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
underneath the the highway there the
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
innocent under 93 it changed his name to
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
manchester street from nothing
 
02:00:56.310 --> 02:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
and it's on the right
 
02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
it'll be on the right once you get down
 
02:00:57.840 --> 02:00:59.270 align:start position:0%
it'll be on the right once you get down
there

02:00:59.270 --> 02:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:01.109 align:start position:0%
there
huh

02:01:01.109 --> 02:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
huh
 
02:01:02.229 --> 02:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know what hell you're talking
 
02:01:02.239 --> 02:01:06.709 align:start position:0%
i don't know what hell you're talking
about

02:01:06.709 --> 02:01:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:08.390 --> 02:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
you're right you pass common man you go
 
02:01:15.910 --> 02:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
don't think they will well they didn't
 
02:01:38.950 --> 02:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
